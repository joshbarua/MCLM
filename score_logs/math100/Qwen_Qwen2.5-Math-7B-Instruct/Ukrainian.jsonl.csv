"To determine the length of \(DE\), we start by analyzing the given right triangle \(DEF\). We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of \(EF\) is 7. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this triangle, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]

Substituting the given value of \(EF\):

\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:

\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In triangle \(DEF\), we have:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:

\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the point \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) clockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( -\frac{\pi}{4} \) (since clockwise rotation is negative in the complex plane):**
   The rotation by \( -\frac{\pi}{4} \) is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{-i\pi/4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{-i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right)
   \]
   Expanding the product, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right)
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we have:
   \[
   z'' = 1 - i - 3i + 3i^2 = 1 - 4i + 3(-1) = 1 - 4i - 3 = -2 - 4i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) = -2 + 2 - 4i - 3i = -7i
   \]

Thus, the result of the rotation is \(\boxed{-7i}\).","[-1*7*i, '-7i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",False
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that P'єr, Роза, and Тomatoes want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat P'єr, Роза, and Тomatoes as a single ""block"":**
   Since P'єr, Роза, and Тomatoes want to sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the P'єr-Roz-Tom block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks around the table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange P'єr, Роза, and Тomatoes within their block:**
   Within the P'єr-Roz-Tom block, there are 3 people who can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. So, the number of ways to arrange P'єr, Роза, and Тomatoes within their block is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4. **Combine the two results:**
   To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that P'єr, Роза, and Тomatoes sit together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks by the number of ways to arrange P'єr, Роза, and Тomatoes within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that P'єr, Роза, and Тomatoes want to sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term \(T_k\), we get:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot x^{-6}
\]

The \(x^6\) and \(x^{-6}\) cancel each other out, leaving:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

Therefore, the constant term is:

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( n + 2 \), \( n + 4 \), and \( n + 6 \):
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
So, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) becomes:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]
Next, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24
\]
Now, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]
So, \( 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \).

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n = 5\), so the sum of the interior angles is:

\[
(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

Since the pentagon is regular, each interior angle is:

\[
\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
\]

However, we are interested in the angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position. A full rotation is \(360^\circ\), and since the pentagon has five sides, it will return to its original position after rotating by an angle that is a fraction of \(360^\circ\) corresponding to the number of sides. Specifically, the angle of rotation is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is:

"Given the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\), and then determine the value of \(x + y\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since these midpoints are the same, we set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, the midpoint we calculated must be incorrect for this specific pair of vertices. Let's consider another pair of diagonals.

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

And the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Setting these midpoints equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = 6 \implies 5+x = 12 \implies x = 7
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 3+y = 7 \implies y = 4
\]

This does not satisfy \(x > 7\). Let's consider another pair of diagonals.

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

And the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Setting these midpoints equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implisor x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Define the function \( f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \) and the constraint \( g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 \). The gradients are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y) \quad \text{and} \quad \nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\lambda\), we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13 \implies \frac{6y}{x} - \frac{6x}{y} = 9 \implies \frac{6y^2 - 6x^2}{xy} = 9 \implies \frac{6(y^2 - x^2)}{xy} = 9 \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). Solving for \( y \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \), we get

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
y = 2x \quad \text{and} \quad y = -\frac{1}{2}x.
\]

Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we get

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Substituting these values into \( f(x, y) \), we get

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

Substituting \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x \) into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we get

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{2}x \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{1}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies \frac{5}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Substituting these values into \( f(x, y) \), we get

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot \left( -\frac{2}{5} \right) + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 16, and the operator norm of \( A \) is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4.

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

"To compute \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**

   \[
   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   For \(18_9\):

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( t \) represents the weight of one tricycle.
- \( s \) represents the weight of one skew.
- \( g \) represents the weight of one gull.

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. Ten tricycles weigh as much as three skus and one gull.
2. Two tricycles and one gull weigh as much as one skew.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( 10t = 3s + g \)
2. \( 2t + g = s \)

We need to find the value of \( t \) in terms of \( s \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = s - 2t \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[ 10t = 3s + (s - 2t) \]
\[ 10t = 3s + s - 2t \]
\[ 10t = 4s - 2t \]
\[ 10t + 2t = 4s \]
\[ 12t = 4s \]
\[ t = \frac{4s}{12} \]
\[ t = \frac{s}{3} \]

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

The expansion of \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\) is given by:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
We now distribute each term:
\[

\]
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We know that this expression is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]
This gives us the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

We start by solving the fourth equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]
Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]
Now we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the second equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is correct. Finally, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the third equation to verify:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This is also correct. Therefore, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\), and the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius \(r\) of the tank.

First, recall the formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. The rate of change of the volume with respect to time, \(\frac{dV}{dt}\), is given as \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour. The rate of change of the height with respect to time, \(\frac{dh}{dt}\), is given as 4 meters per hour.

We can use the chain rule to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Since the volume \(V\) is a function of \(h\) (specifically, \(V = \pi r^2 h\)), we have:

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
20 = r^2 \cdot 4

Next, we solve for \(r^2\) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[
r^2 = 5
\]
Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \(r\):

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
The function \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x) = ax^2\) occurs at \(x = 0\) if \(a > 0\), and the maximum value occurs at \(x = 0\) if \(a < 0\). However, since we are considering \(x \geq a\), we need to evaluate \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
So, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) if \(a > 0\) and the maximum value is \(a^3\) if \(a < 0\).

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
The function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a straight line with slope \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and if \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing. The value of the function at \(x = a\) is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]
So, the value of the function approaches \(a^2 + 2a\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left.

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once
For the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the value of \(a^3\) (the minimum value of the parabola for \(x \geq a\)) must be less than or equal to the value of \(a^2 + 2a\) (the value of the line as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left). This gives us the inequality:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the inequality holds. We test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8\), which is negative.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625\), which is positive.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2\), which is negative.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12\), which is positive.

The inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds in the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\), \([0, 2]\). Since we are looking for the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph intersects each horizontal line at least once, we take the maximum value in the interval \([0, 2]\), which is \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must be equal to \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find the other roots of the cubic equation. By the factor theorem, we can factor out \(x - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) from the cubic polynomial. Using polynomial division or synthetic division, we can find the other roots.

However, a simpler approach is to consider the specific value of \(\lambda\) that makes the function \(f(x)\) symmetric and has a periodic point of period 2. By symmetry, we can test \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.
\]
Then,
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 4x^4) = 2(2x - 6x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^4) = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4.
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4 = x \implies -8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or the roots of the cubic polynomial \(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0\). By testing \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), we find:
\[
-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -1 + 4 - 6 + 3 = 0.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root. Since \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\), \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a fixed point, not a periodic point of period 2. However, we can check the other roots of the cubic polynomial to find a periodic point of period 2. By symmetry and the properties of the function, we find that \(\lambda = 3\) also works.

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\):

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\):

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by \(\cos 25^\circ\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{1 + \tan 5^\circ}{\tan 25^\circ - 1}.

We recognize that this expression is in the form of the tangent of a sum of angles formula, \(\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\), with \(A = 45^\circ\) and \(B = -20^\circ\):

\[
\tan 45^\circ = 1, \quad \tan(-20^\circ) = -\tan 20^\circ.

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":

- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can focus on the region where \( x \le y \) without loss of generality.

Next, we consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \]
\[ f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \) or \( x = 0 \), respectively. Thus, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

Now, we consider the interior of the region where \( -1 < x < 1 \) and \( -1 < y < 1 \). To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \]
From \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \]
Multiplying both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \), we get:
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]

Simplifying each component, we have:

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(EGN\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides triangle \(AMN\) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \(EGN\) is:
\[

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic progression, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic progression:

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

2. **Adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator**: To convert the fraction into a decimal, we need the denominator to be a power of 10. Since \(10 = 2 \cdot 5\), we need to have the same number of 2's and 5's in the denominator. The denominator \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\) has 2 factors of 2 and 7 factors of 5. To make the number of 2's equal to the number of 5's, we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) (which is \(32\)).

We can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:

2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:

"To determine the probability that the sum of two numbers chosen by pol and Jessy from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. These are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and the rest are odd numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when pol and Jessy each choose a number. Since there are 6 choices for each, the total number of outcomes is:
\[

Now, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both pol and Jessy choose an even number.
2. Both pol and Jessy choose an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only 1 even number, so there is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) way for both pol and Jessy to choose an even number.

For the second scenario, there are 5 odd numbers, so there are \(5 \times 5 = 25\) ways for both pol and Jessy to choose an odd number.

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

The probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

   - The rectangle is formed by 12 squares, each with a side length of 1 unit.
   - The arrangement of the squares forms a rectangle with 3 columns and 4 rows.
   - Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are \(3 \times 4\) units.

2. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   \[

3. **Analyze the diagonals:**
   - There are two diagonals in the rectangle: one from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, and the other from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner.
   - Each diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.

4. **Calculate the area of one right triangle:**
   - Since each diagonal divides the rectangle into two equal parts, the area of one right triangle is half the area of the rectangle.
   \[
   \text{Area of one right triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Area of the rectangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ square units}

5. **Determine the shaded regions:**
   - The shaded regions are the areas of the two right triangles formed by the diagonals.
   - Since each right triangle has an area of 6 square units, the total area of the shaded regions is:
   \[
   \text{Total shaded area} = 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ square units}

However, upon re-evaluation, we notice that the shaded regions are not the entire triangles but specific parts of them. Let's correct this:

6. **Correct shaded regions:**
   - The shaded regions are the areas of the triangles formed by the diagonals within the squares.

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must have at least two trailing zeros.

Next, we need to ensure that the number has at least one factor of 2. Since the number ends in 00, it already satisfies this condition.

Finally, we need to ensure that the number has at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the number must contain at least two 1's to satisfy this condition.

Combining these requirements, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 1100. Let's verify:

- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- It contains two 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 1100 is not a valid solution.

We need to find a larger number. Let's try 11100. The sum of the digits of 11100 is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 11100 is a valid solution.

To confirm, let's check the divisibility:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- The sum of its digits is 3, so it is divisible by 3.
- It contains at least one 1, so it is divisible by 2.

   - The second number is divisible by 5. The numbers on the wheel are 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 3. The only number divisible by 5 is 5.

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by analyzing the given function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \).

First, we use Vieta's formulas to determine the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). For a cubic polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \), Vieta's formulas tell us that the sum of the roots (taken one at a time) is given by:

\[
-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}
\]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are:
- \( a_3 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = -49 \)
- \( a_1 = 623 \)
- \( a_0 = -2015 \)

Using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Next, we consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). This is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to determine how the roots of \( f(x) \) are affected by this shift.

Let \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) be the roots of \( f(x) \). Then, the roots of \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). This is because if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( f(r) = 0 \), and substituting \( x = r - 5 \) into \( g(x) \) gives:

\[
g(r - 5) = f((r - 5) + 5) = f(r) = 0
\]

Thus, \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we sum the roots \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \):

\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5)
\]

This can be simplified as:

\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15
\]

We already know from Vieta's formulas that \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[
49 - 15 = 34
\]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

This implies that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

By solving this, we find that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 9.
\]

Therefore, the value of the original expression is:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + 9 = 12.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its internal angles, except one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of internal angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the total sum of the internal angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the total sum \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of internal angles, we substitute \(S\) with \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of the missing angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each internal angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\).

5. **Set up the inequality:**
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the lower bound:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve the upper bound:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

7. **Combine the results:**
   From the inequalities \(n \geq 8\) and \(n \leq 8\), we conclude:
   \[
   n = 8

Therefore, the number of sides of the convex polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[

1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\

10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.

We see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have:
\[ t = -6 + 23 = 17. \]
Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

**Step 3: Find the total surface area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Since the problem asks for the total surface area in square inches, we need to convert square feet to square inches. There are 144 square inches in a square foot (since \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \)), so:
\[ S = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate radical, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})

This is a difference of squares, which can be expanded using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:

\[

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\), \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To find the average cost of Juan's stamps from the 1970s, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s.
2. Determine the cost of stamps from each country.
3. Calculate the total cost of all stamps from the 1970s.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to find the average cost.

From the table, we can see the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s:
- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

The cost of stamps from each country is:
- Brazil: 6 cents each
- France: 4 cents each
- Peru: 4 cents each
- Spain: 5 cents each

Now, we calculate the total cost for each country:
- Total cost for Brazil: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents/stamp} = 72 \text{ cents}\)
- Total cost for France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cents/stamp} = 48 \text{ cents}\)
- Total cost for Peru: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cents/stamp} = 24 \text{ cents}\)
- Total cost for Spain: \(13 \text{ stamps} \times 5 \text{ cents/stamp} = 65 \text{ cents}\)

Next, we find the total cost of all stamps from the 1970s:
\[72 \text{ cents} + 48 \text{ cents} + 24 \text{ cents} + 65 \text{ cents} = 209 \text{ cents}\]

Then, we calculate the total number of stamps from the 1970s:
\[12 \text{ stamps} + 12 \text{ stamps} + 6 \text{ stamps} + 13 \text{ stamps} = 43 \text{ stamps}\]

Finally, we find the average cost of the stamps from the 1970s by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps:
\[\frac{209 \text{ cents}}{43 \text{ stamps}} \approx 4.813953\]

Rounding this to the nearest tenth of a cent, we get:
\[4.8\]

Therefore, the average cost of Juan's stamps from the 1970s is \(\boxed{4.8}\).","[4.80000000000000, '4.8']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with base \(CD = c\) and height \(AC = d\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

We need to find the relationship between \(c\) and \(d\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal. The height from \(C\) to \(AD\) in \(\triangle ABC\) is the same as the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) in \(\triangle ACD\), which is \(h\).

In \(\triangle ACD\), the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) is \(d\), and the base is \(c\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) in \(\triangle ABC\) is also \(d\). Therefore, the height \(h\) in \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to \(d\).

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d
\]

Since the total area of \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\), we have:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD]
\]
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d + \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times (b + c)
\]
\[
84 = d \times (b + c)
\]

We already know from the area of the trapezoid that:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(h = d\), we substitute \(d\) for \(h\):
\[
(a + b) \times d = 84
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
d \times (b + c) = d \times (a + b)
\]

This implies:
\[
b + c = a + b
\]

However, this is a contradiction unless \(c = a\).

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

To ensure that this solution is valid, we need to check that it satisfies the original equation and the domain of the original equation. The domain requires that \(3x - 1 > 0\), which means \(x > \frac{1}{3}\). Since \(\frac{9}{19} > \frac{1}{3}\), the solution is valid.

Therefore, the solution is:

First, let's write down the expression:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication of the integers \(7\) and \(10\):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Now, we need to multiply this result by the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\):
\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30}
\]

We can simplify this multiplication by canceling out the common factor between \(70\) and \(30\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(70\) and \(30\) is \(10\). Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(10\):
\[
70 \div 10 = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad 30 \div 10 = 3
\]

This simplifies the expression to:
\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30} = 7 \times \frac{21}{3}
\]

Next, we multiply \(7\) by \(\frac{21}{3}\):
\[
7 \times \frac{21}{3} = \frac{7 \times 21}{3}

We perform the multiplication in the numerator:
\[
7 \times 21 = 147

So, the expression becomes:

"To determine the probability that two randomly chosen chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) in a circle intersect, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle.

2. **Geometric Interpretation**: For two chords to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) is separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle. This means that if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, they must alternate: \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\).

3. **Counting Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we can fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining 3 points. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining points. Therefore, there are \(3! = 6\) distinct arrangements of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle.

4. **Identifying Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting: \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) and \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\). So, there are 2 favorable arrangements.

5. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total number of arrangements}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the shaded region. The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the segment of the smaller circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord. The area of the triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2}
\]
The area of the segment of the larger circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord. The area of the triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
2\theta - 2 \sin \theta
\]
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} + 2\theta - 2 \sin \theta = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta + 4\theta - 4 \sin \theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta - 5 \sin \theta}{2} = \frac{5(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2}
\]
We know that this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
\[
\frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]
We need to find the value of \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution because:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = \sin \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

\[
\frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{4\pi - 3\sqrt{3}}{6}

"To determine how many cylindrical mugs of water are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical mug and the spherical reservoir and then find the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical mug. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical mug, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical reservoir, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical mugs are required to fill the spherical reservoir. This is done by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:
\[

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are angles in the interval \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\). Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta).
\]
This expression is a difference of squares:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2.
\]
We know that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\) for any angle \(\theta\). Thus, \(\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84\) and \(\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = (0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75})^2 - (\sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5)^2 = 0.4^2 \cdot 0.75 - 0.5^2 \cdot 0.84 = 0.16 \cdot 0.75 - 0.25 \cdot 0.84.

Calculating each term separately, we have:
\[
0.16 \cdot 0.75 = 0.12,
\]
\[
0.25 \cdot 0.84 = 0.21.

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 republickans and 6 democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one representative from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the subcommittee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee with only republickans or only democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 people (8 republickans and 6 democrats):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only republickans. Since there are 8 republickans, the number of ways to choose 5 out of them is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only democrats. Since there are 6 democrats, the number of ways to choose 5 out of them is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Now, subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only republickans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only democrats from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:
\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

"Let the three consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). The product of these three integers is given by:

\[

\]

The average of these three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product of the three integers divided by their average is 24. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5

We now need to find the three consecutive integers for each value of \( n \).

1. If \( n = 5 \), the three consecutive integers are \( 4, 5, 6 \). The product is:

\[

The average is:

\[

This satisfies the given condition. The largest of these integers is 6.

2. If \( n = -5 \), the three consecutive integers are \( -6, -5, -4 \). The product is:

\[
-6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120

This does not satisfy the given condition because the product is 120, not -120.

"To find the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\). This polynomial can be derived from the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

The product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) is given by \(\frac{1}{8}\) (by Vieta's formulas). However, we need to consider the product of the cosines of the angles, which is the absolute value of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) divided by 8. Since all the roots are positive, the product of the cosines is:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and altitude \( AM = 11 \), we know that \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

Since \( AD = 10 \) and \( AM = 11 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

We are given that \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), \( \angle BDC = 180^\circ - \angle DBC - \angle DCB \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \). Therefore, \( \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} - \angle MBC = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} - 90^\circ + \angle DBM = \frac{180^\circ - \theta - 180^\circ + 2\angle DBM}{2} = \frac{2\angle DBM - \theta}{2} = \angle DBM - \frac{\theta}{2} \).

Since \( \angle DBM = \angle DBA = \frac{\theta}{2} \), we have \( \angle DBC = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = 0 \), which is not possible. Instead, we use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):

\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}
\]

Since \( BC = 2x \), \( BD = CD = \sqrt{BM^2 + DM^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \), and \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:

\[
\frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]

Using the triple angle identity for sine, \( \sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta \), and the half-angle identity for cosine, \( \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = \sin \left( 90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right) = \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \), we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]

In \( \triangle ABM \), by the Pythagorean theorem, \( AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2} \).

In \( \triangle BDM \), by the Pythagorean theorem, \( BD = \sqrt{BM^2 + DM^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \).

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABM \), we have:

\[
\frac{AB}{\sin \angle AMB} = \frac{BM}{\sin \angle BAM}
\]

Since \( \angle AMB = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2} \) and \( \angle BAM = \frac{\theta}{2} \), we get:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{x}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \), we get:

\[
\sqrt{121 + x^2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} = x \cos \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
(121 + x^2) \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = x^2 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

Using the identity \( \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 \), we get:

\[
121 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + x^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = x^2 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
121 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = x^2 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - x^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = x^2 (\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}) = x^2 \cos \theta
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{x^2 \cos \theta}{121}
\]

Substituting \( \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2} \) into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2} = \frac{x^2 \cos \theta}{121}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

\[
1 - \cos \theta = \frac{2x^2 \cos \theta}{121}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 121, we get:

\[
121 - 121 \cos \theta = 2x^2 \cos \theta
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
121 = 2x^2 \cos \theta + 121 \cos \theta = \cos \theta (2x^2 + 121)
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{121}{2x^2 + 121}

Substituting \( \cos \theta = \frac{121}{2x^2 + 121} \) into the equation \( \frac{2x}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} \), we get:

\[
\sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{121}{2x^2 + 121} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(2x^2 + 121)^2 - 121^2}{(2x^2 + 121)^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4x^4 + 484x^2 + 14641 - 14641}{(2x^2 + 121)^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4x^4 + 484x^2}{(2x^2 + 121)^2}} = \frac{2x \sqrt{x^2 + 121}}{2x^2 + 121}
\]

Substituting \( \sin \theta = \frac{2x \sqrt{x^2 + 121}}{2x^2 + 121} \) into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3 \cdot \frac{2x \sqrt{x^2 + 121}}{2x^2 + 121} - 4 \left( \frac{2x \sqrt{x^2 + 121}}{2x^2 + 121} \right)^3} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{2x^2 + 121}} = 2x^2 + 121
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{\frac{6x \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 4 \cdot \frac{8x^3 (x^2 + 121)}{(2x^2 + 121)^3}} = \frac{2x}{\frac{6x \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - \frac{32x^5 + 484x^3}{(2x^2 + 121)^2}} = \frac{2x}{\frac{6x \sqrt{x^2 + 121} (2x^2 + 121) - (32x^5 + 484x^3)}{(2x^2 + 121)^2}} = \frac{2x (2x^2 + 121)^2}{6x \sqrt{x^2 + 121} (2x^2 + 121) - (32x^5 + 484x^3)}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and the denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{2x (2x^2 + 121)^2}{6x (2x^2 + 121) \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 32x^5 - 484x^3} = \frac{2x (2x^2 + 121)^2}{6x (2x^2 + 121) \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 4x^3 (8x^2 + 121)} = \frac{2x (2x^2 + 121)^2}{6x (2x^2 + 121) \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 4x^3 (2x^2 + 121)} = \frac{2x (2x^2 + 121)^2}{2x (2x^2 + 121) (3 \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 2x^2 - 121)} = \frac{2x (2x^2 + 121)}{2x (3 \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 2x^2 - 121)} = \frac{2x^2 + 121}{3 \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 2x^2 - 121}
\]

Since this equals \( 2x^2 + 121 \), we have:

\[
2x^2 + 121 = \frac{2x^2 + 121}{3 \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 2x^2 - 121}
\]

Therefore, \( 3 \sqrt{x^2 + 121} - 2x^2 - 121 = 1 \), so \( 3 \sqrt{x^2 + 121} = 2x^2 + 122 \). Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
9(x^2 + 121) = (2x^2 + 122)^2 \Rightarrow 9x^2 + 1089 = 4x^4 + 488x^2 + 14884 \Rightarrow 4x^4 + 479x^2 + 13795 = 0 \Rightarrow x^2 = 25 \Rightarrow x = 5

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the 27 integers is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:

To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which is always greater than \(-4\). This means that the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \pm\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which gives us:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:

x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the sum of squares:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3ps.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
s^3 - 3ps + 8 = 0.
\]

Now, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). This can be rewritten using the identity:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = sp - 12.
\]
Adding 12 to both sides, we have:
\[
24 = sp.
\]
So, we have:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the equation \(s^3 - 3ps + 8 = 0\), we get:
\[
s^3 - 3s \left(\frac{24}{s}\right) + 8 = 0,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s^3 - 72 + 8 = 0,
\]
or
\[
s^3 - 64 = 0.
\]
This factors to:
\[
(s-4)(s^2 + 4s + 16) = 0.
\]
Since \(s^2 + 4s + 16\) has no real roots (its discriminant is \(4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 16 = 16 - 64 = -48\)), we have:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

"To determine which class has the number of boys who use the bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls who use the bus, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of boys using the bus to the number of girls using the bus for each class and compare it to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of boys and girls using the bus in each class:

1. **9th class:**
   - Number of boys using the bus: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Number of girls using the bus: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.042\)

2. **10th class:**
   - Number of boys using the bus: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Number of girls using the bus: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.040\)

3. **11th class:**
   - Number of boys using the bus: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Number of girls using the bus: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

4. **12th class:**
   - Number of boys using the bus: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Number of girls using the bus: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.344\)

Now, we compare each ratio to \(1.35\):
- For the 9th class: \(1.042\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.042 = 0.308\))
- For the 10th class: \(1.040\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.040 = 0.310\))
- For the 11th class: \(1.5\) (difference: \(1.5 - 1.35 = 0.15\))
- For the 12th class: \(1.344\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.344 = 0.006\))

The smallest difference is \(0.006\), which corresponds to the 12th class.

Therefore, the class with the number of boys who use the bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls who use the bus is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x \leq -9\) and \(x < 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x < -9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 < 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is true, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(-9 < x < 0\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(0 < x < 9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(9 < x < 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x > 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 > 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so the quotient is positive.

Combining all the intervals where the quotient is negative, we get:
\[
(-\infty, -9) \cup (-9, 0) \cup (0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides of the field and two semicircles at the ends. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangular field by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two straight sides of the field each have a length \( L \), and the two semicircles each have a radius \( \frac{W}{2} \). The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{W}{2} \) is \( 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = \pi W \). Therefore, the total length of the two semicircles is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the two semicircles:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We can solve this equation for \( L \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \cdot W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2}
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{200}{2}
\]
\[
L = 200 - 100
\]
\[
L = 100
\]

Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[
\frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
\[
ST = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(ST\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
\[

\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4

\[

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression \( x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). Let \( u = x^2 \). Then the expression becomes a quadratic function in terms of \( u \):

\[
f(u) = u^2 - 4u + 9
\]

This is a quadratic function of the form \( f(u) = au^2 + bu + c \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = 9 \). The minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at \( u = -\frac{b}{2a} \):

\[
u = -\frac{-4}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

Substitute \( u = 2 \) back into the function \( f(u) \):

\[
f(2) = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

Thus, the minimum value of \( x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum value of \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

The minimum distance is expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]

\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]

\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 4 other vertices. The vertices can be placed in a coordinate system such that the octahedron is symmetric.

Let's place the vertices of the octahedron as follows:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

We are given the distances from point \( P \) to five of these vertices:
- \( PA = 3 \)
- \( PB = 7 \)
- \( PC = 8 \)
- \( PD = 9 \)
- \( PE = 11 \)

We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( F \).

First, we use the distance formula in three dimensions:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]

Let the coordinates of point \( P \) be \( (x, y, z) \).

Using the given distances, we can write the following equations:
1. \( PA = 3 \)
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]

2. \( PB = 7 \)
\[
\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]

3. \( PC = 8 \)
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]

4. \( PD = 9 \)
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]

5. \( PE = 11 \)
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2} = 11
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121
\]

We now have a system of five equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 \\
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \\
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 64 \\
x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81 \\
x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121

We subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 55

\[
y^2 - 2y + 2x = 55

\]
\[

Next, we subtract the first equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 81 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 72

\[

\[
y^2 + 2y + 2(10) = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 20 = 72

\[
y = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{53}}{2}

\[
y = -1 \pm \sqrt{53}

Since \( y = 7 \) or \( y = -5 \) must satisfy both equations, we find that \( y = -5 \) is the only consistent solution.

Finally, we subtract the first equation from the fifth:
\[

\[
y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 112

\[
z^2 - 2z + 45 = 112
\]
\[
z^2 - 2z - 67 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
z = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 268}}{2}

\[
z = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{272}}{2}
\]
\[
z = \frac{2 \pm 4\sqrt{17}}{2}

\[
z = 1 \pm 2\sqrt{17}
\]

Thus, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (1, -5, 1 + 2\sqrt{17}) \) or \( (1, -5, 1 - 2\sqrt{17}) \).

Finally, we find the distance from \( P \) to \( F \):
\[
PF = \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (-5 - 0)^2 + (1 + 2\sqrt{17} - (-1))^2}

\[

\[

\]
\[
= \sqrt{4(24.5 + 2\sqrt{17})} \]
\[

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

According to the problem, the force applied to the softball is the same as the force applied to the baseball. Therefore, we can set the two equations for force equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Substituting the mass and acceleration into the equations, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the softball and the baseball:
- Mass of the softball, \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \) g
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) g

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball is:

"To determine how many identical digits are present in the graphs of the number \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The digits in \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, and 6.
The digits in \(1165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, and 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. We count the number of times each common digit appears:
- The digit 1 appears 3 times.
- The digit 5 appears 2 times.
- The digit 6 appears 1 time.

Adding these counts together, we get \(3 + 2 + 1 = 6\).

The number of handshakes between the relationalms and the charikuses can be calculated by multiplying the number of relationalms by the number of charikuses. This is because each relationalm shakes hands with each charikuse exactly once.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:
\[
a + b + c = 0.
\]

Next, we consider the product \(abc\). We can express \(abc\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).

Expanding this product, we get:

\]

Using Vieta's formulas, we substitute \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\) and \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\):
\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2(-2)(-2) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 8.
\]

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\), we have \((\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 4\). Therefore:

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 0,

\[
abc = 32.

The numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0\), which simplifies to:

2. Five erasers and one large eraser cost \$1.82:

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, was left after Лінda, Шerрі, Daniel, and Conny donated the maximum possible amount of money in dollar bills, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money they earned:**
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's add these amounts step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, the total amount of money they earned is:
   \[
   126.59 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Convert the total amount into cents:**
   \[
   126.59 \text{ dollars} = 126 \times 100 + 59 \text{ cents} = 12600 + 59 = 12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the maximum amount they can donate in dollar bills:**
   The maximum amount they can donate in dollar bills is the integer part of the total amount, which is:
   \[
   126 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Convert the maximum donation back into cents:**
   \[
   126 \text{ dollars} = 126 \times 100 = 12600 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount of money left after the donation:**
   \[
   12659 \text{ cents} - 12600 \text{ cents} = 59 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money left after they donated the maximum possible amount of money in dollar bills is:
\[
\boxed{59}

"要 find the average score of the test, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score of all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score. We do this by multiplying the number of students who received each score by that score and then adding these products together.

The total score for the students who received 80 points is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The total score for the students who received 90 points is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The total score for the students who received 100 points is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add these scores together to get the total score for all the students:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the average score of the test is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the numbers in the third row, the columns, and the diagonals using \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the numbers in the third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less James walked compared to Marta, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance James traveled. James walked along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The formula for the length of the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with width \(w\) and length \(l\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{w^2 + l^2} \]

For the given field, the width \(w\) is 300 feet and the length \(l\) is 400 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \text{ feet} \]

So, James traveled 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Marta traveled. Marta walked along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she traveled is the sum of the length and the width:
\[ \text{Distance Marta traveled} = l + w \]
\[ \text{Distance Marta traveled} = 400 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Distance Marta traveled} = 700 \text{ feet} \]

So, Marta traveled 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Marta traveled and the distance James traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Marta traveled} - \text{Distance James traveled} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, James walked \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Marta.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The roots of the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the relations \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we substitute \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Next, we find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.
\]

We can simplify the denominator \(\omega(1 + \omega)\) using the relation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), which implies \(1 + \omega = -\omega^2\):

\[
\omega(1 + \omega) = \omega(-\omega^2) = -\omega^3.
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we have:

\[
-\omega^3 = -1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{-1}{-\omega^3} = \frac{-1}{-1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled by starting at any point \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then find the minimum of these distances.

   - Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\)
   - Route \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
