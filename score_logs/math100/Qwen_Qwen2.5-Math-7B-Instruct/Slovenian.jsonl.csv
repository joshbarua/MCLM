"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of the rotation is:

\boxed{6 - 5i}

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"":**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks around the table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:**
   Within the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block, there are 3 people who can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. So, the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4. **Combine the two results:**
   To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 10^2 x^{6} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{-6}
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 100 x^6 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) x^{-6}
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{25}{2}\right)

\[
= -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}
\]

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 7 \cdot 3 + 3\text{)}

"To determine the smallest number of degrees Pravilni petkotnik must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the properties of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal interior angles. When a regular pentagon is rotated about its center, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides (5).

The angle of rotation for each symmetry of the pentagon is given by:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]
This means that the pentagon will return to its original position after a rotation of 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and a full 360 degrees. The smallest positive rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position is 72 degrees.

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\) with the condition that \(x > 7\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\). We will consider two possible pairs of diagonals and find the coordinates of the fourth vertex for each pair.

### Case 1: Diagonals are between \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\), and between \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\)

1. Calculate the midpoint of the diagonal between \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
   \[
   \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
   \]

2. Set the midpoint equal to the midpoint of the diagonal between \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
   \[
   \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
   \]

3. Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):
   \[
   \frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6 + x = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 6
   \]
   \[
   \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + y = 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -1
   \]

   The coordinates of the fourth vertex in this case are \((6, -1)\). However, this does not satisfy the condition \(x > 7\).

### Case 2: Diagonals are between \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\), and between \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\)

1. Calculate the midpoint of the diagonal between \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
   \[
   \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
   \]

2. Set the midpoint equal to the midpoint of the diagonal between \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\):
   \[
   \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
   \]

3. Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):
   \[
   \frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 7 + x = 11 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 + y = 11 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 7
   \]

   The coordinates of the fourth vertex in this case are \((4, 7)\). However, this does not satisfy the condition \(x > 7\).

### Case 3: Diagonals are between \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\), and between \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\)

1. Calculate the midpoint of the diagonal between \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
   \[
   \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
   \]

2. Set the midpoint equal to the midpoint of the diagonal between \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
   \[
   \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right) = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
   \]

3. Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):
   \[
   \frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5 + x = 13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 8
   \]
   \[
   \frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 + y = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 9
   \]

   The coordinates of the fourth vertex in this case are \((8, 9)\). This satisfies the condition \(x > 7\).

### Conclusion

The coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17
\]

\[
\boxed{17}

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can find the sum \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Multiplying through by \( xy \) to clear the denominators, we obtain

\[
4xy + 6y^2 = 6x^2 + 13xy \implies 6y^2 - 6x^2 = 9xy \implies 2y^2 - 2x^2 = 3xy \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{(-3x)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2x^2)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{25x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{8x}{4} = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-2x}{4} = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

We substitute these solutions back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. If \( y = 2x \), then

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. If \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \), then

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{4x^2 + x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 16, so the operator norm of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) is

\boxed{4}.

"To determine the value of \( Kaj = 1^{(2^{235423523})} \), we need to understand the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ 1^n = 1 \text{ for any integer } n. \]

In this problem, the exponent is \( 2^{235423523} \), which is a very large number. However, the base is still 1. Therefore, applying the property of exponents mentioned above, we get:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]
From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.
\]
Thus, the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**

   For \(58_9\):
   \[
   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}
   \]

   For \(18_9\):
   \[
   18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}

2. **Subtract the base 10 equivalents.**

   \[
   53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
   \]

3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

   To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
   \[
   36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0

   So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treekov are equal to one squig. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the given relationships:**
   - 10 treekov are equal to 3 squigs.
   - 2 treekov are equal to 1 squig.

2. **Verify the second relationship:**
   - According to the second relationship, 2 treekov are equal to 1 squig. This means that 1 squig is equivalent to 2 treekov.

3. **Reconcile the two relationships:**
   - We know from the first relationship that 10 treekov are equal to 3 squigs. We can use the second relationship to convert squigs to treekov.
   - Since 1 squig is equal to 2 treekov, 3 squigs would be equal to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) treekov.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, 10 treekov are equal to 6 treekov, which means there is an error in the problem statement or interpretation. Reiting the problem statement again.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^3\) term equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we start by analyzing the given information. The reservoir is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises by 4 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder multiplied by the height of the water added per hour.

The cross-sectional area \(A\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ A = \pi r^2 \]
where \(r\) is the radius of the cylinder. The height of the water added per hour is 4 meters. Therefore, the volume of water added per hour can also be expressed as:
\[ V = A \cdot h = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 = 4\pi r^2 \]

We know from the problem statement that the volume of water added per hour is \(20\pi\) cubic meters. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 4\pi r^2 = 20\pi \]

To solve for \(r^2\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\):
\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the cylindrical reservoir is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both regions defined by the piecewise function.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the quadratic part \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
- If \(a > 0\), the quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards.
- If \(a < 0\), the quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening downwards.
- If \(a = 0\), the quadratic function \(f(x) = 0\) is a horizontal line.

### Step 2: Analyze the linear part \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
- If \(a > 0\), the linear function \(ax + 2a\) is a line with a positive slope.
- If \(a < 0\), the linear function \(ax + 2a\) is a line with a negative slope.
- If \(a = 0\), the linear function \(f(x) = 0\) is a horizontal line.

### Step 3: Determine the intersection points with vertical lines
For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every vertical line at least once, the function must cover all real values of \(y\).

#### Case 1: \(a > 0\)
- For \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) = ax^2\) covers all values from \(a^3\) to \(\infty\).
- For \(x < a\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) covers all values from \(-\infty\) to \(a^2 + 2a\).

For \(f(x)\) to cover all real values, the range of \(f(x)\) must be \((-\infty, \infty)\). This requires:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \]

The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We test the intervals determined by these roots: \((- \infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
  \[ (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0 \]
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
  \[ (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \not\leq 0 \]
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
  \[ (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0 \]
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
  \[ (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \not\leq 0 \]

Thus, \(a\) must be in the interval \([-1, 2]\).

#### Case 2: \(a < 0\)
- For \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) = ax^2\) covers all values from \(a^3\) to \(\infty\).
- For \(x < a\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) covers all values from \(-\infty\) to \(a^2 + 2a\).

For \(f(x)\) to cover all real values, the range of \(f(x)\) must be \((-\infty, \infty)\). This requires:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \]

Since \(a < 0\), we only consider the intervals where \(a\) is negative. From the previous analysis, the valid interval is \([-1, 0)\).

### Case 3: \(a = 0\)
- For \(x \geq 0\), \(f(x) = 0\).
- For \(x < 0\), \(f(x) = 0\).

In this case, \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), so it does not cover all real values.

### Conclusion
The largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve for the values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the cubic equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) \right] + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda^2 - 1 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 \right] = 0.
\]
For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2) - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + 2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2 - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
0 + 0 - 2\lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-2\lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
We need to check if \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\) satisfies the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). For \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\), the function is:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x (1 - x) = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}.
\]
The fixed points are:
\[
f(x) = x \implies \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2} = x \implies -\frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x}{2} = 0 \implies -\frac{x(x + 1)}{2} = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } x = -1.
\]
Since \(x = -1\) is not in the interval \([0,1]\), the only fixed point is \(x = 0\). Now, we check \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f\left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(1 - \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{2}\right).
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2 - x + x^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} (x - x^2)(2 - x + x^2) = \frac{1}{4} (2x - x^2 - 2x^2 + x^3 + x^2 - x^4) = \frac{1}{4} (2x - 2x^2 + x^3 - x^4) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{4} - \frac{x^4}{4}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we need:
\[
x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{4} - \frac{x^4}{4} = x \implies -\frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{4} - \frac{x^4}{4} = 0 \implies -x^2 (1 - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{4}) = 0.
\]
This gives us:
\[
x^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 1 - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{4} = 0.
\]
The first solution is \(x = 0\). For the second equation, we solve:
\[
1 - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{4} = 0 \implies 4 - 2x + x^2 = 0 \implies (x - 1)^2 = 0 \implies x = 1.
\]
So, the solutions are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\). Since \(f(x) = x\) at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\), we need to check if there are any other solutions in the interval \([0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). We already know that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) but not to \(f(x) = x\). Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\).

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we can use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify \(\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ.
\]

Similarly, we use the sum-to-product identities to simplify \(\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = \sin 25^\circ - \sin(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = \sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Finally, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = \sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ\).

Thus, the expression becomes:

\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since all subsequent terms will also be 0, we sum the calculated values:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
f_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule, we get:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y)
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_x = \frac{(1 - y^2) - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Setting \( f_x = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
1 - y^2 - xy = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1 - y^2}{y}
\]

Similarly, we find the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):

\[
f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule again:

\[
f_y = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y) + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Simplifying the first term:

\[
f_y = -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Setting \( f_y = 0 \):

\[
-\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - x^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - y^2}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( 1 - y^2 \):

\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]

Subtracting \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides:

\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]

Thus:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. We now evaluate \( f(x, y) \) on this circle. Let \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \). Substituting these into \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta}
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \):

\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity again:

\[
\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\]

Thus, \( f(x, y) = 1 \) for all points \((x, y)\) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

Next, we check the boundary conditions where \( x = \pm 1 \) or \( y = \pm 1 \):

1. If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

2. If \( x = -1 \), then \( f(-1, y) = -1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(-1, 0) = -1 \).

3. If \( y = 1 \), then \( f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

4. If \( y = -1 \), then \( f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, -1) = -1 \).

From all these evaluations, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors originating from the same point. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), it creates two smaller triangles, \(\triangle AGM\) and \(\triangle AGN\), that are similar to \(\triangle ABC\) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of \(\triangle AGM\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distances from \(G\) to \(AB\) and from \(G\) to \(BC\). Since \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \(G\) to \(AB\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(C\) to \(AB\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of \(\triangle AGM\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of \(\triangle AGM\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144, the area of \(\triangle AGM\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AGM = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64
\]

Similarly, the area of \(\triangle AGN\) is also 64, because \(\triangle AGN\) is congruent to \(\triangle AGM\) (they have the same base \(AG\) and the same height from \(G\) to \(AC\)).

The area of quadrilateral \(AMGN\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle AGM\) and \(\triangle AGN\):
\[
\text{Area of } AMGN = 64 + 64 = 128

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle AGM\), \(\triangle AGN\), and \(\triangle GMN\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle GMN\) is:

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference.

Given:

\[a_8 = 500\]

We can express these terms using the general formula:
\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

2. **Adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator**: To convert the fraction into a decimal, we need the denominator to be a power of 10.

We can express the total value of the coins with the following equation:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all either 0 or 1, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must have at least two trailing zeros.

Next, we need to ensure that the remaining part of the number (after removing the trailing zeros) is a multiple of 2 and \(3^2 = 9\). Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the remaining part must be a binary number (a number in base 2) that is a multiple of 9. We will check the smallest binary numbers to find the smallest one that is a multiple of 9.

The smallest binary numbers are 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111, etc. We need to check each of these to see if they are multiples of 9.

- \(1_2 = 1_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(10_2 = 2_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(11_2 = 3_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(100_2 = 4_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(101_2 = 5_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(110_2 = 6_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(111_2 = 7_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(1000_2 = 8_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(1001_2 = 9_{10}\) (a multiple of 9)

Since \(1001_2 = 9_{10}\) is a multiple of 9, the smallest binary number that is a multiple of 9 is 1001. Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all either 0 or 1 is:

\[ 100100 \]

We can verify this by checking the prime factorization of 100100:

\[ 100100 = 1001 \times 100 = (7 \times 11 \times 13) \times (2^2 \times 5^2) = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \div 3 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

Since 100100 has the same prime factors as 450, it is indeed a multiple of 450. Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the probability that Kolo postavlja dama na osenčen kvadrat šahovnice, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of the two dice rolls and how they map to the squares of the chessboard.

First, let's consider the possible outcomes when the first die is rolled. The die has six faces, numbered 1 through 6. When we divide each number by 4, the possible remainders are:
- \(1 \div 4 = 0\) remainder \(1\)
- \(2 \div 4 = 0\) remainder \(2\)
- \(3 \div 4 = 0\) remainder \(3\)
- \(4 \div 4 = 1\) remainder \(0\)
- \(5 \div 4 = 1\) remainder \(1\)
- \(6 \div 4 = 1\) remainder \(2\)

So, the possible remainders are 0, 1, and 2. Since each number on the die is equally likely, the probability of each remainder is:
\[ P(\text{remainder } 0) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{remainder } 1) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{remainder } 2) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Next, let's consider the possible outcomes when the second die is rolled. The die has six faces, numbered 1 through 6. When we divide each number by 5, the possible remainders are:
- \(1 \div 5 = 0\) remainder \(1\)
- \(2 \div 5 = 0\) remainder \(2\)
- \(3 \div 5 = 0\) remainder \(3\)
- \(4 \div 5 = 0\) remainder \(4\)
- \(5 \div 5 = 1\) remainder \(0\)
- \(6 \div 5 = 1\) remainder \(1\)

So, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since each number on the die is equally likely, the probability of each remainder is:
\[ P(\text{remainder } 0) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{remainder } 1) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{remainder } 2) = \frac{1}{6} \]
\[ P(\text{remainder } 3) = \frac{1}{6} \]
\[ P(\text{remainder } 4) = \frac{1}{6} \]

Now, we need to find the probability that the remainder when the first die is divided by 4 is 1 (which corresponds to the second column) and the remainder when the second die is divided by 5 is 4 (which corresponds to the fifth row). The probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{remainder } 1 \text{ on first die and remainder } 4 \text{ on second die}) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{18} \]

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the double-angle identity that \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\), so \(\sin^2 40^\circ = 4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ\). Using the identity \(\sin^2 40^\circ + \cos^2 40^\circ = 1\), we can express \(\cos^2 40^\circ\) as \(1 - \sin^2 40^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of specific angles, which gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

"To determine the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis,
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane,
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

In other words, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\). This plane extends infinitely in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \(c\) in the \(z\)-direction.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[

\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015. \]

Next, we expand each term in the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[ (x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125, \]
\[ -49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225, \]
\[ 623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115. \]

Now, we combine all these expanded terms:

\[ g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) + (-49x^2 - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015. \]

We simplify by combining like terms:

\[ g(x) = x^3 + (15x^2 - 49x^2) + (75x - 490x + 623x) + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015). \]
\[ g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x + 0. \]
\[ g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x. \]

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\]

Since \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.

This implies that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.

   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(A\) be the measure of the missing interior angle. Therefore, the total sum of all interior angles is:

   \]

5. **Solve for \(A\):**
   Since \(A\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We can use this information to find \(n\).

6. **Isolate \(n\):**
   First, solve for \(A\):
   \[
   A = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Since \(A < 180^\circ\), we set up the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ

7. **Simplify the inequality:**
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}

   Calculate the division:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444\ldots
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444\ldots

8. **Determine the integer value of \(n\):**
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(n\) is 8.

9. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ

   The missing angle \(A\) is:
   \[
   A = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ

We find that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \).

Substitute \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \) back into the expression for \( t \):

"To determine the common surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic centimeter, we start by finding the side length of the cube. The volume \(V\) of a cube with side length \(s\) is given by the formula:

\[
V = s^3
\]

Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic centimeter, we can set up the equation:

\[

Solving for \(s\), we take the cube root of both sides:

\[
s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \text{ cm}

Next, we calculate the surface area \(A\) of the cube. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square with side length \(s\). The area of one face is:

\[

Since there are 6 faces, the total surface area is:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to determine what the radical conjugate is. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[

\[

"To determine the position of the number 2003 in the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
Substituting the values for \(a_1\) and \(d\) into the formula, we get:
\[
a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we have:
\[
a_n = 1 + 2n - 2
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
a_n = 2n - 1

We need to find the value of \(n\) for which \(a_n = 2003\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[

2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we need to determine the perpendicular distance between them. The direction vectors of the two lines are given by:

\[
\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the lines are parallel, \(\mathbf{d_2} = 2\mathbf{d_1}\). This confirms that the lines are indeed parallel. Next, we need a vector that connects a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can use the points \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) from the two lines. The vector \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}

The distance between the two parallel lines is the length of the projection of \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\) onto a vector that is perpendicular to \(\mathbf{d_1}\). This perpendicular distance can be found using the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d_1}\|}{\|\mathbf{d_1}\|}
\]

First, we calculate the cross product \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d_1}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d_1} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 8 & -7 & -5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-7)(-2) - (-5)(-9)) - \mathbf{j}((8)(-2) - (-5)(2)) + \mathbf{k}((8)(-9) - (-7)(2))

\[

\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d_1}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}

\[
\|\mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}

"To determine the number of integer-coordinate points strictly inside the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that lie within the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of any point strictly inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This gives us the possible integer values for \(x\) as \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are 9 such values.

\[

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}

\[

Applying these properties, we get:

Next, we distribute each cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a})

\[

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

"To find the average price of Juan's stamps from the 1970s, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s.
2. Determine the cost of stamps from each country.
3. Calculate the total cost of all stamps from the 1970s.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to find the average price.

From the table, we can see the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s:
- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

The cost of stamps from each country is:
- Brazil: 6 cents per stamp
- France: 6 cents per stamp
- Peru: 4 cents per stamp
- Spain: 5 cents per stamp

Now, we calculate the total cost for each country:
- Total cost for Brazil: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents/stamp} = 72 \text{ cents}\)
- Total cost for France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents/stamp} = 72 \text{ cents}\)
- Total cost for Peru: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cents/stamp} = 24 \text{ cents}\)
- Total cost for Spain: \(13 \text{ stamps} \times 5 \text{ cents/stamp} = 65 \text{ cents}\)

Next, we sum the total costs for all countries:
\[72 \text{ cents} + 72 \text{ cents} + 24 \text{ cents} + 65 \text{ cents} = 233 \text{ cents}\]

Now, we find the total number of stamps from the 1970s:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(AC\) as the hypotenuse and \(CD\) as one of the legs. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

We need to express \(d\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD}
\]
Let \(AB = x\). Then:
\[
\frac{x}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies x = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

Now, we use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \implies d^2 = x^2 + b^2
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{ab}{c}\) into the equation:
\[
d^2 = \left(\frac{ab}{c}\right)^2 + b^2 = \frac{a^2b^2}{c^2} + b^2 = b^2 \left(\frac{a^2}{c^2} + 1\right) = b^2 \left(\frac{a^2 + c^2}{c^2}\right) = \frac{b^2(a^2 + c^2)}{c^2}
\]
Thus,
\[
d = b \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + c^2}{c^2}} = b \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{c}
\]

Now, we substitute \(d\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times b \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{c} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \sqrt{a^2 + c^2}
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BC = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{ab}{c} \times b = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a b^2}{c}
\]

The total area of \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a b^2}{c} + \frac{1}{2} \times b \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = 42
\]

We need to find the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) to \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \times b \sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a b^2}{c}} = \frac{b \sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{\frac{a b^2}{c}} = \frac{b \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} \times c}{a b^2} = \frac{c \sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{a b}
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are in the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides \(BC\) and \(AD\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

Thus,
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c \sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{a b}
\]

Given that \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of \(ABCD\):
\[

Next, perform the multiplication:

So the expression becomes:

So the fraction is:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle. This means that if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, they must alternate: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), or any cyclic permutation of these.

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points divided by 4 (since rotating the circle does not create a new arrangement). This is:

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: As mentioned, the favorable arrangements are those where the points alternate. There are 2 such arrangements: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Therefore, there are 2 favorable arrangements.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the combined area of the two segments of the circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

According to the problem, the combined area of the two segments is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to express the area of the segments in terms of the angle \(\theta = \angle ADC\).

### Area of the Segment in the Larger Circle
The area of a segment in a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of a segment} = \text{Area of the sector} - \text{Area of the triangle}
\]

For the larger circle with radius \(2\):
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
\]

The area of the triangle in the larger circle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and the included angle:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)
\]

Thus, the area of the segment in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment in the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)
\]

### Area of the Segment in the Smaller Circle
For the smaller circle with radius \(1\):
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The area of the triangle in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

Thus, the area of the segment in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment in the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

### Combined Area of the Two Segments
The combined area of the two segments is:
\[
(2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)) + \left(\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)\right) = 2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} - 2\sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]
\[
= \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{4\sin(\theta)}{2} - \frac{\sin(\theta)}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{5\sin(\theta)}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{5}{2}(\theta - \sin(\theta))
\]

We know this combined area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{5}{2}(\theta - \sin(\theta)) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Divide both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we need to find an angle \(\theta\) such that \(\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{\pi}{3}\). By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

Finally, convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 120^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical vases are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical vase and the spherical reservoir and then find out how many times the volume of the cylindrical vase fits into the volume of the spherical reservoir.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical vase. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical vase, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical reservoir, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times the volume of the cylindrical vase fits into the volume of the spherical reservoir. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical reservoir by the volume of the cylindrical vase:
\[ \text{Number of vases} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical vases needed to fill the spherical reservoir is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are angles in the interval \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\). Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta).
\]
This expression is a difference of squares:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2.
\]
We know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\), and similarly, \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = (0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - (\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5)^2 = \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}.
\]
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100, so we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[
\frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -0.09.

Thus, the value is \(\boxed{-0.09}\).","[-0.0900000000000000, '-0.09']",\frac{9}{100},"[9/100, '\\frac{9}{100}']",False
"To determine the speed of Kolo's pot in palces per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the speed from centimeters per minute to centimeters per second:**
   Kolo potives at a rate of 20 cm per minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert this speed to centimeters per second by dividing by 60:
   \[
   \text{Speed in cm/s} = \frac{20 \text{ cm/min}}{60 \text{ s/min}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cm/s}
   \]

2. **Convert the speed from centimeters per second to palces per second:**
   We know that 1 palce is equal to 2.54 cm. Therefore, to convert the speed from centimeters per second to palces per second, we divide by 2.54:
   \[
   \text{Speed in palces/s} = \frac{\frac{1}{3} \text{ cm/s}}{2.54 \text{ cm/palce}} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2.54} = \frac{1}{7.62} \text{ palces/s}

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a group of 8 republikancev and 6 demokratov, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each stratum (republikancev and demokratov), we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of republikancev or only of demokratov).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 people (8 republikancev and 6 demokratov). This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that consists only of republikancev. This is given by \(\binom{8}{5}\):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that consists only of demokratov. This is given by \(\binom{6}{5}\):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that does not meet the condition (i.e., consists only of republikancev or only of demokratov) is the sum of the two values calculated above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members to get the number of ways to form a subcommittee that includes at least one member from each stratum:

\[
2002 - 62 = 1940

Thus, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members, with at least one member from each stratum, is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

"Given that the product of three consecutive integers is 120, and when this product is divided by their average, the result is 24, we need to find the largest of these three integers.

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we write the equation for their product:
\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

Next, we find the average of these three integers:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product divided by the average is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24

We recognize that \( (n-1) \cdot (n+1) \) is a difference of squares:
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24

Add 1 to both sides to solve for \( n^2 \):
\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Take the square root of both sides:
\[

\]

Since we are looking for positive integers, we take \( n = 5 \).

The three consecutive integers are:
\[
n-1 = 4, \quad n = 5, \quad n+1 = 6

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. To do this, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.

This product includes \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\).

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we know that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

The coordinates of the points can be set as follows: \(A = (0, 11)\), \(B = (-x, 0)\), \(C = (x, 0)\), and \(D = (0, 1)\) since \(AD = 10\) and \(D\) is on \(AM\).

We are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). First, we find \(\angle BAC\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle BAC = 2\angle BAM\). Using the tangent function in \(\triangle ABM\), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BAM = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}
\]
Thus,
\[
\angle BAC = 2\arctan\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)
\]

Next, we find \(\angle BDC\). Using the coordinates of \(B\), \(D\), and \(C\), we can use the distance formula to find the lengths \(BD\) and \(DC\):
\[
BD = \sqrt{(0 - (-x))^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}
\]
\[
DC = \sqrt{(0 - x)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}
\]
Since \(BD = DC\), \(\triangle BDC\) is isosceles with \(\angle BDC = 180^\circ - 2\angle BDM\). Using the tangent function in \(\triangle BDM\), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1}
\]
Thus,
\[
\angle BDC = 180^\circ - 2\arctan(x)
\]

We are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), so:
\[
180^\circ - 2\arctan(x) = 3 \cdot 2\arctan\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
180^\circ - 2\arctan(x) = 6\arctan\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
180^\circ = 2\arctan(x) + 6\arctan\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)
\]
Dividing through by 2, we get:
\[
90^\circ = \arctan(x) + 3\arctan\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)
\]
Let \(\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)\). Then \(\arctan(x) = 90^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the tangent addition formula, we have:
\[
\tan(90^\circ - 3\theta) = \cot(3\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)}
\]
Since \(\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}\) and \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{x}{11}\), we get:
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right) - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{3x \cdot 121 - x^3}{1331}}{\frac{121 - 3x^2}{121}} = \frac{363x - x^3}{1331} \cdot \frac{121}{121 - 3x^2} = \frac{363x - x^3}{11(121 - 3x^2)}
\]
Thus,
\[
\cot(3\theta) = \frac{11(121 - 3x^2)}{363x - x^3} = \frac{121 - 3x^2}{33x - x^2}
\]
Since \(\tan(90^\circ - 3\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)}\), we have:
\[
\frac{121 - 3x^2}{33x - x^2} = \frac{11}{x}
\]
Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
x(121 - 3x^2) = 11(33x - x^2)
\]
Expanding both sides, we have:
\[
121x - 3x^3 = 363x - 11x^2
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
3x^3 - 11x^2 + 242x = 0
\]
Factoring out \(x\), we get:
\[
x(3x^2 - 11x + 242) = 0
\]
Since \(x \neq 0\), we solve the quadratic equation \(3x^2 - 11x + 242 = 0\). The discriminant is:
\[
(-11)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 242 = 121 - 2904 = -2783

"To find the median of 27 positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate \(3^7\):**
   \[
   3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187
   \]

2. **Understand the median:**
   The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. For a set with an odd number of elements, the median is the element at position \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements.

3. **Determine the position of the median:**
   Since there are 27 numbers, the median is at position:
   \[
   \frac{27+1}{2} = 14
   \]

4. **Consider the properties of the numbers:**
   The sum of the 27 numbers is 2187. To minimize the median, we should try to make the first 13 numbers as small as possible. The smallest positive integer is 1.

5. **Calculate the sum of the first 13 numbers:**
   \[
   13 \times 1 = 13
   \]

6. **Determine the sum of the remaining 14 numbers:**
   \[
   2187 - 13 = 2174
   \]

7. **Distribute the remaining sum among the last 14 numbers:**
   To minimize the median, we should try to make the 14th number as small as possible. If we assume the 14th number is \(x\), then the sum of the remaining 13 numbers must be \(2174 - x\).

8. **Set up the inequality:**
   Since each of the remaining 13 numbers must be at least \(x\), we have:
   \[
   13x \leq 2174 - x
   \]

9. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   14x \leq 2174
   \]
   \[
   x \leq \frac{2174}{14}
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 155.2857
   \]

   Since \(x\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(x\) is 155.

10. **Verify the distribution:**
    If \(x = 155\), then the sum of the remaining 13 numbers is:
    \[
    2174 - 155 = 2019
    \]
    Since \(13 \times 155 = 2015\), we need to adjust one of the numbers to make the sum exactly 2019. We can increase one of the numbers by 4 to make the sum 2019.

11. **Final distribution:**
    The first 13 numbers are 1, the 14th number is 155, and the remaining 13 numbers are 155 + 4 = 159.

Thus, the median of the 27 numbers is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\).

Since \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) and \(-4 < 0\), the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factorize the quadratic equation:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -7 \]
\[ y - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(y\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \).

- For \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is true in the interval \( (-\infty, 3) \).

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is false in the interval \( (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:

\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we convert back to \(x\):

\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answer

Combining the solutions from both parts, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of two variables taken one at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which row has the ratio of the number of male bus riders to the number of female bus riders closest to \(135\%\), we need to calculate the ratio for each row and compare it to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus riders for each row:

1. **9th row:**
   - Male bus riders: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Female bus riders: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.042\)

2. **10th row:**
   - Male bus riders: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Female bus riders: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.040\)

3. **11th row:**
   - Male bus riders: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Female bus riders: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

4. **12th row:**
   - Male bus riders: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Female bus riders: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.344\)

Now, let's compare each ratio to \(1.35\):

- 9th row: \(1.042\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.042 = 0.308\))
- 10th row: \(1.040\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.040 = 0.310\))
- 11th row: \(1.5\) (difference: \(1.5 - 1.35 = 0.15\))
- 12th row: \(1.344\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.344 = 0.006\))

The smallest difference is \(0.006\), which corresponds to the 12th row.

Therefore, the row with the number of male bus riders closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders is the \(\boxed{12}\)th row.","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is equal to \((x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x-9)(x+9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \((x-9)(x+9)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so \(x(x-36) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).

We need to find the intervals where the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative. We will consider each case for the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 < 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 > 0\), the quotient is positive.

We also need to check the points where the numerator or the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), and the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track is composed of two rectangular segments and two semicircular segments, and the total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangular field by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The two rectangular segments each have a length \( l \), and the two semicircular segments each have a radius \( w/2 \). The circumference of a full circle with radius \( w/2 \) is \( \pi w \), so the circumference of each semicircle is \( \frac{\pi w}{2} \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two rectangular segments and the circumferences of the two semicircular segments:
\[
2l + 2 \left( \frac{\pi w}{2} \right) = 2l + \pi w = 400
\]
We can solve this equation for \( l \):
\[
2l = 400 - \pi w
\]
\[
l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = l \cdot w = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2} \right) w = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0
\]
Solving for \( w \):
\[
\pi w = 200

Next, we substitute \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( l \):
\[
l = 200 - \frac{\pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = 200 - \frac{200}{2} = 200 - 100 = 100

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[
\frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
\[
ST = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(ST\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Recall the definition of the sine function for \(\angle T\):
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) as a function of \(x\). The distance formula gives us:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expanding \((x^2 - 3)^2\), we get:

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substituting this back into the expression for \(d\), we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0 \implies 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

In this form, \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces. The vertices can be arranged in such a way that they form two pyramids with a square base, and the distance between any two opposite vertices (the vertices of the square base of each pyramid) is the same.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) such that \(A, C, E\) are on one pyramid and \(B, D, F\) are on the other pyramid. The distance between any two opposite vertices is the same, and we can use this property to find the distance from point \(P\) to the sixth vertex.

Given the distances from point \(P\) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex as \(x\).

In a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This is a known geometric property. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:

\[
3^2 = 9
\]
\[
7^2 = 49
\]
\[
8^2 = 64
\]
\[
9^2 = 81
\]
\[
11^2 = 121
\]

Adding these values together:

\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant, we need to find the value of this constant. However, we can use the symmetry and properties of the octahedron to deduce that the distances must be symmetric around the center. Therefore, the distances to the vertices must be such that they form pairs with equal sums.

Given the distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we can pair them such that the sum of each pair is equal to the sum of the distances to the opposite vertices. Let's assume the pairs are:

\[
(3, 11), (7, 9), (8, x)
\]

The sum of each pair should be equal. Let's check:

\[
3 + 11 = 14
\]
\[
7 + 9 = 16
\]

Since the sum of the distances to the opposite vertices is the same, we need to find \(x\) such that:

\[
8 + x = 16
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 16 - 8

\[
x = 8

Therefore, the distance from point \(P\) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jenine's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jenine wants to apply the same force to both the softball and the baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for each object, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We know the masses of the softball and the baseball are 200 g and 150 g, respectively. Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). We can use the substitution \(y = x + \frac{1}{x}\) to simplify the equation. First, we express \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\) in terms of \(y\).

Multiply both sides of the equation \(y = x + \frac{1}{x}\) by \(x^2\):
\[x^4 + yx^2 + 1 = 0.\]
This implies:
\[x^4 + 1 = -yx^2.\]
Substitute \(x^4 + 1 = -yx^2\) into the original equation:
\[x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = -yx^2 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0.\]
Rearrange the terms:
\[2x^3 - yx^2 + 2 = 0.\]
Now, we need to find the values of \(y\) that satisfy this equation. Notice that if \(x\) is a root, then \(\frac{1}{x}\) is also a root. Therefore, the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) can be written as \(x, \frac{1}{x}, \omega x, \frac{1}{\omega x}\), where \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity, i.e., \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\).

The roots of the polynomial are:
\[x, \frac{1}{x}, \omega x, \frac{1}{\omega x}.\]
We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Without loss of generality, let \(\alpha_1 = x\), \(\alpha_2 = \frac{1}{x}\), \(\alpha_3 = \omega x\), and \(\alpha_4 = \frac{1}{\omega x}\). Then:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = x \cdot \frac{1}{x} + \omega x \cdot \frac{1}{\omega x} = 1 + 1 = 2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = x \cdot \omega x + \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{\omega x} = \omega x^2 + \frac{1}{\omega x^2} = \omega x^2 + \frac{1}{\omega} \cdot \frac{1}{x^2} = \omega x^2 + \omega^2 \cdot \frac{1}{x^2} = \omega x^2 + \omega^2 x^{-2}.
\]
Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\). Therefore:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \omega x^2 + (-1 - \omega) x^{-2} = \omega x^2 - x^{-2} - \omega x^{-2} = -x^{-2} + (\omega - \omega) x^2 = -x^{-2} - x^2.
\]
Similarly,
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = x \cdot \frac{1}{\omega x} + \frac{1}{x} \cdot \omega x = \frac{1}{\omega} + \omega = \omega^2 + \omega = -1.
\]
Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:
\[
\{2, -x^2 - x^{-2}, -1\}.
\]
Since \(x^2 + x^{-2} = (x + \frac{1}{x})^2 - 2 = y^2 - 2\), and \(y\) can take the values \(\pm \sqrt{-2} = \pm i\sqrt{2}\), we have:
\[

Therefore, \(-x^2 - x^{-2} = -(-4) = 4\). The set is:

"To determine the cost of one svinčik in cents, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the cost of one svinčik in dollars.
- Let \( y \) be the cost of one radirka in dollars.

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 3x + y = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5x + y = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 5x + y - 3x - y = 0.58 \]
\[ 2x = 0.58 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.58}{2} \]
\[ x = 0.29 \]

So, the cost of one svinčik is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.29 \times 100 = 29 \]

Therefore, the cost of one svinčik in cents is \(\boxed{29}\).","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True
"To determine the last non-zero digit on the right side of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction to its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\). To do this, we can use long division.

1. **Set up the division:**
   \[
   137 \div 500
   \]

2. **Since 137 is less than 500, we add a decimal point and a zero to make it 1370:**
   \[
   1370 \div 500
   \]

3. **Divide 1370 by 500:**
   \[
   1370 \div 500 = 2.74
   \]

Thus, the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:
\[

Now, we identify the last non-zero digit on the right side of the decimal point in \(0.274\). The digits are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit is 4.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit on the right side of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) inside the rectangle \( ABCD \) is closer to the center \( O \) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \( ABCD \) in the coordinate plane with \( O \) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \( AB = a \) and \( AD = b \). Without loss of generality, we can set \( a = k \cdot b \). The coordinates of the vertices are:
- \( A = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}) = (-\frac{kb}{2}, \frac{b}{2}) \)
- \( B = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}) = (\frac{kb}{2}, \frac{b}{2}) \)
- \( C = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}) = (\frac{kb}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}) \)
- \( D = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}) = (-\frac{kb}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}) \)

The condition that a point \( P = (x, y) \) is closer to \( O \) than to any vertex can be expressed using the Euclidean distance formula. The distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \( P \) to vertex \( A \) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{kb}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

For \( P \) to be closer to \( O \) than to \( A \), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{kb}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x + \frac{kb}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + kbx + \frac{k^2b^2}{4} + y^2 - yb + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Subtracting \( x^2 + y^2 \) from both sides:
\[
0 < kbx + \frac{k^2b^2}{4} - yb + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
kbx - yb < -\frac{k^2b^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Factoring out \( b \) on the left-hand side:
\[
b(kx - y) < -\frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( b \) (assuming \( b \neq 0 \)):
\[
kx - y < -\frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{4b}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
kx - y < -\frac{k^2 + 1}{4}
\]

This inequality represents a half-plane. Similarly, we can derive inequalities for the other vertices:
1. \( kx + y < -\frac{k^2 + 1}{4} \)
2. \( -kx + y < -\frac{k^2 + 1}{4} \)
3. \( -kx - y < -\frac{k^2 + 1}{4} \)

These inequalities define four half-planes that intersect to form a smaller square centered at \( O \) with side length \( \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2b} = \frac{k^2 + 1}{2k} \).

The area of this smaller square is:
\[
\left(\frac{k^2 + 1}{2k}\right)^2 = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}
\]

The area of the original rectangle \( ABCD \) is:
\[
a \cdot b = kb \cdot b = kb^2
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) is closer to \( O \) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{\frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}}{kb^2} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2 \cdot kb^2} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^3b^2}
\]

Since \( b^2 \) cancels out:
\[
\frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^3}
\]

Thus, the probability is:

\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
This division is exact, meaning that 54 is exactly 9 times 6 with no remainder. Therefore, the remainder is 0.

We can also verify this by expressing 54 in terms of 6:

Here, 6 times 9 is 54, and the remainder is 0.

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

3. Determine the difference between the initial total and the total afterprodifying, which will give us the denar left.

First, let's calculate the total amount of denar they have initially:

\]

Adding these amounts step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70

\[

\[

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7

To verify, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

Here, the length \(l\) is 400 cm and the width \(w\) is 300 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we substitute \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.

We can simplify the denominator using the fact that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), which implies \(1 + \omega = -\omega^2\):

\[
\frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(-\omega^2)} = \frac{-1}{-\omega^3} = \frac{-1}{-1} = 1.
