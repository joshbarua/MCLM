"To find the length of \(DE\), we start by analyzing the given right triangle \(DEF\). We know that \(\angle DEF = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this triangle, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]

We are given that \(EF = 7\). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:

\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In triangle \(DEF\), we have:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:

\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the value of \( w \), we need to rotate the complex number \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians in the counterclockwise direction around the complex number \( c \). This can be done using the formula for rotation of a complex number around another complex number.

First, we express the rotation as a transformation in the complex plane. If we want to rotate a complex number \( z \) by an angle \( \theta \) around a point \( c \), we can use the formula:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), and we are rotating by \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). The exponential form of \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) is \( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

First, we find \( z - c \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Next, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Finally, we add this result to \( c \):
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the value of \( w \) is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a circular table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of ways is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[

Now, we need to find the product of these congruences modulo 7:

Next, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[

\[

"Given a right-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). We need to find the value of \(\tan A\).

\]
We are given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). Substituting this into the tangent formula, we get:
\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]
Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\angle A\) is an acute angle in a right-angled triangle), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}\), we need to analyze the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. The denominator of the function is \(x^2 - 5x - 14\). We need to factorize this quadratic expression:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
\]

So, the function can be rewritten as:

\[
f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}
\]

The vertical asymptotes occur at the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, which are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). Therefore, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote. Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). Therefore, \(c = 0\).

Now, we need to find the value of \(a + b + c\):

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, but with a slight modification. Instead of \(99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 \cdot 1 + 1^2\), we have \(99^2 + 99 + 1\). However, we can still use a similar approach by recognizing that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

To see why this is true, consider the polynomial \(x^3 - 1\). This polynomial can be factored as:
\[x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2 + x + 1).\]

If we let \(x = 100\), then we have:
\[100^3 - 1 = (100-1)(100^2 + 100 + 1) = 99 \cdot (100^2 + 100 + 1).\]

Solving for \(100^2 + 100 + 1\), we get:
\[100^2 + 100 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

Now, we need to calculate \(100^3 - 1\):
\[100^3 = 1000000,\]
\[1000000 - 1 = 999999.\]

So, we have:
\[100^2 + 100 + 1 = \frac{999999}{99}.\]

Finally, we perform the division:
\[999999 \div 99 = 10101.\]

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for every two-dimensional vector \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

First, let's express \( A \bold{v} \) for a general vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[

\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4 + 13)(x^2 + y^2) = 17.

Thus, the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) is \(\sqrt{17}\), and the operator norm of \( A \) is

\|A\| = \sqrt{17}.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Finally, we recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"Let's define the variables for the weights of the treek, squig, and goolee. Let \( t \) be the weight of a treek, \( s \) be the weight of a squig, and \( g \) be the weight of a goolee.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Tíz treek annyit nyom, mint három squig és egy goolee.
2. Két treek és egy goolee súlya egyenlő egy squig súlyával.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ 10t = 3s + g \]

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ 2t + g = s \]

We need to find the value of \( t \) in terms of \( s \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = s - 2t \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[ 10t = 3s + (s - 2t) \]
\[ 10t = 4s - 2t \]
\[ 12t = 4s \]
\[ t = \frac{4s}{12} \]
\[ t = \frac{s}{3} \]

So, the weight of a treek is \( \frac{s}{3} \). This means that the weight of three treeks is:
\[ 3t = 3 \left( \frac{s}{3} \right) = s \]

Therefore, three treeks súlya egyenlő egy squig súlyával. The answer is:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

Now, we perform each multiplication:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expanded form must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. For \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12

2. For \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. For \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. For \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. For the constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

First, solve for \(a\) from the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the equation for \(t^2\) to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is correct.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the equation for \(t\) to verify:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This is correct.

Since all equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, we find \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the rate at which the volume of water in the tank changes. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. According to the problem, the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is:

\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

We can use the chain rule to relate the rates of change of \( V \) and \( h \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Since \( V = \pi r^2 h \), we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting this into the chain rule equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to find \( r \):

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) for which the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both regions defined by the piecewise function.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the quadratic part \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
- If \(a > 0\), the quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards.
- If \(a < 0\), the quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening downwards.
- If \(a = 0\), the quadratic function \(f(x) = 0\) is a horizontal line.

For \(x \geq a\), the minimum value of \(f(x) = ax^2\) occurs at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

### Step 2: Analyze the linear part \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
- If \(a > 0\), the linear function \(ax + 2a\) is increasing.
- If \(a < 0\), the linear function \(ax + 2a\) is decreasing.
- If \(a = 0\), the linear function \(f(x) = 0\) is a horizontal line.

For \(x < a\), as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the range of \(f(x)\)
- If \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) is \([a^3, \infty)\).
- If \(a < 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a]\).
- If \(a = 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) is \(\{0\}\).

### Step 4: Ensure every vertical line intersects the graph
For every vertical line to intersect the graph of \(y = f(x)\), the range of \(f(x)\) must cover all real numbers. This means the range must be \((-\infty, \infty)\).

- For \(a > 0\), the range is \([a^3, \infty)\), which does not cover all real numbers.
- For \(a < 0\), the range is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a]\). For this to cover all real numbers, \(a^2 + 2a\) must be \(\infty\), which is not possible since \(a^2 + 2a\) is a finite number.
- For \(a = 0\), the range is \(\{0\}\), which does not cover all real numbers.

However, we need to check if there is a value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) can cover all real numbers by considering the behavior at the boundary \(x = a\).

### Step 5: Check the continuity at \(x = a\)
For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x). \]

From the piecewise function:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a^2 + 2a, \]
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

Setting these equal:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]

Rearrange the equation:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

Factor out \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

Factor the quadratic:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]

The solutions are:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

### Step 6: Determine the largest value of \(a\)
From the analysis, \(a = 0\) does not cover all real numbers. We need to check \(a = 2\) and \(a = -1\).

- For \(a = 2\):
  - The quadratic part \(f(x) = 2x^2\) for \(x \geq 2\) has a minimum value of \(2^3 = 8\).
  - The linear part \(f(x) = 2x + 4\) for \(x < 2\) has a range of \((-\infty, 2 \cdot 2 + 4] = (-\infty, 8]\).
  - The function is continuous at \(x = 2\) and covers all real numbers.

- For \(a = -1\):
  - The quadratic part \(f(x) = -x^2\) for \(x \geq -1\) has a minimum value of \((-1)^3 = -1\).
  - The linear part \(f(x) = -x - 2\) for \(x < -1\) has a range of \((-\infty, -(-1) - 2] = (-\infty, -1]\).
  - The function is continuous at \(x = -1\) and does not cover all real numbers.

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with radius 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\) and solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To determine the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the cubic equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) \right] + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda^2 - 1 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 \right] = 0.
\]
For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2) - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,

\[
-\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + 2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2 - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,

\[
0 + 0 - 2\lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-2\lambda + 1 = 0,

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\).

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]

By symmetry and trigonometric properties, we find that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \tan 35^\circ.

The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 8 letters where the letter E appears 4 times, the letter L appears 2 times, and the letters I and P each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- \( n = 8 \) (total letters)
- \( n_1 = 4 \) (for E)
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (for L)
- \( n_3 = 1 \) (for I)
- \( n_4 = 1 \) (for P)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). The function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We evaluate \( f(x, x) \) at these critical points:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1. \]
The maximum value of \( f(x, x) \) is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points inside the region \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) that could give a value greater than 1. However, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le (x^2 + y^2)(1 - y^2 + 1 - x^2) = (x^2 + y^2)(2 - x^2 - y^2). \]
Let \( u = x^2 + y^2 \). Then \( 0 \le u \le 2 \), and the inequality becomes:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le u(2 - u) = -u^2 + 2u. \]
The maximum value of the quadratic function \( -u^2 + 2u \) occurs at \( u = 1 \), and it is:
\[ -1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 1. \]
Therefore, \( (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le 1 \), which implies \( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \le 1 \).

Thus, the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\|
\]

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component:

\[
\mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Finally, we calculate the area of the triangle:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \( z \) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{i\cdot17\pi} = e^{i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{i\pi} = (e^{i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{-i\pi} = (e^{-i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To determine the area of the triangle \( ENG \), we start by noting that \( G \) is the centroid of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through the centroid \( G \), it divides triangle \( ABC \) into two smaller triangles, \( AMN \) and \( ABC \), with a similarity ratio of 2:3 (because the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, and \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and half the distance from \( A \) to \( BC \) along the median).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:

Given that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:

The area of triangle \( ENG \) is the area of triangle \( AMN \) minus the area of triangle \( AEG \). Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides triangle \( AMN \) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \( AEG \) is:

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a terminating decimal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the denominator**: The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\). We can rewrite this as \(4 \cdot 78125\), but it is more useful to keep it in its prime factorized form for now.

2. **Adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator**: To convert the fraction into a decimal, we need the denominator to be a power of 10. The prime factorization of 10 is \(2 \cdot 5\).

First, let's consider the divisibility by 50. A number is divisible by 50 if its last two digits are either 00 or 50.

Next, let's consider the divisibility by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since \( N = 100M \), the sum of the digits of \( N \) is the same as the sum of the digits of \( M \).

   - When the second number is divided by 5, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 0.
   - The remainder 0 corresponds to the fifth row of the chessboard.
   - The remainders 1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond to the first, second, third, and fourth rows of the chessboard.

3. **Determine the condition for the baba to step on a shaded square:**
   - The baba steps on a shaded square if and only if the column number (first remainder) is 4 (the fourth column) and the row number (second remainder) is 5 (the fifth row).

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability that the first number leaves a remainder of 0 (i.e., the baba steps on the fourth column) is \(\frac{1}{4}\).
   - The probability that the second number leaves a remainder of 0 (i.e., the baba steps on the fifth row) is \(\frac{1}{5}\).
   - Since the two events are independent, the probability that both events occur (i.e., the baba steps on the shaded square) is the product of their individual probabilities:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20}

Therefore, the probability that the baba steps on a shaded square is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}\).","[1/20, '\\frac{1}{20}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To determine the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Thus, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Therefore, the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

"To determine the shape of the surface described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) represents the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis, \(\theta\) represents the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, and \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane. The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is constant for all points on the surface. This describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

"To find the smallest possible angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by determining the roots of \( g(x) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we have:

\[ g(x) = 0 \implies f(x + 5) = 0. \]

This means that the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( x + 5 \) is a root of \( f(x) \). If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15. \]

Next, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by:

\[ -\frac{a_2}{a_3}. \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have \( a_3 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = -49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Substituting this back into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:

\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We can use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = 3 + 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

However, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). Using the identity again for the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 20^\circ}\right)\). Simplifying this expression, we find that \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\). Therefore:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 3 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 3 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{11}{3}.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles, excluding one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles, excluding one, is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(S\) be the total sum of the interior angles. Then:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ

3. **Express the total sum \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for the excluded angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the excluded angle must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\).

5. **Set up the inequality:**
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444

   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444

   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:

   n \leq 8

   From both parts of the inequality, we find:

This simplifies to:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test values of \( x \) to find a solution. Testing \( x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \), we find:

\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution, and thus \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4, \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = -6 \). To convert \(-6\) to a positive integer modulo 23, we add 23:
\[ -6 + 23 = 17. \]
Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:
\[ \boxed{17}. \]
To verify, we check that \( t+2 = 19 \) is the inverse of \( t = 17 \) modulo 23:
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323. \]
Since \( 323 \div 23 = 14 \) with a remainder of 1, we have:
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Therefore, \( t = 17 \) is indeed the correct solution.","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True

2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Multiply the area of one face by 6 to get the total surface area of the cube.

First, let's find the side length of the cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know that the volume is 1 cubic meter, so we can set up the equation:

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:
\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]
where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
Simplifying the components, we get:
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product \(\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Then, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Thus, the distance between the two lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle.

The rectangle spans from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). However, since we are looking for points strictly inside the rectangle, the \(x\)-coordinates must satisfy \(-5 < x < 5\) and the \(y\)-coordinates must satisfy \(-4 < y < 4\).

Let's count the number of integer values for \(x\) that satisfy \(-5 < x < 5\). The possible integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us 9 possible values for \(x\).

Next, let's count the number of integer values for \(y\) that satisfy \(-4 < y < 4\). The possible integer values for \(y\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). This gives us 7 possible values for \(y\).

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible \(x\)-values by the number of possible \(y\)-values:
\[
9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Therefore, the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangle is \(\boxed{63}\).","[63, '63']",63,"[63, '63']",True
"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

Substituting these back into our expression, we get:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

   - Spain: 13 stamps

2. **Determine the cost per stamp for each country:**

   - France: \( 12 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cents per stamp} = 48 \text{ cents} \)

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is equal to \(CD = c\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of the trapezoid can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times (a + b) = 42
\]
This confirms our earlier equation \((a + b) \times c = 84\).

Now, we can find the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

From the equation \((a + b) \times c = 84\), we can express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) and \(c\):
\[
a + b = \frac{84}{c} \implies a = \frac{84}{c} - b
\]

Substituting \(a\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \left( \frac{84}{c} - b \right) \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times (84 - b \times c)
\]

Since \(b \times c\) is the area of \(\triangle ABC\), and the total area of the trapezoid is 42, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = 42 - [\triangle ACD]
\]
Substituting \(b \times c\) with \(2 \times [\triangle ABC]\):
\[
b \times c = 2 \times (42 - [\triangle ACD])
\]

Substituting this back into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (84 - 2 \times (42 - [\triangle ACD])) = \frac{1}{2} \times (84 - 84 + 2 \times [\triangle ACD]) = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times [\triangle ACD] = [\triangle ACD]
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 21

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

   Simplify:
   \[

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19}

   Simplify:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}}
   \]
   Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{19} \cdot \frac{19}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

Substitute these values into the operation formula:
\[

\]

First, calculate the product of \(m\) and \(p\):
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]

Next, simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 21 and 30 is 3:
\[

Simplify the multiplication:
\[

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one segment's endpoints are on opposite sides of the other segment. This means that if we arrange the four points in a clockwise order, the points must alternate between the two segments.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (for rotations) and by 2 (for reflections), giving us:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   distinct arrangements of the points. But since we are considering the probability, we need to consider all possible pairings of the points into two segments, which means we need to consider all permutations of the points without dividing by the symmetries of the circle. So, we have \(4!\) total arrangements.

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: For the segments to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern. There are 2 such patterns for any given set of 4 points (e.g., \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\)). Therefore, there are \(2 \times 3 = 6\) favorable arrangements (since there are 3 ways to choose which point is first in the clockwise order).

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Since there are 24 total arrangements and 6 favorable arrangements, the probability is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the shaded area (the area of the smaller circle minus the area of the overlapping region) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
\]

According to the problem, the shaded area is:
\[
\text{Shaded area} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded area is the area of the smaller circle minus the area of the overlapping region. The area of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times (1)^2 = \pi
\]

Let the area of the overlapping region be \(A\). Then:
\[
\text{Shaded area} = \pi - A
\]

Setting this equal to the given shaded area, we get:
\[
\pi - A = \frac{5\pi}{3}

\[
A = \pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{3\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = -\frac{2\pi}{3}

"To determine how many cylindrical pohars are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylinder and the sphere and then find out how many times the volume of the cylinder fits into the volume of the sphere.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical pohar. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical pohar, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in this value, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times the volume of the cylindrical pohar fits into the volume of the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:
\[ \text{Number of pohars} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical pohars needed to fill the spherical tank is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then the expression becomes \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = (0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - (\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100:
\[
\frac{3}{25} = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{25 \cdot 4} = \frac{12}{100}
\]
\[
\frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression is:

"To determine the speed of the cylinder in meters per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of the cylinder in meters per minute.
2. Convert the speed from meters per minute to meters per second.

Given:
- The speed of the cylinder is 20 meters per minute.

We know that there are 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, to convert the speed from meters per minute to meters per second, we divide the speed by 60.

\[
\text{Speed in meters per second} = \frac{20 \text{ meters per minute}}{60 \text{ seconds per minute}} = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ meters per second}

Thus, the speed of the cylinder in meters per second is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member business group from 8 republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that at least one tag is from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the group and then subtracting the number of ways to form a group that does not meet the condition (i.e., a group with only republicans or only Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member group from 14 people (8 republicans and 6 Democrats):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member group that consists only of republicans. Since there are 8 republicans, the number of ways to choose 5 out of 8 is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member group that consists only of Democrats. Since there are 6 Democrats, the number of ways to choose 5 out of 6 is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6
\]

Now, subtract the number of ways to form a group with only republicans and the number of ways to form a group with only Democrats from the total number of ways to form a group:
\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to form a 5-member business group with at least one tag from each party is:
\[
\boxed{1940}
\]","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487)
\]

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Now, we multiply these two results together:

\[
(513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000
\]

Therefore, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is:

\[
\boxed{26000}

"Let the three consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). According to the problem, their product is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]

We also know that this product divided by the average of the three integers equals 24. The average of the three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

So, we can write the second equation as:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]

This can be rewritten using the difference of squares:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]

Adding 1 to both sides, we get:

\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]

We need to check both solutions to find the largest of the three consecutive integers.

1. If \( n = 5 \), the three consecutive integers are \( 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \). Their product is:

\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]

This satisfies the first equation. The average of these integers is:

\[
\frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = 5
\]

And the product divided by the average is:

\[
\frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

This satisfies the second equation. Therefore, the largest of the three integers is \( 6 \).

2. If \( n = -5 \), the three consecutive integers are \( -6, -5, \) and \( -4 \). Their product is:

\[
-6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120
\]

This does not satisfy the first equation. Therefore, \( n = -5 \) is not a valid solution.

The only valid solution is \( n = 5 \), so the largest of the three consecutive integers is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root. We do this by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) where \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\). This polynomial can be derived from the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

The product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) is given by \(\frac{1}{8}\) (by Vieta's formulas). However, we need to consider the product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\), which are the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) excluding the root \(x = 1\). Therefore, the product of the cosines is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and the altitude \(AM = 11\). There is a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDC\), we can use the Law of Sines:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}
\]
Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(D\) is on the median \(AM\)), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi - \theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{CD}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi - \theta}{2}\right)}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(BD = CD\), we can focus on the relationship between \(BC\) and \(\sin 3\theta\):
\[
BC = \sin 3\theta \cdot \frac{BD}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]

Next, we need to find the length of \(BD\). Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). In \(\triangle BDM\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\), we have:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1
\]
Thus,
\[
BD = \sqrt{\frac{BC^2}{4} + 1}
\]

Substituting \(BD\) back into the equation for \(BC\), we get:
\[
BC = \sin 3\theta \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\frac{BC^2}{4} + 1}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]

We also know that in \(\triangle ABM\), by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{BC^2}{4}
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \sqrt{121 + \frac{BC^2}{4}}
\]

Since \(AB = AC\), the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2\sqrt{121 + \frac{BC^2}{4}} + BC
\]

To find \(BC\), we use the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\):
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta
\]
We also know that \(\sin \theta = \frac{BC}{2AB}\). Substituting \(\sin \theta\) into the identity, we get:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \cdot \frac{BC}{2AB} - 4 \left(\frac{BC}{2AB}\right)^3 = \frac{3BC}{2AB} - \frac{BC^3}{2AB^3}
\]

Substituting \(\sin 3\theta\) back into the equation for \(BC\), we get:
\[
BC = \left(\frac{3BC}{2AB} - \frac{BC^3}{2AB^3}\right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\frac{BC^2}{4} + 1}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]

By solving this equation, we find that \(BC = 22\). Therefore, the length of \(AB\) is:
\[
AB = \sqrt{121 + \frac{22^2}{4}} = \sqrt{121 + 121} = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}
\]

The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{2} + 11\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22(\sqrt{2} + 1)

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To solve for \(a\), we divide both sides by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). Since there are 27 terms in the sequence, the median is the 14th term. The 14th term in the sequence is:
\[
68 + 13 = 81

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, let's make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(y\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \).

- For \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is true in the interval \( (-\infty, 3) \).

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is false in the interval \( (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we convert back to \(x\):
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answer

Combining the solutions from both parts, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the final answer in interval notation is:

"A megoldásban a symmetric polynomials propertiesat használjuk. Let's denote \( s = x + y + z \), \( p = xy + yz + zx \), and \( q = xyz \). From the given equations, we know:
\[
q = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
4 - 12 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the sum of squares:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation for the sum of cubes, we get:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p),
\]
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3ps.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
s^3 - 3ps + 8 = 0.
\]

Now, we use the identity for the sum of products of variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
12 = sp - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = sp - 12,
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
So, we have:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \( p = \frac{24}{s} \) into the equation \( s^3 - 3ps + 8 = 0 \), we get:
\[
s^3 - 3s \left( \frac{24}{s} \right) + 8 = 0,
\]
\[
s^3 - 72 + 8 = 0,
\]
\[
s^3 - 64 = 0,
\]
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.
\]
Now, substituting \( s = 4 \) back into the equation \( p = \frac{24}{s} \), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

First, let's calculate 135% of the percentage of female buszjárók for each school year:

1. For the 9th school year:
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 39.4\% = 1.35 \times 39.4 = 53.79\%
   \]
   The percentage of male buszjárók is 41.1%. The difference is:

2. For the 10th school year:
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 33.1\% = 1.35 \times 33.1 = 44.685\%
   \]
   The percentage of male buszjárók is 34.4%. The difference is:
   \[
   44.685\% - 34.4\% = 10.285\%
   \]

3. For the 11th school year:
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 13.8\% = 1.35 \times 13.8 = 18.63\%
   \]
   The percentage of male buszjárók is 20.6%. The difference is:
   \[
   20.6\% - 18.63\% = 1.97\%

4. For the 12th school year:
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 8.6\% = 1.35 \times 8.6 = 11.55\%

   The percentage of male buszjárók is 11.6%. The difference is:
   \[
   11.6\% - 11.55\% = 0.05\%

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's determine the intervals where \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and where \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x - 9)(x + 9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are negative, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x - 9\) is negative and \(x + 9\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x - 36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), so these points are excluded from the solution set because they make the denominator zero.

We need to determine the sign of the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in each of the intervals where the numerator and the denominator are defined.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x < -9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 < 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the quotient is positive.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(-9 < x < 0\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(0 < x < 9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(9 < x < 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x > 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 > 0\). Therefore, the quotient is positive.

Combining these results, the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the walking path. The path consists of two straight segments along the length and width of the rectangle, and two semicircles at the ends of these segments. The total length of the path is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The two straight segments along the length and width each have a length equal to \( l \) and \( w \) respectively. The two semicircles each have a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, which is \( \frac{w}{2} \). The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{w}{2} \) is \( 2\pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = \pi w \), so the total length of the two semicircles is \( \pi w \).

The total length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the two straight segments and the two semicircles:
\[
l + l + w + w + \pi w = 2l + (2 + \pi)w = 400
\]
We can solve this equation for \( l \) in terms of \( w \):
\[
2l = 400 - (2 + \pi)w
\]
\[
l = 200 - \left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)w
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = l \cdot w = \left(200 - \left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)w\right)w = 200w - \left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)w^2
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - 2\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)w = 200 - (2 + \pi)w
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[
200 - (2 + \pi)w = 0
\]
\[
(2 + \pi)w = 200
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{2 + \pi}
\]

Next, we substitute this value of \( w \) back into the equation for \( l \):
\[
l = 200 - \left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \left(\frac{200}{2 + \pi}\right) = 200 - \frac{200\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{2 + \pi} = 200 - \frac{200 + 100\pi}{2 + \pi}
\]
To simplify the expression, we find a common denominator:
\[
l = \frac{200(2 + \pi) - (200 + 100\pi)}{2 + \pi} = \frac{400 + 200\pi - 200 - 100\pi}{2 + \pi} = \frac{200 + 100\pi}{2 + \pi} = \frac{100(2 + \pi)}{2 + \pi} = 100
\]

Now that we have \( l = 100 \) and \( w = \frac{200}{2 + \pi} \), we can find the area \( A \):
\[
A = l \cdot w = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{2 + \pi} = \frac{20000}{2 + \pi}
\]

Given that \(RT = 5\) and \(ST = 2\), we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Since \(RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides (since \(RS\) is a length):
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of angle \(T\) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite angle \(T\) to the length of the hypotenuse. In triangle \(RST\), the side opposite angle \(T\) is \(RS = \sqrt{21}\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT = 5\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 4 \):
\[ -(4)^3 + 2(4)^2 + 3(4) - 6 = -64 + 32 + 12 - 6 = -26 \]
So, \( x = 4 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root.

Finally, let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root.

Finally, we have \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

"To determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by analyzing the given distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) with \( P \) being a point in space.

First, we place the octahedron in a coordinate system for convenience. A regular octahedron can be inscribed in a cube such that its vertices are at the midpoints of the edges of the cube. Let the side length of the cube be \( s \). The coordinates of the vertices of the octahedron can be chosen as follows:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

We are given the distances from \( P \) to these vertices:
- \( PA = 3 \)
- \( PB = 7 \)
- \( PC = 8 \)
- \( PD = 9 \)
- \( PE = 11 \)

We need to find the distance \( PF \).

Using the distance formula in three dimensions, the distance between two points \( (x_1, y_1, z_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2, z_2) \) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]

Let the coordinates of \( P \) be \( (x, y, z) \). We can write the distance equations for each given distance:
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2} = 11
\]

Squaring each equation to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Similarly, subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y + 2x = 55
\]

Subtract the first equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 81 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 2x = 72
\]

Subtract the first equation from the fifth:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 121 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 112
\]
\[
y^2 + z^2 + 2x = 112
\]

We now have three new equations:
\[
y^2 - 2y + 2x = 55
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 2x = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + z^2 + 2x = 112
\]

Subtract the first new equation from the second:
\[
(y^2 + 2y + 2x) - (y^2 - 2y + 2x) = 72 - 55
\]
\[
4y = 17
\]
\[
y = \frac{17}{4}
\]

Substitute \( y = \frac{17}{4} \) into the first new equation:
\[

\]
\[
\frac{289}{16} - \frac{34}{4} + 2x = 55
\]
\[
\frac{289}{16} - \frac{136}{16} + 2x = 55
\]
\[
\frac{153}{16} + 2x = 55
\]
\[
2x = 55 - \frac{153}{16}
\]
\[
2x = \frac{880}{16} - \frac{153}{16}
\]
\[
2x = \frac{727}{16}
\]
\[
x = \frac{727}{32}

Substitute \( x = \frac{727}{32} \) into the third new equation:
\[
\left(\frac{17}{4}\right)^2 + z^2 + 2\left(\frac{727}{32}\right) = 112
\]
\[
\frac{289}{16} + z^2 + \frac{1454}{16} = 112
\]
\[
\frac{1743}{16} + z^2 = 112
\]
\[
z^2 = 112 - \frac{1743}{16}
\]
\[
z^2 = \frac{1792}{16} - \[
\frac{1743}{16}
\]
\[
z^2 = \frac{49}{16}
\]
\[
z = \pm \frac{7}{4}

Finally, we find the distance \( PF \):
\[
PF = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2}
\]
Substitute \( x = \frac{727}{32} \), \( y = \frac{17}{4} \), and \( z = \frac{7}{4} \):
\[
PF = \sqrt{\left(\frac{727}{32}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{17}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{7}{4} - 1\right)^2}
\]
\[
PF = \sqrt{\left(\frac{727}{32}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{17}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2}
\]
\[
PF = \sqrt{\frac{528529}{1024} + \frac{289}{16} + \frac{9}{16}}
\]
\[
PF = \sqrt{\frac{528529}{1024} + \frac{298}{16}}
\]
\[
PF = \sqrt{\frac{528529}{1024} + \frac{1888}{1024}}

\[
PF = \frac{\sqrt{530417}}{32}

\[

"To determine the ratio of Jen's ball's acceleration to Jack's ball's acceleration, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force \( F \) applied to an object is equal to the mass \( m \) of the object multiplied by its acceleration \( a \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Given that Jen and Jack apply the same force to their respective balls, we can set up the following equations for the force applied to each ball:

For Jen's softball:
\[ F = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \]

For Jack's baseball:
\[ F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Since the force \( F \) is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls:
\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of Jen's ball's acceleration to Jack's ball's acceleration, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base-7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base-8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:

- The digit 5 appears 2 times.
- The digit 6 appears 1 time.

Adding these counts together, we get:

\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. Then we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 - 4 = 0\), which simplifies to \(t^3 - 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = \sqrt[3]{4}\), \(t = \omega \sqrt[3]{4}\), and \(t = \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{4}\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) is a primitive cube root of unity. Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"Let's define the cost of one ceruza as \( c \) dollars and the cost of one jumbo radír as \( r \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

1. The cost of three ceruza and one jumbo radír is \$1.24:
   \[
   3c + r = 1.24
   \]

2. The cost of five ceruza and one jumbo radír is \$1.82:
   \[
   5c + r = 1.82
   \]

To find the cost of one ceruza, we can eliminate \( r \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5c + r) - (3c + r) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
5c + r - 3c - r = 2c
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
2c = 0.58
\]
To solve for \( c \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
c = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]
Therefore, the cost of one ceruza is \$0.29, which is equivalent to 29 cents. The answer is:

"To determine the last non-zero digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first convert the fraction to its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

We can convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

Let's do the division step-by-step:

1. **Set up the division:**
   \[
   137 \div 500
   \]

2. **Since 137 is less than 500, we add a decimal point and a zero to make it 1370:**
   \[
   1370 \div 500
   \]

3. **Divide 1370 by 500:**
   \[
   1370 \div 500 = 2.74
   \]

Thus, the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:
\[
0.274
\]

Now, we identify the last non-zero digit in the decimal expansion \(0.274\). The digits are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit is 4.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(B\) is:
\[
d(P, B) = \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(C\) is:
\[
d(P, C) = \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(D\) is:
\[
d(P, D) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying each inequality:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities describe four regions in the rectangle. Each region is a quadrilateral formed by the lines:
\[
ax - by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}, \quad ax + by = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}, \quad ax - by = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}, \quad ax + by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

The intersection of these lines forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \cdot \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = 2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{2a^2b^2}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}
\]

Given \(k = \frac{a}{b}\), we substitute \(a = kb\) into the expression:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(kb)^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4(kb)^2} = \frac{k^2b^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4k^2b^2} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4k^2}
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:
\[54 = 6q + r\]
where \(0 \leq r < 6\).

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now, we substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]
\[54 = 54 + r\]
Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, marad after converting the total amount into banknotes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have together.
2. Determine the remainder when this total amount is divided by 100 (since each banknote is worth $100).

First, let's add up the amounts each person has:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

We can add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they have together is $126.59.

Next, we need to find out how much money is left after converting this total amount into banknotes. Since each banknote is worth $100, we divide $126.59 by 100 and find the remainder:
\[
126.59 \div 100 = 1.2659
\]
The integer part of the division is 1, which means they can convert $100 into 1 banknote. The remainder is:
\[
126.59 - 100 = 26.59
\]

The remainder $26.59$ consists of 26 dollars and 59 cents. Since we are asked how much money, in cents, marad, we convert the dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents) and add the remaining cents:
\[
26 \times 100 + 59 = 2600 + 59 = 2659

Therefore, the amount of money that marad is:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

The magic square becomes:

The sum of the main diagonal is:

"To determine how many feet less Jim sets than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim walks diagonally across the rectangular meadow. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, the length of the meadow is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. So, the distance Jim travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Jim travels} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha walks along the length and the width of the meadow, so she travels the length plus the width:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\), which is the real number 1. However, since \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity, it cannot be 1. Therefore, \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the roots we are interested in.

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we start by finding a common denominator for the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\omega^3 = 1\), which implies that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Now, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). We expand this product:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
