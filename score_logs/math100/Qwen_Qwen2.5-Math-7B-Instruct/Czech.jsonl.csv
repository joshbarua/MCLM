"To find the length of \(DE\), we start by analyzing the given right triangle \(DEF\). We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of \(EF\) is 7. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this triangle, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]

Substituting the given value of \(EF\):

\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:

\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In triangle \(DEF\), we have:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:

\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can use the formula for rotation in the complex plane. The rotation of a complex number \( z \) around a point \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \). The angle of rotation is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). The exponential form of \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) is \( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

First, we need to find \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Next, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):

\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We use the distributive property (FOIL method) to expand this product:

\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Simplify each term:

\[ \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]
\[ \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \cdot \frac{2}{2} = i \]
\[ -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i \cdot \frac{2}{2} = -3i \]
\[ -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i^2 \cdot \frac{2}{2} = -3(-1) = 3 \]

Combine the terms:

\[ 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i \]

Now, we add this result to \( c \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is:

\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \]","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways Kolika can arrange 8 lidí around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 lidí) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. Here, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 lidí around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways Kolika can arrange 8 lidí around a round table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). We substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot x^{-6}
\]

The \(x^6\) and \(x^{-6}\) terms cancel each other out:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = \binom{5}{3} \cdot -\frac{100}{8} = \binom{5}{3} \cdot -12.5
\]

Calculate \(\binom{5}{3}\):

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3!}{3! \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}

"To determine the minimum number of degrees by which a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions in which the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated around its center. The angle of rotation for each symmetry is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full circle) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate the angle of rotation as follows:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). This means that the point \( D(6, -1) \) is not correct. Let's recheck the problem and find another way to solve it.

Let's use another property of parallelogram. The vector from \( A \) to \( B \) is equal to the vector from \( C \) to \( D \):
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{CD}
\]

Calculating the vector \( \overrightarrow{AB} \):
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} = (6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)
\]

Calculating the vector \( \overrightarrow{CD} \):
\[
\overrightarrow{CD} = (x-7, y-4)
\]

Setting the vectors equal to each other:
\[
(1, 5) = (x-7, y-4)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
x-7 = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad y-4 = 5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
x-7 = 1 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
y-4 = 5 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of \( D \) are \( (8, 9) \).

Finally, we find the value of \( x + y \):
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

Substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) z hlady, we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, specifically \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). However, we need to adjust the middle term to match the form. Instead, let's consider the expression in a different way.

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

First, let's express \( A \bold{v} \) for a general vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Define the function \( f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \) and the constraint \( g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 \). The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y) \quad \text{and} \quad \nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\lambda\), we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13 \implies \frac{6y}{x} - \frac{6x}{y} = 9 \implies \frac{6y^2 - 6x^2}{xy} = 9 \implies \frac{6(y^2 - x^2)}{xy} = 9 \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
y = 2x \quad \text{and} \quad y = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

We substitute these solutions into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \):

1. For \( y = 2x \):

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \quad y = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \) and \( y = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \) into \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. For \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \):

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \quad y = \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \) and \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \) into \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot \left( -\frac{2}{5} \right) + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.

   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}
   \]

   For \(18_9\):
   \[
   18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}
   \]

2. **Subtract the base 10 equivalents.**

   \[
   53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
   \]

3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

   To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
   \[
   36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0
   \]
   So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Finally, we recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}
\]","[cot(x), '\\cot x']",\cot x,[],True
"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( t \) is the weight of one treek.
- \( s \) is the weight of one squig.
- \( g \) is the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. Deset treeků váží stejne jako tři squigové a jeden goolee.
2. Dva treekové a один goolee mají stejou váhu jako один squig.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( 10t = 3s + g \)
2. \( 2t + g = s \)

We need to find the weight of one squig in terms of the weight of one treek, i.e., we need to solve for \( s \) in terms of \( t \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = s - 2t \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[ 10t = 3s + (s - 2t) \]
\[ 10t = 4s - 2t \]
\[ 12t = 4s \]
\[ s = 3t \]

So, the weight of one squig is 3 times the weight of one treek. Therefore, the combinatorial weight of how many treeků is equal to the weight of one squig is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form is given by:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expanded form is equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\)
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation \(-2a = 6\), we solve for \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{6}{-2} = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t^3\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[
3b = 6
\]

Divide by 3:

\[
b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

The final answer is:

\boxed{-1}

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius \(r\) of the tank.

First, recall the formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. Since the tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, we can express this as:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi
\]
The rate at which the volume is changing is also equal to the rate at which the height is changing multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. The cross-sectional area of the cylinder is \(\pi r^2\), and the rate at which the height is changing is 4 meters per hour. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Substituting the given values \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\), we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
20 = 4r^2
\]
Next, we solve for \(r^2\) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[
r^2 = 5
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]
Thus, the radius of the tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{pokud } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{pokud } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
If \(a > 0\), then \(a^3 > 0\), and the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) will take on all values greater than or equal to \(a^3\). If \(a < 0\), then \(a^3 < 0\), and the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) will take on all values less than or equal to \(a^3\).

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a straight line with slope \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). If \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every vertical line
For the function to intersect every vertical line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must cover all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\), and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We can use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the inequality holds:
- For \(a < -1\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) < 0\).
- For \(-1 < a < 0\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) > 0\).
- For \(0 < a < 2\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) < 0\).
- For \(a > 2\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) > 0\).

Since we are looking for the largest value of \(a\) such that the inequality holds, we consider the interval \(0 < a \leq 2\). The largest value in this interval is \(a = 2\).

If \(a < 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\), and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). Since \(a^3 < 0\) and \(a^2 + 2a > 0\) for \(a < 0\), the function does not cover all real numbers.

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must not be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation \(-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0\) and check if it satisfies it:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) \right] + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda^2 - 1 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 \right] = 0.
\]
For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we need:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + 2\lambda^3 + \lambda^4 - 2\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
\lambda^4 - \lambda^2 + 1 = 0.
\]
This equation has no real solutions because \(\lambda^4 - \lambda^2 + 1 = (\lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{3}{4} > 0\) for all real \(\lambda\). Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) that works is when \(\lambda = 2\), because we need to check if there is a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(\lambda = 2\) and \(f(x) \neq x\):
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2,
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = 2(4x^3 - 8x^3 + 4x - 4x^4 + 4x^2 - 2x^2) = 2(-4x^4 + 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x) = -8x^4 + 8x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x.
\]
Setting \(f(f(x)) = x\), we get:
\[
-8x^4 + 8x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x = x \implies -8x^4 + 8x^3 + 4x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-8x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x + 3) = 0.
\]
So, \(x = 0\) or \(-8x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x + 3 = 0\). We need to check if there is a root of \(-8x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x + 3 = 0\) in the interval \([0,1]\) other than \(x = 0\). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since \(-8(0)^3 + 8(0)^2 + 4(0) + 3 = 3\) and \(-8(1)^3 + 8(1)^2 + 4(1) + 3 = 3\), there is no root in \([0,1]\) other than \(x = 0\). Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) that works is \(\lambda = 2\).

"To solve for the velocity of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we can use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]
Using the angle subtraction formulas \(\cos(45^\circ - x) = \cos 45^\circ \cos x + \sin 45^\circ \sin x\) and \(\sin(45^\circ - x) = \sin 45^\circ \cos x - \cos 45^\circ \sin x\), we get:
\[
\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 20^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 20^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 40^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 40^\circ}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 20^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 20^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 40^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 40^\circ}.
\]
Factoring out \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) from both the numerator and the denominator, we get:
\[
\frac{\cos 20^\circ + \sin 20^\circ + \cos 40^\circ - \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ - \sin 20^\circ - \cos 40^\circ - \sin 40^\circ}.
\]
This expression is quite complex, so we use a different approach. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 45^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \cos 40^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 40^\circ}{\sin 45^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \cos 40^\circ - \sin 45^\circ \sin 40^\circ}.
\]
Using the tangent addition formula, we get:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \tan(45^\circ + 25^\circ) = \tan 70^\circ.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{3!}

Next, we calculate \( 7! \) and \( 3! \):

7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 6 \):

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
f_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule, we get:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y)
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_x = \frac{(1 - y^2) - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Setting \( f_x = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
1 - y^2 - xy = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1 - y^2}{y}
\]

Similarly, we find the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):

\[
f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule again:

\[
f_y = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y) + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Simplifying the first term:

\[
f_y = -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Setting \( f_y = 0 \):

\[
-\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - x^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - y^2}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( 1 - y^2 \):

\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]

Subtracting \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides:

\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]

Thus:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin in the \( xy \)-plane. We now evaluate \( f(x, y) \) on this circle.

Substitute \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x \sqrt{1 - (\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Simplifying inside the square roots:

\[
f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} + (1 - x^2)
\]

\[
f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x \sqrt{x^2} + (1 - x^2)
\]

Since \( \sqrt{x^2} = |x| \):

\[
f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x |x| + (1 - x^2)
\]

We consider two cases: \( x \ge 0 \) and \( x < 0 \).

**Case 1: \( x \ge 0 \)**

\[
f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x^2 + (1 - x^2) = 1
\]

**Case 2: \( x < 0 \)**

\[
f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = -x^2 + (1 - x^2) = 1 - 2x^2
\]

Since \( x^2 \) is always non-negative and \( x^2 \le 1 \) on the circle, the maximum value of \( 1 - 2x^2 \) occurs when \( x^2 = 0 \):

\[
1 - 2(0) = 1
\]

Thus, in both cases, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 1.

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\|
\]

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component:

\[
\mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Finally, we calculate the area of the triangle:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the centroid \(G\) of a triangle and the relationship between the areas of similar triangles.

1. **Centroid Properties**: The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

2. **Similar Triangles**: Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line parallel to the base. In this case, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distance from \(A\) to \(MN\) to the distance from \(A\) to \(BC\).

3. **Distance Ratio**: The distance from \(A\) to \(MN\) is the distance from \(A\) to \(G\) plus the distance from \(G\) to \(MN\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \(G\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the distance from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the distance from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(2 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from \(A\) to \(BC\).

4. **Area Ratio**: The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\), the ratio of the areas of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\).

5. **Area of Triangle \(AMN\)**: The area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64
   \]

6. **Area of Triangle \(ENG\)**: Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(AMN\) and its area is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the area of triangle \(AMN\) (because \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, and \(EG\) is half of \(AG\)). Therefore, the area of triangle \(ENG\) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16

Thus, the area of triangle \(ENG\) is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",8,"[8, '8']",False

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]

   The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\). We can rewrite this as:
   \[
   2^2 = 4
   \]
   \[
   5^7 = 78125

   Therefore,

3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**
   To convert \(\frac{21}{312500}\) to a decimal, we perform the division \(21 \div 312500\).

   Let's do the division step-by-step:
   - \(312500\) goes into \(21\) zero times.
   - Add a decimal point and a zero to make it \(210\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(210\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(2100\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2100\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(21000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(21000\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(210000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(210000\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(2100000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2100000\) six times (since \(312500 \times 6 = 1875000\)).
   - Subtract \(1875000\) from \(2100000\) to get a remainder of \(225000\).
   - Add another zero to make it \(2250000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2250000\) seven times (since \(312500 \times 7 = 2187500\)).
   - Subtract \(2187500\) from \(2250000\) to get a remainder of \(62500\).
   - Add another zero to make it \(625000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(625000\) two times (since \(312500 \times 2 = 625000\)).
   - Subtract \(625000\) from \(625000\) to get a remainder of \(0\).

"To determine how many two-digit divisors of both 100 and 150 there are, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 and then identify all two-digit divisors of that GCD.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2

Let \( d \) be the number of ten-cent coins and \( p \) be the number of five-cent coins. According to the problem, Hillary has a total of 12 coins, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ d + p = 12 \]

We are also given that the total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since each ten-cent coin is worth 10 cents and each five-cent coin is worth 5 cents, we can write the second equation as:

\[ 10d + 5p = 75 \]

To simplify the second equation, we can divide every term by 5:

\[ 2d + p = 15 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( d + p = 12 \)
2. \( 2d + p = 15 \)

We can eliminate \( p \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

\[ (2d + p) - (d + p) = 15 - 12 \]
\[ 2d + p - d - p = 3 \]
\[ d = 3 \]

Now that we know \( d = 3 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( p \):

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. They are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and the rest are odd numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number. Since each of them has 6 choices, the total number of outcomes is:
\[

Now, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only 1 even number, so there is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) way for both to choose an even number.

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

The probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

- Triangle 2: \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\)

### Step 2: Calculate the area of Triangle 1
Triangle 1 is a right triangle with the base along the x-axis and the height along the y-axis.
- Base: \(2\) units (from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\))
- Height: \(4\) units (from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\))

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only zeros and ones, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must have at least two trailing zeros.

Next, we need to ensure that the remaining part of the number (after the trailing zeros) is a multiple of 2 and \(3^2 = 9\). A number is a multiple of 2 if its last digit is even, and since the digits are only 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0. However, we already have two trailing zeros, so we only need to ensure that the remaining part is a multiple of 9. A number is a multiple of 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.

The smallest number consisting of only the digits 0 and 1 that is a multiple of 9 is 111111111 (nine 1's), because \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\), which is a multiple of 9. Therefore, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 11111111100.

To confirm, we check the prime factorization of 11111111100:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(2^2 = 4\).
- The sum of the digits is 9, so it is divisible by 9.
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).

Since 11111111100 is divisible by 2, 9, and 25, it is divisible by \(2 \times 9 \times 25 = 450\).

Thus, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only zeros and ones is:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

"To determine the tvar popsaný rovicient \( z = c \) vylinderických souřadně \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

In cylinderické souřadně, a point in space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis,
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane,
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the surface \( z = c \) is a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \). This plane extends infinitely in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \( c \) in the \( z \)-direction.

"To find the smallest possible angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (or \(150^\circ\), but we are asked for the smallest possible angle). Therefore, the smallest possible angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015. \]

Next, we expand each term in the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[ (x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125, \]
\[ -49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225, \]
\[ 623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115. \]

Now, we combine all these expanded terms:

\[ g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) + (-49x^2 - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015. \]

We simplify by combining like terms:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.

Rearranging this equation, we get:

"To determine the number of sides of Kolik's convex polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides. The sum of the interior angles of an \( n \)-sided polygon is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon except one is \( 1070^\circ \). Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \( x \). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is:

\[
1070^\circ + x
\]

Since this sum must equal \( 180(n-2) \), we can write the equation:

\[
1070^\circ + x = 180(n-2)
\]

The interior angle \( x \) must be less than \( 180^\circ \) because the polygon is convex. Therefore, we have:

\[
1070^\circ < 180(n-2) < 1250^\circ
\]

We will solve these inequalities step by step. First, solve the left inequality:

\[
1070^\circ < 180(n-2)
\]

Divide both sides by 180:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
5.9444 < n-2
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
7.9444 < n

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have:

\[
n \geq 8

Next, solve the right inequality:

\[
180(n-2) < 1250^\circ
\]

Divide both sides by 180:

\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
n-2 < 6.9444

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
n < 8.9444

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test the values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \]
So, the side length of the cube is 1 foot.

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found, we get:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \]
So, the area of one face of the cube is 1 square foot.

**Step 3: Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( S \) is:

The rectangle spans from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). For a point to be strictly inside the rectangle, its \(x\)-coordinate must be greater than \(-5\) and less than \(5\), and its \(y\)-coordinate must be greater than \(-4\) and less than \(4\).

(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a},
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}).
\]

We can factor out the constants from the cross products:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these vectors into the expression, we have:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ 21 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ 21 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of \(ABCD\) is 42, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar by the Angle Bisector Theorem. This means that the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]
\]

Using the ratio of the areas, we can express \([\triangle ABC]\) in terms of \([\triangle ACD]\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{a} [\triangle ACD]
\]

Substituting this into the area equation, we get:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] + \frac{b}{a} [\triangle ACD]
\]
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right)
\]
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right)
\]
Solving for \([\triangle ACD]\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = 42 \cdot \frac{a}{a + b}
\]

Next, we need to find the ratio \(\frac{a}{a + b}\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle. Let's drop a perpendicular from \(B\) to \(AD\) and call the foot of the perpendicular \(E\). Then \(BE = CD = c\) and \(AE = AD - DE = a - b\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar, and the ratio of the corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{d}{c} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

In \(\triangle ACD\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d^2 = a^2 - c^2
\]

In \(\triangle ABC\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from \(B\) to \(AD\):
\[
d^2 = b^2 + c^2
\]

Since both expressions equal \(d^2\), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
a^2 - c^2 = b^2 + c^2
\]
\[
a^2 = b^2 + 2c^2
\]
\[
\frac{a^2}{b^2} = 1 + \frac{2c^2}{b^2}
\]
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2c^2}{b^2}}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot BE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot c
\]

The ratio of the areas is:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot c} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the ratio \(\frac{a}{b}\) is also equal to the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{a}{a + b} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Substituting this back into the equation for the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = 42 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 28

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[

   \[

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}}

   Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( @ \) to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}\). Therefore, we substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the operation:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \times 21}{30}
\]

We can simplify the fraction \(\frac{70 \times 21}{30}\) by canceling out the common factors. Notice that \(70\) and \(30\) have a common factor of \(10\):

\[
\frac{70 \times 21}{30} = \frac{(10 \times 7) \times 21}{10 \times 3} = \frac{7 \times 21}{3}

Now, we calculate \(7 \times 21\):

\[

So, the fraction becomes:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we list the points in clockwise order, they must alternate.

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (for rotations) and by 2 (for reflections). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   But this is incorrect because we need to consider the specific order of the points. Instead, we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second segment. This gives us:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]
   However, we need to consider the order of the segments, so we need to divide by 2 again:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: For the segments to intersect, the points must alternate. There are 2 ways to arrange the points such that they alternate (either \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\)). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Therefore, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To determine the size of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the two circles. The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[

The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
According to the problem, the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller segment} = \text{Area of the smaller sector} - \text{Area of the smaller triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \theta \times 1^2 - \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta

The area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger segment} = \text{Area of the larger sector} - \text{Area of the larger triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \theta \times 2^2 - \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \sin \theta = 2\theta - 2\sin \theta
\]
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta + 2\theta - 2\sin \theta = \frac{5}{2} \theta - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta
\]
We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5}{2} \theta - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
We can divide both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[

\]
To solve this equation, we need to find a value of \(\theta\) that satisfies it. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution because:
\[
\frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

Therefore, the correct value is \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}\). To convert this angle to degrees, we use the conversion factor \(\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}\):

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical mug. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical mug, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:

This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2

\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee consisting only of republikánů. This is given by \(\binom{8}{5}\):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee consisting only of demokratů. This is given by \(\binom{6}{5}\):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

Now, subtract the number of subcommittees consisting only of republikánů and the number of subcommittees consisting only of demokratů from the total number of subcommittees to find the number of subcommittees that include at least one republikán and one demokrat:

\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that includes at least one republikán and one demokrat is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487)

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we multiply these two results together:

\[
(513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"Given three consecutive integers \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \), their product is 120. We can express this as:

\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]

We are also given that the product of these three numbers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three numbers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

So, the product divided by the average is:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = (n-1)(n+1) = n^2 - 1
\]

We know this equals 24, so we can set up the equation:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]

Adding 1 to both sides, we get:

\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]

We need to check both cases.

**Case 1: \( n = 5 \)**

The three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6. Their product is:

\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]

This satisfies the first condition. The average is 5, and the product divided by the average is:

\[
\frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

This satisfies the second condition. Therefore, the three integers are 4, 5, and 6, and the largest of these integers is 6.

**Case 2: \( n = -5 \)**

The three consecutive integers are -6, -5, and -4. Their product is:

\[
-6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120

This does not satisfy the first condition, so we discard this case.

Thus, the largest of the three consecutive integers is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root. We do this by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x - 2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we choose \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{6\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{10\pi}{15}, \frac{12\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\). Notice that:

\]

We can factor out \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the product becomes:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we know that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Let \(BD = DC = x\). Since \(AD = 10\), it follows that \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

We are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \theta\) and \(\angle CDM = 90^\circ - \theta\).

In \(\triangle BDC\), we apply the Law of Cosines:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(\angle BDC)
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
(2x)^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cos(3\theta)
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
4x^2 = 2x^2 - 2x^2 \cos(3\theta)
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
2x^2 = -2x^2 \cos(3\theta)
\]
Dividing both sides by \(2x^2\) (assuming \(x \neq 0\)), we get:
\[
1 = -\cos(3\theta)
\]
Thus, \(\cos(3\theta) = -1\). The angle whose cosine is \(-1\) is \(180^\circ\), so:
\[
3\theta = 180^\circ \implies \theta = 60^\circ
\]
Therefore, \(\angle BAC = 60^\circ\), and \(\triangle ABC\) is an equilateral triangle. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be \(s\). Then \(BC = s\), and since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BM = MC = \frac{s}{2}\).

In \(\triangle ABM\), we apply the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2

Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
s^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2

Simplifying, we have:
\[
s^2 = 121 + \frac{s^2}{4}

Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
4s^2 = 484 + s^2
\]
Subtracting \(s^2\) from both sides, we get:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms. In this case, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a + 26\). Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
\frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a + 26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
We know that the sum of the sequence is \(3^7\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 \times (a + 13) = 3^7

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which is always greater than \(-4\). This means that the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are:
\[y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) and keep \(y = 3\). Therefore, we have:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),

which simplifies to:
\[

\]
or
\[

\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,

which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:

   The percentage of mužských cestujíce is \(11.6\%\). The difference is:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases}

-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x \leq -9\) and \(x < 9\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x < -9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 < 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(-9 < x < 9\) is true, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:

   Since \(-9 < x < 0\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(-9 < x < 9\) is true, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(0 < x < 9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(-9 < x < 9\) is false and \(x \leq -9\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(9 < x < 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(-9 < x < 9\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x > 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 > 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so the quotient is positive.

Combining all the intervals where the quotient is negative, we get:
\[

"To determine the maximum possible area of the obdlníkové pole, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight segments (each of length \(a\)) and two semicircular segments (each of radius \(r\)). The total length of the track is 400 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation for the perimeter of the track as:

\[2a + 2\pi r = 400\]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[a + \pi r = 200\]

We need to express the area \(A\) of the obdlníkové pole in terms of \(a\) and \(r\). The area of the obdlníkové pole consists of the area of the rectangle and the area of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \(a \times 2r = 2ar\), and the area of the two semicircles is \(\pi r^2\). Therefore, the total area \(A\) is:

\[A = 2ar + \pi r^2\]

From the perimeter equation \(a + \pi r = 200\), we can solve for \(a\):

\[a = 200 - \pi r\]

Substituting this expression for \(a\) into the area formula, we get:

\[A = 2(200 - \pi r)r + \pi r^2\]
\[A = 400r - 2\pi r^2 + \pi r^2\]
\[A = 400r - \pi r^2\]

To find the maximum value of \(A\), we take the derivative of \(A\) with respect to \(r\) and set it equal to zero:

\[\frac{dA}{dr} = 400 - 2\pi r\]
\[400 - 2\pi r = 0\]
\[2\pi r = 400\]
\[r = \frac{400}{2\pi}\]
\[r = \frac{200}{\pi}\]

Next, we substitute \(r = \frac{200}{\pi}\) back into the expression for \(a\):

\[a = 200 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)\]
\[a = 200 - 200\]
\[a = 0\]

However, this result is not correct because it would imply that the rectangle has no width, which is not possible. Let's recheck the calculation for the maximum area by redefining the problem.

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- The hypotenuse \(RT = 5\)

First, we use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, the opposite side to \(\angle R\) is \(ST\), and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
\[
\frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
Since \(RT = 5\), we can solve for \(ST\):
\[
ST = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Using the definition of sine again:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, the opposite side to \(\angle T\) is \(RS\), and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) as a function of \(x\). The distance formula gives us:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expanding \((x^2 - 3)^2\), we get:

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substituting this back into the expression for \(d\), we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0 \implies 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us three critical points: \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

In the form \(\sqrt{a}/b\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

\boxed{12}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]

So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]

"To find the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting the coordinates of the vertices of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron can be inscribed in a cube such that the vertices of the octahedron are the midpoints of the faces of the cube. If we place the cube in a coordinate system with side length 2, the vertices of the octahedron are \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\).

Let the coordinates of point \( P \) be \((x, y, z)\). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices \((1, 0, 0)\), \((-1, 0, 0)\), \((0, 1, 0)\), \((0, -1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, 1)\) are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We can write these distances as follows:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3,
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11.
\]

We square each equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49,
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64,
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121.
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 49 - 9,
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 40,
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40,
\]
\[
4x = 40,
\]
\[
x = 10.
\]

Similarly, we subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 64 - 9,
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 = 55,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 - y^2 = 55,
\]
\[
2x - 2y = 55,
\]
\[
x - y = \frac{55}{2}.
\]

Since \( x = 10 \), we substitute \( x \) into the equation \( x - y = \frac{55}{2} \):
\[
10 - y = \frac{55}{2},
\]
\[
-y = \frac{55}{2} - 10,
\]
\[
-y = \frac{55}{2} - \frac{20}{2},
\]
\[
-y = \frac{35}{2},
\]
\[
y = -\frac{35}{2}.
\]

Next, we substitute \( x = 10 \) and \( y = -\frac{35}{2} \) into the first equation:
\[
(10-1)^2 + \left(-\frac{35}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
9^2 + \left(-\frac{35}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
81 + \frac{1225}{4} + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
\frac{324}{4} + \frac{1225}{4} + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
\frac{1549}{4} + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
z^2 = 9 - \frac{1549}{4},
\]
\[
z^2 = \frac{36}{4} - \frac{1549}{4},
\]
\[
z^2 = -\frac{1513}{4}.

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen wants to throw the softball with the same force as Jack throws the baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for each object, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We know the masses of the softball and the baseball:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \text{ g} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \text{ g} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} \]

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball is:

"To determine how many digits are common in the representations of the number \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The digits in \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, and 6.
The digits in \(1165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, and 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. There are 3 common digits.

Thus, the number of digits common in the representations of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the total number of handshakes that occurred on the magic tree, we need to consider the interactions between the crows and the swallows. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of each type of bird:**
   - There are 6 crows.
   - There are 10 swallows.

2. **Determine the handshakes between crows and swallows:**
   - Each crow shakes hands with each swallow.
   - Therefore, the total number of handshakes between crows and swallows is calculated by multiplying the number of crows by the number of swallows:
     \[
     6 \text{ crows} \times 10 \text{ swallows} = 60 \text{ handshakes}
     \]

3. **Determine the handshakes between swallows:**
   - Each swallow shakes hands with every other swallow.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 swallows out of 10 to shake hands is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the total number of swallows:
     \[
     \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45 \text{ handshakes}
     \]

4. **Determine the handshakes between crows:**
   - Each crow shakes hands with every other crow.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 crows out of 6 to shake hands is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the total number of crows:
     \[
     \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \text{ handshakes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of handshakes:**
   - Add the handshakes between crows and swallows, the handshakes between swallows, and the handshakes between crows:
     \[
     60 \text{ handshakes} + 45 \text{ handshakes} + 15 \text{ handshakes} = 120 \text{ handshakes}

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Now, we need to find the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0\), which simplifies to:

\[
t^3 + 4t = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(t\), we get:

\[
t(t^2 + 4) = 0.

"Let's define the cost of one tužka as \( t \) dollars and the cost of one velká gume as \( g \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

1. \( 3t + g = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5t + g = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( g \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:

\[
(5t + g) - (3t + g) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
5t + g - 3t - g = 2t
\]

And simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
1.82 - 1.24 = 0.58
\]

So, we have:

\[
2t = 0.58
\]

To find \( t \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[
t = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]

The cost of one tužka is \( 0.29 \) dollars. Since we need the answer in centech, we convert dollars to centech by multiplying by 100:

\[
0.29 \times 100 = 29
\]

Therefore, the cost of one tužka is \(\boxed{29}\) centech.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True
"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction to its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

We can convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

Let's do the division step-by-step:

1. **Set up the division:**
   \[
   137 \div 500
   \]

2. **Add decimal places:**
   Since \(137\) is less than \(500\), we add a decimal point and zeros to \(137\) to make the division possible:
   \[
   137.000
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   - \(500\) goes into \(1370\) \(2\) times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)).
     \[
     1370 - 1000 = 370
     \]
     So, we write \(2\) in the decimal place.

   - Bring down the next \(0\) to make it \(3700\).
     - \(500\) goes into \(3700\) \(7\) times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)).
       \[
       3700 - 3500 = 200
       \]
       So, we write \(7\) in the next decimal place.

   - Bring down the next \(0\) to make it \(2000\).
     - \(500\) goes into \(2000\) \(4\) times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)).
       \[
       2000 - 2000 = 0
       \]
       So, we write \(4\) in the next decimal place.

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the division is complete. The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:
\[
0.274
\]

The last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in \(0.274\) is \(4\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A = (-a, b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(B = (a, b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(C = (a, -b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(D = (-a, -b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Expanding each inequality:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities describe four regions in the rectangle. Each region is a quarter of the rectangle, and they are symmetrically placed around the center \(O\). Therefore, the area of each region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Area of rectangle} = \frac{1}{4} \times 4ab = ab
\]

The total area of the rectangle is:
\[
4ab
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of region closer to } O}{\text{Total area of rectangle}} = \frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}

Therefore, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:
\[54 = 6q + r\]
where \(0 \leq r < 6\).

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now, we substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]
\[54 = 54 + r\]
Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get:
\[r = 0\]

Thus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, was left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie exchanged their coins for dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money they collected:**
   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

2. **Add the amounts step by step:**
   - First, add Linda and Sherry's amounts:
     \[
     27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
     \]
   - Next, add June's amount to the result:
     \[
     62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
     \]
   - Finally, add Connie's amount to the result:
     \[
     100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
     \]

   So, the total amount of money they collected is \$126.59.

3. **Convert the total amount to cents:**
   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
   \[
   126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine how many whole dollars they have:**
   The whole dollar amount is the integer part of \$126.59, which is 126 dollars.

5. **Convert the whole dollars back to cents:**
   \[
   126 \times 100 = 12600 \text{ cents}

6. **Calculate the remaining cents:**
   Subtract the amount of money in whole dollars from the total amount in cents:

"To find the average (arithmetic mean) score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score for each group of students:

- The total score for the 20 students who scored 80 points each is:

- The total score for the 2 students who scored 100 points each is:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the numbers in the third row, the columns, and the diagonals using \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the numbers in the third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[

\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many stops less Jim ujde than Martha, we need to calculate the distances each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim jde diagonálně přes pole. The diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Here, the length of the pole is 400 stops and the width is 300 stops. So, the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ stops}

So, Jim travels 500 stops.

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
