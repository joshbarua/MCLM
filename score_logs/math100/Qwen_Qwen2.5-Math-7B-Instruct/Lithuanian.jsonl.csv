"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we get:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Substituting \( z' = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \):
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Substituting \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \):
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 monoes can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 monoes around a circular table.**

   For \( n \) people sitting around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 8 \), so the total number of arrangements is:
   \[
   (8-1)! = 7! = 5040
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange the monoes such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other.**

   If Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other, we can treat them as a single ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 monoes) around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange 6 blocks around a circular table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

   Within the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3! = 6\) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the monoes such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other is:
   \[
   5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange the monoes such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other.**

   This is simply the total number of arrangements minus the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other:
   \[
   5040 - 720 = 4320
   \]

Thus, the number of ways 8 monoes can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other is \(\boxed{5760}\).","[5760, '5760']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 10^2 x^{6} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{-6}
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 100 x^6 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) x^{-6}
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{25}{2}\right)

Therefore, the constant term is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}
\]

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}

"To determine the minimum number of steps regularus penkiakampis needs to be turned to return to his original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a pentagon. A pentagon has five sides, and each step corresponds to a rotation by an angle equal to \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

We need to find the smallest number of steps \( n \) such that the total rotation \( 72^\circ \times n \) is a multiple of \( 360^\circ \). This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 72n \equiv 0 \pmod{360} \]

To solve this, we divide both sides of the congruence by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 360. The GCD of 72 and 360 is 72. So, we have:
\[ n \equiv 0 \pmod{\frac{360}{72}} \]
\[ n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \]

This means that \( n \) must be a multiple of 5. The smallest positive multiple of 5 is 5 itself. Therefore, the minimum number of steps regularus penkiakampis needs to be turned to return to his original position is:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 6 \) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering another pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonals \( AB \) and \( CD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, specifically \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). However, we need to adjust the middle term to match this form. Instead, let's consider the expression in a different way.

Notice that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1 = 100^2 - 1 + 1 = 100^2.\]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the maximum value of the ratio \(\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) over all non-zero vectors \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's express \(\|\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v}\|\) in terms of the components of \(\bold{v}\). If \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\), then
\[
A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The norm of \( A\mathbf{v} \) is
\[
\|A\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]
The norm of \(\mathbf{v}\) is
\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
We need to find the maximum value of the expression
\[
\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}}.
\]
Let \( t = \frac{x}{y} \). Then \( x = ty \), and the expression becomes
\[
\sqrt{\frac{4(ty)^2 + 12(ty)y + 13y^2}{(ty)^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2y^2 + 12ty^2 + 13y^2}{t^2y^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{y^2(4t^2 + 12t + 13)}{y^2(t^2 + 1)}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}}.
\]
We need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(t) = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}} \). To do this, we first find the maximum value of the function \( g(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} \). We take the derivative of \( g(t) \) and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[
g'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 - 8t^3 - 24t^2 - 26t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-12t^2 - 18t + 12}{(t^2 + 1)^2}.
\]
Setting \( g'(t) = 0 \), we get
\[
-12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \implies 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \):
\[
t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}.
\]
This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \). We evaluate \( g(t) \) at these points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):
\[
g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 13}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 16,
\]
\[
g(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = 1,

\[
\lim_{t \to \pm \infty} g(t) = \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} = 4.

The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10.**

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"Let's define the variables for the weights of the treekai, skvygai, and guli:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of one treekai.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of one skvyga.
- Let \( g \) be the weight of one guli.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( 3t = 2s + g \)
2. \( 2t + g = s \)

We need to find the values of \( t \) and \( s \) in terms of \( g \). Let's start by solving the second equation for \( s \):
\[ s = 2t + g \]

Next, substitute this expression for \( s \) into the first equation:
\[ 3t = 2(2t + g) + g \]
\[ 3t = 4t + 2g + g \]
\[ 3t = 4t + 3g \]
\[ 3t - 4t = 3g \]
\[ -t = 3g \]
\[ t = -3g \]

Now substitute \( t = -3g \) back into the expression for \( s \):
\[ s = 2(-3g) + g \]
\[ s = -6g + g \]
\[ s = -5g \]

So, the weight of one treekai is \( -3g \) and the weight of one skvyga is \( -5g \). This means that the weight of one treekai is 3 times the negative weight of one guli, and the weight of one skvyga is 5 times the negative weight of one guli. Therefore, the weight of one treekai is 3 times the weight of one skvyga.

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expanded polynomial must be equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. For \(t^4\):
\[

2. For \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26

3. For \(t^2\):
\[

\]

4. For \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. For the constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

First, solve for \(a\) from the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = \frac{6}{-2} = -3
\]

Next, substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 26 - 20 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To find the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the information given about the rate at which the volume of water is increasing and the rate at which the water level is rising.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We are given that the volume of water is increasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per valand. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

We are also given that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per valand. This can be written as:

To find the radius \( r \), we use the relationship between the rates of change of volume and height. By differentiating the volume formula with respect to time \( t \), we get:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

1. **Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\):**
   \[
   f(x) = ax^2
   \]
   This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin \((0, 0)\). For \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) is increasing because the coefficient \(a\) is positive. The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval occurs at \(x = a\):
   \[
   f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3
   \]
   Therefore, for \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) \geq a^3\).

2. **Analyze the function for \(x < a\):**
   \[
   f(x) = ax + 2a
   \]
   This is a linear function with a positive slope \(a\). For \(x < a\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is increasing. The value of \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a

   Therefore, for \(x < a\), \(f(x) < a^2 + 2a\).

3. **Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line at most once:**
   For the function \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at most once, the value \(a^3\) (the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\)) must be less than or equal to the value \(a^2 + 2a\) (the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\)):

   Solve the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) by determining the intervals where the product is non-positive. The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\).

Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms in the given equation.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constant terms:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange the equation to isolate the completed squares on one side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for solutions where \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the cubic equation.

By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots of the cubic equation are the factors of the constant term \(\lambda^2 - 1\) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient \(-\lambda^4\). The possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{\lambda}, \pm \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda^2}\).

Let's test \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}.
\]
Then,
\[
f\left(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) = f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left(\frac{4 - \lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2 (4 - \lambda)}{16}.
\]
We need this to equal \(\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
\frac{\lambda^2 (4 - \lambda)}{16} = \frac{1}{2} \implies \lambda^2 (4 - \lambda) = 8 \implies 4\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 = 8 \implies \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0.
\]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem again to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8\). Testing \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0.
\]
So, \(\lambda = 2\) is a root. We can factor \(\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8\) as:
\[

"To find the value of \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
To simplify this, we can use the identity \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression can be rewritten using the tangent of a sum or difference of angles. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
This is already in a form that suggests a tangent of a specific angle. By inspection or using known angle values, we find that:
\[
\tan 35^\circ = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Therefore, \(\theta = 35^\circ\).

"To determine how many ways the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" can be arranged, we need to consider the fact that some of the letters are repeated. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 8 letters where the letter ""E"" appears 4 times, the letter ""L"" appears 2 times, and the letters ""I"" and ""P"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- \( n = 8 \) (total letters)
- \( n_1 = 4 \) (for ""E"")
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (for ""L"")
- \( n_3 = 1 \) (for ""I"")
- \( n_4 = 1 \) (for ""P"")

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{8!}{4! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320 \)
- \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \)

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

\[
\frac{40320}{24 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = \frac{40320}{48} = 840

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is:

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(0, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y \]
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = x \]
The maximum value of \( y \) and \( x \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1.

Next, let's consider the interior of the domain. To find the critical points, we need to take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Multiplying both sides by \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we obtain:
\[ \sqrt{(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2)} = xy \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]
This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) as \( y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

Substituting \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into the function \( f(x, y) \), we get:
\[ f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x \sqrt{1 - (\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} + (1 - x^2) = x \sqrt{x^2} + (1 - x^2) = x |x| + (1 - x^2) \]
If \( x \ge 0 \), then \( |x| = x \), so:
\[ f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x^2 + 1 - x^2 = 1 \]
If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \), so:
\[ f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x(-x) + 1 - x^2 = -x^2 + 1 - x^2 = 1 - 2x^2 \]
The maximum value of \( 1 - 2x^2 \) occurs when \( x^2 = 0 \), which gives \( f(x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}) = 1 \).

Similarly, substituting \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into the function \( f(x, y) \), we get:
\[ f(x, -\sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x \sqrt{1 - (-\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2} + (-\sqrt{1 - x^2}) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} - (1 - x^2) = x \sqrt{x^2} - (1 - x^2) = x |x| - (1 - x^2) \]
If \( x \ge 0 \), then \( |x| = x \), so:
\[ f(x, -\sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x^2 - 1 + x^2 = 2x^2 - 1 \]
The maximum value of \( 2x^2 - 1 \) occurs when \( x^2 = 1 \), which gives \( f(x, -\sqrt{1 - x^2}) = 2(1) - 1 = 1 \).
If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \), so:
\[ f(x, -\sqrt{1 - x^2}) = x(-x) - 1 + x^2 = -x^2 - 1 + x^2 = -1 \]

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[

\[

We can express \( z \) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{i\cdot17\pi} = e^{i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{i\pi} = (e^{i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{-i\pi} = (e^{-i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore,

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), it divides the triangle \(ABC\) into two smaller triangles, \(AMN\) and \(MNC\), and a trapezoid \(BMNC\). The triangle \(AMN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) and the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the base and from the vertex to the base. Since \(G\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its side lengths. Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

The area of the trapezoid \(BMNC\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\):
\[
\text{Area of } BMNC = 144 - 64 = 80.
\]

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, the line \(MN\) divides the trapezoid \(BMNC\) into two smaller trapezoids, \(BMGM\) and \(GNCM\), of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these trapezoids is:
\[
\text{Area of } BMGM = \text{Area of } GNCM = \frac{80}{2} = 40.
\]

The triangle \(eng\) is similar to triangle \(BGC\) and the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the distances from \(G\) to \(BC\) and from \(G\) to \(BC\), which is 1:1. Therefore, the area of triangle \(eng\) is equal to the area of triangle \(BGC\).

Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides triangle \(BGC\) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \(BGC\) is three times the area of triangle \(eng\). Let the area of triangle \(eng\) be \(x\). Then:
\[

The fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) to make the denominator a power of 10.

"To determine how many penkcentifiers Hillary has, we start by defining the variables for the number of dimes and penkcentifiers. Let \( d \) be the number of dimes and \( p \) be the number of penkcentifiers. According to the problem, the total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since each dime is worth 10 cents and each penkcentifier is worth 5 cents, we can write the following equation:

\[ 10d + 5p = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ 2d + p = 15 \]

This equation tells us that the number of penkcentifiers \( p \) is equal to 15 minus twice the number of dimes \( d \). Since \( d \) and \( p \) must be non-negative integers, we need to find the possible values for \( d \) that make \( p \) a non-negative integer. Let's test the possible values for \( d \):

- If \( d = 0 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 0 = 15 \).
- If \( d = 1 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 1 = 13 \).
- If \( d = 2 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 2 = 11 \).
- If \( d = 3 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 \).
- If \( d = 4 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 4 = 7 \).
- If \( d = 5 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 5 = 5 \).
- If \( d = 6 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 6 = 3 \).
- If \( d = 7 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 7 = 1 \).
- If \( d = 8 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 8 = -1 \), which is not a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the possible values for \( p \) are 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1. Since the problem does not specify the exact number of dimes, any of these values for \( p \) would satisfy the equation. However, without additional information, we can only conclude that the number of penkcentifiers Hillary has is one of these values. If we assume the problem is asking for a specific answer based on typical coin combinations, we can choose one of these values. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the most straightforward solution where \( d = 0 \) and \( p = 15 \).

Thus, the number of penkcentifiers Hillary has is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen distinct prime numbers from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. They are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if and only if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and the rest are odd numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

We calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct prime numbers from these 6 prime numbers. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 6\) and \(k = 2\):

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even. This can happen in two ways:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.

Since there is only one even number, there are no ways to choose 2 even numbers from the set. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from the 5 odd numbers is:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 favorable outcomes. The probability that the sum of two randomly chosen distinct prime numbers from the first six prime numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even is \(\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}\).","[2/3, '\\frac{2}{3}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To find the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \). This will give us \( 3(4) + 2y = 12 \).
2. Simplify the left side of the equation: \( 3(4) = 12 \), so the equation becomes \( 12 + 2y = 12 \).
3. Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( y \): \( 12 + 2y - 12 = 12 - 12 \), which simplifies to \( 2y = 0 \).
4. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( y \): \( \frac{2y}{2} = \frac{0}{2} \), which simplifies to \( y = 0 \).

"To determine the area of the shaded region in the given diagram, we need to analyze the structure of the square and the triangles formed within it.

1. **Identify the side length of the square:**
   The square is divided into smaller units by horizontal and vertical lines. From the diagram, we can see that the square is divided into 4 equal horizontal segments and 5 equal vertical segments. Therefore, the side length of the square is:
   \[
   4 \text{ units} \times 5 \text{ units} = 20 \text{ units}

   The area \(A\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}

"To determine the number of four-digit positive integers that consist only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to consider the structure of such numbers. A four-digit number has four positions, and each position can be either 0 or 1. However, the first digit cannot be 0 because then it would not be a four-digit number.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the choices for each digit:**
   - The first digit can be either 1 (it cannot be 0).
   - The second digit can be either 0 or 1.
   - The third digit can be either 0 or 1.
   - The fourth digit can be either 0 or 1.

2. **Calculate the total number of possible combinations:**
   - For the first digit, there is 1 choice (1).
   - For the second digit, there are 2 choices (0 or 1).
   - For the third digit, there are 2 choices (0 or 1).
   - For the fourth digit, there are 2 choices (0 or 1).

   Therefore, the total number of four-digit numbers that can be formed is:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x

In this case, let \(x = 20^\circ\). Then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin (60^\circ - 20^\circ) \sin (60^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin (3 \cdot 20^\circ) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}

"To determine the form of the surface described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates:

- \( \theta \) represents the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane, measured from the positive \( x \)-axis.
- \( z \) represents the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is constant for all points on the surface. This implies that the surface is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions.

To visualize this, consider the following:
- For any fixed value of \( z = c \), the coordinates \( (r, \theta) \) can take any value in the \( xy \)-plane.
- This means that for each fixed \( z = c \), the set of points \((r, \theta, c)\) forms a circle in the plane parallel to the \( xy \)-plane.
- Since \( z \) is constant, the surface is a plane that cuts through the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by determining the roots of \( g(x) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we have:

\[ g(x) = 0 \implies f(x + 5) = 0. \]

This means that the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( x + 5 \) is a root of \( f(x) \). If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15. \]

Next, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by:

\[ -\frac{a_2}{a_3}. \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have \( a_3 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = -49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:

\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

However, we already know that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\), so we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

This implies that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\).

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles, excluding one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(A\) be the measure of the excluded angle. Therefore, the total sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + A

3. **Substitute the formula for \(S\) into the equation:**
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + A
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for \(A\):**
   Since \(A\) is an interior angle of a polygon, it must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
   \[
   0 < A < 180^\circ

5. **Set up inequalities to find the range for \(n\):**
   Substitute the bounds of \(A\) into the equation:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ

6. **Solve the inequalities for \(n\):**
   First, divide all parts of the inequality by \(180^\circ\):

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the equation:

\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[

\]
We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
In our equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}

\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the expression for \( t \), we get:

   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:

   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we can set up the equation:

   Each face of a cube is a square. The area \( A \) of a square is given by the formula:

\[ S_n = n^2 \]

In this problem, \( n = 2003 \). Therefore, we substitute 2003 for \( n \) in the formula:

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

"To determine the average cost of Juan's \(70\)'s dešimtmečio paštoženklų kaina in centais, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of paštoženklų Juan has in the \(70\)'s for each country.
2. Calculate the total cost for each country by multiplying the number of paštoženklų by the cost per paštoženklis.
3. Sum the total costs for all countries.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of paštoženklų to find the average cost.

Let's start with the given data:

- Brazil: 12 paštoženklų at \(6\) centus each
- France: 12 paštoženklų at \(4\) centus each
- Peru: 6 paštoženklų at \(4\) centus each
- Spain: 13 paštoženklų at \(5\) centus each

First, calculate the total cost for each country:

- Brazil: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) centus
- France: \(12 \times 4 = 48\) centus
- Peru: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) centus
- Spain: \(13 \times 5 = 65\) centus

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezium with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar by the Angle Bisector Theorem. This implies that the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides \(AD\) and \(BC\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

The area of trapezium \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\). Thus, we can write:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42
\]

Let \( [\triangle ACD] = x \). Then \( [\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{a} x \). Substituting these into the area equation, we get:
\[
x + \frac{b}{a} x = 42
\]
\[
x \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
x \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
x = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(a\) and \(b\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]

We need to find the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem in \(\triangle ABD\). The Angle Bisector Theorem states that:
\[
\frac{BD}{DA} = \frac{BC}{CD} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

Let \(BD = y\). Then:
\[
\frac{y}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
\[
y = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The length of \(AB\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = d^2 + b^2
\]

The length of \(AB\) can also be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABD\):
\[
AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 = a^2 + \left(\frac{ab}{c}\right)^2 = a^2 + \frac{a^2b^2}{c^2}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(AB^2\), we get:
\[
d^2 + b^2 = a^2 + \frac{a^2b^2}{c^2}
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(d\) is the hypotenuse of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
d^2 = a^2 + c^2
\]

Substituting \(d^2 = a^2 + c^2\) into the equation, we get:
\[
a^2 + c^2 + b^2 = a^2 + \frac{a^2b^2}{c^2}
\]
\[
c^2 + b^2 = \frac{a^2b^2}{c^2}
\]
\[
c^4 + b^2c^2 = a^2b^2
\]
\[
c^4 = a^2b^2 - b^2c^2
\]
\[
c^4 = b^2(a^2 - c^2)
\]
\[
c^2 = b^2 \left(\frac{a^2 - c^2}{c^2}\right)
\]
\[
c^2 = b^2 \left(\frac{a^2}{c^2} - 1\right)
\]
\[
c^2 = b^2 \left(\frac{a^2 - c^2}{c^2}\right)

\[
c^2 = b^2 \left(\frac{a^2}{c^2} - 1\right)

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   -19x = -9

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}}

   Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the operation, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( m \) and \( p \):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30}

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factor of 10 in the numerator and the denominator:

\[

Now, we perform the division \(\frac{21}{3}\):

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen at random on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. For two line segments to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points is on one side of the circle and the other pair is on the other side.

2. **Count the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (to account for the rotational symmetry) and by 2 (to account for the reflectional symmetry). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   But this is incorrect because we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and then the remaining 2 points to form the second segment. The correct approach is to consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, which is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\), and then the remaining 2 points automatically form the second segment. However, each pair of segments can be arranged in 2 ways (either \(AB\) and \(CD\) or \(CD\) and \(AB\)), so we need to divide by 2. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
   But this is incorrect because we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and then the remaining 2 points to form the second segment.

However, each pair of segments can be arranged in 2 ways (either \(AB\) and \(CD\) or \(CD\) and \(AB\), so we need to divide by 2. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points is on one side of the circle and the other pair is on the other side. There are 2 such arrangements (either \(A\) and \(B\) are on one side and \(C\) and \(D\) are on the other side, or \(C\) and \(D\) are on one side and \(A\) and \(B\) are on the other side).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

3. **Determine the area of the region formed by the two circles:**
   According to the problem, the area of the region formed by the two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) times the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area \(A_{\text{region}}\) of the region is:
   \[
   A_{\text{region}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Express the area of the region in terms of the angles:**
   The region formed by the two circles consists of two circular segments. The area of each segment can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circular segment:
   \[
   A_{\text{segment}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 - \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin \theta
   \]
   where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees.

   For the larger circle with radius 2:
   \[
   A_{\text{segment, large}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi - \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \sin \theta = \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \pi - 2 \sin \theta

   For the smaller circle with radius 1:
   \[
   A_{\text{segment, small}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi - \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \sin \theta = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
   \]

5. **Set up the equation for the total area of the region:**
   The total area of the region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
   \[
   A_{\text{region}} = A_{\text{segment, large}} + A_{\text{segment, small}} = \left( \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \pi - 2 \sin \theta \right) + \left( \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta \right)
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   Combine the terms involving \(\pi\) and \(\sin \theta\):
   \[
   A_{\text{region}} = \left( \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} + \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \right) \pi - \left( 2 + \frac{1}{2} \right) \sin \theta

   \[
   A_{\text{region}} = \left( \frac{4\theta}{360^\circ} + \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \right) \pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta
   \]
   \[
   A_{\text{region}} = \frac{5\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta
   \]
   \[
   A_{\text{region}} = \frac{\theta}{72^\circ} \pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta
   \]

7. **Set the equation equal to the given area:**
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{72^\circ} \pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

8. **Solve for \(\theta\):**
   First, isolate the term involving \(\pi\):
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{72^\circ} \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3} + \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(\pi\):
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{72^\circ} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{5}{2\pi} \sin \theta
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 72:
   \[
   \theta = 120^\circ + \frac{5 \times 72}{2\pi} \sin \theta
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \theta = 120^\circ + \frac{360}{2\pi} \sin \theta
   \]
   \[
   \theta = 120^\circ + \frac{180}{\pi} \sin \theta

"To determine how many cylindrical mugs are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical mug and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical mug. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical mug, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2

\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 respublikonai + 6 demokratai) is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that consists only of respublikonai or only of demokratai.**

- The number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee consisting only of respublikonai is \(\binom{8}{5}\):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

- The number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee consisting only of demokratai is \(\binom{6}{5}\):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that includes at least one member from each party.**

This is done by subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists only of respublikonai or only of demokratai from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:

\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee, where at least one member comes from each party, is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[a - b = 513 - 487 = 26\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000\]

Now, we substitute these values into the difference of squares formula:
\[513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000\]

Therefore, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is \(\boxed{26000}\).","[26000, '26000']",26000,"[26000, '26000']",True
"Let's denote the three integers by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). According to the problem, the sum of these integers is 120, so we have:

\[a + b + c = 120\]

The average of these three integers is given as 24. The average of three numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 3, so we can write:

\[\frac{a + b + c}{3} = 24\]

Multiplying both sides of this equation by 3, we get:

\[a + b + c = 72\]

However, we already know from the first equation that \(a + b + c = 120\). This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a need to recheck the conditions. But if we consider the problem statement correctly, we need to find the correct interpretation.

Let's assume the problem meant the average of the three numbers is 24 after some operation or different context. But if we consider the problem as it is given, we need to recheck the conditions again.

Let's assume the problem means the average of the three numbers is 24 after some operation or different context. But if we consider the problem as it is given, we need to recheck the conditions again.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root. We do this by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

We solve these two equations separately. For the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64
\]

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

\[
x = 66
\]

For the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64
\]

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

\[
x = -62
\]

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \(x = 66\) and \(x = -62\). We can write the final answer as:

\[
\boxed{66 \text{ and } -62}

"To find the value of the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is given by:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. To do this, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.
\]

This product includes \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\). We know that \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \right) \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right).
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{8} \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right).
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{128}.
\]

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we know that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

We are also given that there is a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Then \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \theta\).

Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we have \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\). Now, consider \(\triangle BDC\). Since \(D\) is on \(AM\), \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). We can use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDC\):

\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC)
\]

Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(AB = AC\)), we have:

\[
(2x)^2 = 2BD^2 - 2 \cdot BD^2 \cdot \cos(6\theta)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4x^2 = 2BD^2(1 - \cos(6\theta))
\]

\[
2x^2 = BD^2(1 - \cos(6\theta))
\]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ABD\):

\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AD \cdot \cos(\angle BAD)
\]

Since \(AB = AC\) and \(\angle BAD = \theta\), we have:

\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + 10^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot 10 \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]

\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + 100 - 20AB \cos(\theta)
\]

We also know that \(AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2\). Substituting this into the equation for \(BD^2\), we get:

\[
BD^2 = 121 + x^2 + 100 - 20AB \cos(\theta)
\]

\[
BD^2 = 221 + x^2 - 20AB \cos(\theta)
\]

Now, substitute \(BD^2\) into the equation \(2x^2 = BD^2(1 - \cos(6\theta))\):

\[
2x^2 = (221 + x^2 - 20AB \cos(\theta))(1 - \cos(6\theta))
\]

We use the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(6\theta) = 4\cos^3(2\theta) - 3\cos(2\theta)\). Since \(\cos(2\theta) = \frac{AB^2 - AM^2}{AB^2} = \frac{121 + x^2 - 121}{121 + x^2} = \frac{x^2}{121 + x^2}\), we have:

\[
\cos(6\theta) = 4\left(\frac{x^2}{121 + x^2}\right)^3 - 3\left(\frac{x^2}{121 + x^2}\right)
\]

Substituting this into the equation, we get a complex expression. However, by solving this equation or using geometric properties, we find that \(x = 11\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 22\).

The length of \(AB\) is:

\[
AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}
\]

The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{2} + 11\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22(\sqrt{2} + 1)

Thus, the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

"To find the median of the sum of the first 27 positive integers, we start by calculating the sum itself. The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:

For \( n = 27 \), the sum is:

\[

It appears there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. However, if we interpret the problem as finding the median of the first 27 positive integers, we proceed as follows:

The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. For a set with an odd number of elements, the median is the element in the middle position. Since there are 27 numbers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence of the first 27 positive integers. The sequence of the first 27 positive integers is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, let's make a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, -7) \), \( (-7, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \). However, since \(y = x^2 \geq 0\), we only need to test the interval \( [0, 3) \).

For \(0 \leq y < 3\), we can choose a test point, say \(y = 1\):
\[ (1)^2 + 4(1) - 21 = 1 + 4 - 21 = -16 \]
Since \(-16 < 0\), the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is true for \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Thus, we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Combining the results from both steps, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the system of equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(s\) and \(p\) using the identity:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3sp.
\]
Since \(sp = 24\), we substitute \(24\) for \(sp\) in the equation:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3 \cdot 24,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
or
\[
s^3 = 64.
\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now that we have \(s = 4\), we can find \(p\) using the equation \(sp = 24\):
\[
4p = 24,
\]
so
\[
p = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has a ratio of the number of boy students to the number of girl students that is closest to \(135\%\), we need to calculate the ratio for each class and compare it to \(135\%\).

First, let's convert \(135\%\) to a decimal:
\[
135\% = 1.35
\]

Next, we calculate the ratio of boy students to girl students for each class.

**For the \(9^{\text{a}}\) class:**
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{41.1\%}{39.4\%} = \frac{0.411}{0.394} \approx 1.043
\]

**For the \(10^{\text{a}}\) class:**
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{34.4\%}{33.1\%} = \frac{0.344}{0.331} \approx 1.039
\]

**For the \(11^{\text{a}}\) class:**
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{20.6\%}{13.8\%} = \frac{0.206}{0.138} \approx 1.485
\]

**For the \(12^{\text{a}}\) class:**
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{11.6\%}{8.6\%} = \frac{0.116}{0.086} \approx 1.349
\]

Now, we compare each ratio to \(1.35\):

- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{a}}\) class is \(1.043\), which is \(1.35 - 1.043 = 0.307\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{a}}\) class is \(1.039\), which is \(1.35 - 1.039 = 0.311\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{a}}\) class is \(1.485\), which is \(1.485 - 1.35 = 0.135\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(12^{\text{a}}\) class is \(1.349\), which is \(1.35 - 1.349 = 0.001\) away from \(1.35\).

The smallest difference is \(0.001\), which corresponds to the \(12^{\text{a}}\) class.

Therefore, the class with the ratio of boy students to girl students closest to \(135\%\) is the \(\boxed{12^{\text{a}}}\) class.","[135*(1/100), '12^{']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x - 9)(x + 9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor out an \(x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x - 36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals where the denominator is not zero (i.e., \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\)). We will consider the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\).

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\).

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) < 0\) (since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\).

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) < 0\) (since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\).

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are positive).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\).

From the analysis above, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), we exclude these points from the solution set.

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircular arcs, one at each end of the rectangle. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width of the rectangle by \( w \). The two straight sides of the rectangle each have a length \( l \), and the two semicircular arcs each have a radius \( w/2 \). The circumference of a full circle with radius \( w/2 \) is \( \pi w \), so the total length of the two semicircular arcs is \( \pi w \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the two semicircular arcs:
\[
2l + \pi w = 400

We can solve this equation for \( l \):
\[
2l = 400 - \pi w

\[

\[
A = l \cdot w = \left(200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}\right) w = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0
\]
Solving for \( w \):
\[
\pi w = 200
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{\pi}

\[
A = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by identifying the sides of the triangle relative to angle \(R\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) means that the side opposite angle \(R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Given that \(RT = 5\) and \(RS = 2\), we need to find the length of the side \(ST\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2

Substituting the known values:
\[

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we have:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}

Expanding \((x^2 - 3)^2\), we get:

\]
To find the minimum value of \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]
Setting \(f'(x) = 0\), we get:
\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0 \implies 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
This gives us three critical points: \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]

\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) with the given distances from \( P \) to \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) being 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and \( x \) respectively. We need to determine the value of \( x \).

First, recall that in a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This is a known geometric property of regular polyhedra. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

Next, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:

\[
3^2 = 9
\]
\[
7^2 = 49
\]
\[
8^2 = 64
\]
\[
9^2 = 81
\]
\[
11^2 = 121
\]

Adding these values together:

\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant, we need to find the value of this constant. However, we can use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to the vertices is equal to four times the square of the circumradius \( R \) of the octahedron.

For a regular octahedron with edge length \( a \), the circumradius \( R \) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

The edge length \( a \) of the octahedron can be determined from the given distances. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. Therefore, we can use the property directly without calculating \( R \).

Given that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant, we can use the property to find \( x \). Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to four times the square of the circumradius \( R \), we can use the property to find \( x \).

Finally, we find that the value of \( x \) is:

"To determine the ratio of Jen's Kamoli pagrees to Jack's Kamoli pagrees, we start by using the given formula for the force of gravity, which states that the force is proportional to the mass of the object. Let's denote the force of gravity on Jen's Kamoli as \( F_J \) and the force of gravity on Jack's Kamoli as \( F_{Jack} \). According to the formula, we have:

\[ F_J = m_J \cdot g \]
\[ F_{Jack} = m_{Jack} \cdot g \]

where \( m_J \) is the mass of Jen's Kamoli, \( m_{Jack} \) is the mass of Jack's Kamoli, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the acceleration due to gravity \( g \) is the same for both Kamoli, we can simplify the ratio of the forces as follows:

\[ \frac{F_J}{F_{Jack}} = \frac{m_J \cdot g}{m_{Jack} \cdot g} = \frac{m_J}{m_{Jack}} \]

We are given that the mass of Jen's Kamoli is 200 grams and the mass of Jack's Kamoli is 150 grams. Substituting these values into the ratio, we get:

\[ \frac{F_J}{F_{Jack}} = \frac{200}{150} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Therefore, the ratio of Jen's Kamoli pagrees to Jack's Kamoli pagrees is \(\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}\).","[4/3, '\\frac{4}{3}']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine the common digit in the base-7 and base-8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base-7 and base-8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base-7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base-7 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base-8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base-8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

**Step 3: Identify the common digit in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

We compare the digits of \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):
- \(1556_7\) has the digits: 1, 5, 5, 6
- \(1165_8\) has the digits: 1, 1, 6, 5

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. The smallest common digit is 1.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and analyze the given conditions step by step.

Let \( r \) be the number of rAGmos and \( b \) be the number of burtininkai. According to the problem, each rAGos passes out rankos to each burtininkas, and each burtininkas passes out rankos to each rAGos. This means that the total number of rankos passed out is \( r \times b \) from the rAGmos to the burtininkai and \( b \times r \) from the burtininkai to the rAGos. Therefore, the total number of rankos passed out is:

\[ r \times b + b \times r = 2rb \]

We are also given that no rAGos nesivatino pass out rankos to any burtininkas, which means that each rAGos passes out rankos to all burtininkai, and each burtininkas passes out rankos to all rAGos. This confirms that the total number of rankos passed out is indeed \( 2rb \).

Since the problem does not provide specific values for \( r \) and \( b \), the answer must be in terms of \( r \) and \( b \). Therefore, the total number of rankos that passed out is:

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \):

\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):

"To find the distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\).

Starting with \(y = 2x - 2\), we can rearrange it as:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Now, we substitute these values into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}

Simplify the numerator and the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{|12 + 0 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Therefore, the distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\[

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2, t = 1 + i, t = 1 - i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

   \[
   3p + 2t = 1.24
   \]

2. The cost of five piešukai and two didelis trintukas is $1.82:
   \[
   5p + 2t = 1.82
   \]

To eliminate \( t \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + 2t) - (3p + 2t) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2p = 0.58

Solving for \( p \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[

So, the cost of one piešukai is $0.29. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

Now, we multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{100}\):
\[

\]

Thus, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

To find the sum of the digits to the right of the decimal point, we add the digits 2, 7, and 4:

Therefore, the sum of the digits to the right of the decimal point is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is either inside the circle centered at \(O\) or inside any of the four quarter-circles centered at the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to calculate the areas of these regions and then find the ratio of the area of the union of these regions to the area of the rectangle.

First, let's denote the length of \(AB\) as \(a\) and the length of \(AD\) as \(b\). The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = a \times b
\]

The radius of the circle centered at \(O\) is \(\frac{a}{2}\) (since \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AB\)). The area of this circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the circle} = \pi \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi a^2}{4}
\]

Next, consider the quarter-circles centered at the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Each quarter-circle has a radius equal to the distance from the center to the vertex, which is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}\). The area of one quarter-circle is:
\[
\text{Area of one quarter-circle} = \frac{1}{4} \pi \left(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (a^2 + b^2)}{16}
\]

Since there are four quarter-circles, the total area of the four quarter-circles is:
\[
\text{Total area of the four quarter-circles} = 4 \times \frac{\pi (a^2 + b^2)}{16} = \frac{\pi (a^2 + b^2)}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find the area of the union of the circle centered at \(O\) and the four quarter-circles. Notice that the circle centered at \(O\) and the four quarter-circles together cover the entire rectangle \(ABCD\) without any overlap. Therefore, the area of the union is simply the sum of the area of the circle and the area of the four quarter-circles:
\[
\text{Area of the union} = \frac{\pi a^2}{4} + \frac{\pi (a^2 + b^2)}{4} = \frac{\pi a^2 + \pi a^2 + \pi b^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (2a^2 + b^2)}{4}
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is either inside the circle centered at \(O\) or inside any of the four quarter-circles is the ratio of the area of the union to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{\pi (2a^2 + b^2)}{4}}{a \times b} = \frac{\pi (2a^2 + b^2)}{4ab}
\]

Given that \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\), we have \(a = kb\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the probability expression, we get:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\pi (2(kb)^2 + b^2)}{4(kb)b} = \frac{\pi (2k^2b^2 + b^2)}{4k b^2} = \frac{\pi b^2 (2k^2 + 1)}{4k b^2} = \frac{\pi (2k^2 + 1)}{4k}
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is either inside the circle centered at \(O\) or inside any of the four quarter-circles is:

"To solve the problem of finding \(54 \mod 6\), we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Here are the steps to find the solution:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9
   \]
   This means that 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9.

2. Since the quotient is an integer (9), we can express 54 as:
   \[
   54 = 6 \times 9 + 0
   \]
   Here, the remainder is 0.

3. Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. In other words, \(54 \mod 6 = 0\).

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total after paring their savings, we first need to add their individual amounts together. The amounts are as follows:

Linda: \$27.47
Sherry: \$35.23
June: \$37.37
 Connie: \$26.52

We can add these amounts step by step:

First, add Linda's and Sherry's amounts:
\[27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70\]

Next, add June's amount to the result:
\[62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07\]

Finally, add Connie's amount to the result:
\[100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59\]

So, the total amount of money they have after paring their savings is \$126.59. To find out how much this is in dollars and cents, we see that it is 126 dollars and 59 cents. Therefore, the number of cents they have is:

"To find the arithmetic mean of the test scores, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of all the test scores.
2. Divide the total sum by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the test scores. We know that:
- 20 mokinių gavo 80 points each.
- 8 mokinių gavo 90 points each.
- 2 mokinių gavo 100 points each.

So, the total sum of the scores is:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplications:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Next, we add these products together:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of students, which is 30:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) grid where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on these conditions.

First, let's write down the sums of each row, each column, and each diagonal:

1. **Sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
   \]

2. **Sum of the second row:**
   \[
   (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

3. **Sum of the third row:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
   \]

4. **Sum of the first column:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

5. **Sum of the second column:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
   \]

6. **Sum of the third column:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
   \]

7. **Sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):**
   \[
   (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13
   \]

8. **Sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):**
   \[
   (n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 3n - 6
   \]

Since all these sums must be equal, we set the common sum \( S \) equal to any of these expressions. Let's use \( 2n + 1 \) for simplicity:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:

\[
1 = n - 6
\]

Add 6 to both sides:

\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the grid and check the sums:

- **First row:**
  \[
  (7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
  \]

- **Second row:**
  \[
  (7+2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
  \]

- **Third row:**
  \[
  2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
  \]

- **First column:**
  \[
  (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]

- **Second column:**
  \[
  3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]

- **Third column:**
  \[
  (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]

- **Main diagonal:**
  \[
  (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]

- **Other diagonal:**
  \[
  (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
  \]

All sums are equal to 15, confirming that \( n = 7 \) is correct.

"To determine how many more pths Džima uses than Marta, we need to calculate the perimeter and the area of the rectangular field and then find the difference between these two values.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the rectangular field. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the field is 400 pths and the width is 300 pths, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ pths} \]

Next, let's calculate the area of the rectangular field. The formula for the area \( A \) of a rectangle is:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the length of the field is 400 pths and the width is 300 pths, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ A = 400 \times 300 = 120000 \text{ square pths} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the perimeter and the area:
\[ \text{Difference} = 1400 - 120000 = -118600 \text{ pths} \]

Since the question asks how many more pths Džima uses than Marta, and the result is negative, it means Marta uses more pths than Džima. The absolute value of the difference is:
\[ 118600 \text{ pths} \]

Therefore, Marta uses \(\boxed{118600}\) more pths than Džima.","[118600, '118600']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). They satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can substitute \(\omega + \omega^2\) with \(-1\):
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\) and the fact that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
