"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit. Therefore, the total number of ways is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table ronde such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 10^2 x^{6} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{-6}
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 100 x^6 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) x^{-6}
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right)

\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{25}{2}\right)

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 8 - 7 = 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, multiply the numbers:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

So,

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to coincide with its original position, we need to consider the properties of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides (which is 5 in this case).

The angle of rotation that brings the pentagon back to its original position is given by:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]
This means that the pentagon will coincide with its original position after a rotation of 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and a full rotation of 360 degrees. The smallest of these angles is 72 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated until it coincides with its original position is:

"Given the coordinates of a parallelogram \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\) with \(x > 7\), we need to determine the value of \(x + y\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let's consider the diagonals formed by the given points and the unknown point \((x, y)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid. Let's consider the possibility that the diagonals are not necessarily those we initially assumed. Instead, let's consider the diagonals connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\), and \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Setting these midpoints equal gives us:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Since \(x = 8\) and \(y = 9\) satisfy the condition \(x > 7\), the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"Given the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). We need to find the value of \(\tan A\).

First, recall the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

We are given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). Substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:
\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is defined for all angles except where \(\cos A = 0\), which is not the case here), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\tan A = 2

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. First, we factor the denominator:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
\]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the potential vertical asymptotes:

\[
(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \), we find:

\[
x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
\]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Horizontal Asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

- If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
- If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of the numerator}}{\text{leading coefficient of the denominator}} \).
- If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In our function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is:

\[
y = 0
\]

Thus, \( c = 0 \).

### Sum of the Asymptotes
Now, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) de头, we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, specifically \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). However, we need to adjust the middle term to match. Instead, let's consider the expression in a different form by adding and subtracting 1:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1.\]

This is not directly useful, so let's try another approach. Instead, let's use the fact that \(99 = 100 - 1\):
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = (100 - 1)^2 + (100 - 1) + 1.\]

Now, expand \((100 - 1)^2\):
\[(100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.\]

So the expression becomes:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1.\]

Now, add these numbers together:
\[9801 + 99 = 9900,\]
\[9900 + 1 = 9901.\]

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{10000}\).","[10000, '10000']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",False
"To find the smallest positive number \( C \) such that

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Multiplying through by \( xy \) to clear the denominators, we obtain

\[
4xy + 6y^2 = 6x^2 + 13xy \implies 6y^2 - 6x^2 = 9xy \implies 2y^2 - 2x^2 = 3xy \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{(-3x)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2x^2)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{25x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{8x}{4} = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-2x}{4} = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

We substitute these solutions back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. If \( y = 2x \), then

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. If \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \), then

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{4x^2 + x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we start by examining the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. This can be expressed mathematically as:

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we can follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\).**

The base \(9\) number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\).**

The base \(9\) number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}.\]

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**

Now, subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base \(9\).**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"Let's define the weights of the treeks, squigs, and goolees as follows:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of a treek.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of a squig.
- Let \( g \) be the weight of a goolee.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Dix treeks pèsent autant que trois squigs et un goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   10t = 3s + g
   \]
2. Deux treeks et un goolee sont égaux en weight à un squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2t + g = s
   \]

We need to find the weight of one squig in terms of the weight of a treek, i.e., we need to express \( s \) in terms of \( t \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = s - 2t
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[
10t = 3s + (s - 2t)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
10t = 4s - 2t

Add \( 2t \) to both sides to isolate the terms involving \( s \) on one side:
\[

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form is given by:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expanded form is equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\)
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation \(-2a = 6\), we solve for \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{6}{-2} = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t^3\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[
3b = 6
\]

Divide by 3:

\[
b = 2

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the volume of water in the reservoir is increasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the level of water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The rate of change of the volume with respect to time can also be expressed in terms of the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) and the area of the base of the cylinder. Since the area of the base is \( \pi r^2 \), we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know that \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x < a\). This ensures that there is no gap between the two pieces of the function.

Therefore, we need:
\[a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.\]

To solve this inequality, we rearrange it:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.\]
We factor out \(a\):
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.\]
We factor the quadratic expression:
\[a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.\]

We now determine the intervals where this inequality holds by finding the roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\), which are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8\), which is negative.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625\), which is positive.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2\), which is negative.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12\), which is positive.

The inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds in the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\), \([0, 2]\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of length 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

Since we are looking for \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), we discard \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if it is in the interval \([0,1]\)). We need to solve the equation:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Let's substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation to check if it is a solution:
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = (\lambda - 1)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
This means that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, so it does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

By analyzing the quadratic and cubic terms, we find that the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\) has a solution for \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.
\]
Then,
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 4x^4) = 2(2x - 6x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^4) = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4.
\]
We need to solve:
\[
4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4 = x \implies -8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or the roots of the cubic equation \(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots and find that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root. Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), but \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \neq \frac{1}{2}\) is not true. However, we need to check other values of \(\lambda\) to find the correct range.

By further analysis, we find that the correct range is \(\lambda = 2\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the original expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this, we use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this further. Notice that:

\[
\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

Thus, we can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this further. Notice that:

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since all higher powers of 5 will result in a quotient of 0, we stop here. Adding these values together gives us the total number of factors of 5 in \(42!\):
\[
8 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can focus on the region where \( x \le y \) without loss of generality.

Next, we consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \]
\[ f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \) or \( x = 0 \), respectively. Thus, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

Now, we consider the interior of the region where \( -1 < x < 1 \) and \( -1 < y < 1 \). To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \]
From \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \]
Multiplying both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \), we get:
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]
This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) as \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta \le 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \]
Thus, on the boundary of the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), the function \( f(x, y) \) is always equal to 1.

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line passing through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), it intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). By the properties of similar triangles, \(\triangle AMN\) is similar to \(\triangle ABC\) and the ratio of the corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the distances from the vertices to the centroid \(G\). Specifically, since \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of \(\triangle AMN\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of \(\triangle AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144, the area of \(\triangle AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ENG\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides the median \(BE\) into a ratio of 2:1, with \(BG:GE = 2:1\). This means that \(G\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the way from \(B\) to \(E\). The line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and intersects \(BE\) at \(G\), so \(G\) is also the centroid of \(\triangle AMN\). Therefore, \(G\) divides \(BE\) into a ratio of 2:1 within \(\triangle AMN\) as well.

The area of \(\triangle ENG\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of \(\triangle AMN\) because \(G\) divides \(\triangle AMN\) into three triangles of equal area. Thus, the area of \(\triangle ENG\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \frac{1}{3} \times 64 = \frac{64}{3}.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the six prime numbers, only one is even (2), and the rest are odd (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the probability of each event separately:
1. The probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. The probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

**Step 1: Probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.**

There is only one even number (2) out of six prime numbers. Therefore, the probability that Paul chooses an even number is:

**Step 2: Probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.**

There are five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) out of six prime numbers. Therefore, the probability that Paul chooses an odd number is:
\[
\frac{5}{6}

Similarly, the probability that Jesse chooses an odd number is:

"To determine the total surface area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the two triangles formed by the diagonals in the rectangle. The rectangle is composed of 12 squares, each with a side length of 1 unit. Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 3 units by 4 units.

The two triangles formed are:
1. Triangle A with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. Triangle B with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

First, let's calculate the area of Triangle A. The base of Triangle A is 2 units (from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\)) and the height is 4 units (from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\)). The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values for Triangle A:
\[
\text{Area of Triangle A} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of Triangle B. The base of Triangle B is 3 units (from \((3, 0)\) to \((3, 0)\)) and the height is 4 units (from \((0, 4)\) to \((3, 4)\)). Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area of Triangle B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units}
\]

The total surface area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of Triangle A and Triangle B:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ square units}

Thus, the total surface area of the regionombrée is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",10,"[10, '10']",True
"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5 in its prime factorization. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must have at least two trailing zeros.

Next, we need to ensure that the remaining part of the number (after the trailing zeros) is a multiple of 2 and \(3^2 = 9\). A number is a multiple of 2 if its last digit is even, and since the digits are only 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0. However, we already have two trailing zeros, so we only need to ensure that the remaining part is a multiple of 9. A number is a multiple of 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.

The smallest number that meets these criteria is 11100. Let's check:
- It ends in 00, so it is a multiple of \(5^2 = 25\).
- The sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is not a multiple of 9. Therefore, 11100 is not a multiple of 450.

We need to find a larger number. The next smallest number is 11111100. Let's check:
- It ends in 00, so it is a multiple of \(5^2 = 25\).
- The sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6\), which is not a multiple of 9. Therefore, 11111100 is not a multiple of 450.

We need to find a larger number. The next smallest number is 11111111100. Let's check:
- It ends in 00, so it is a multiple of \(5^2 = 25\).
- The sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 9\), which is a multiple of 9. Therefore, 11111111100 is a multiple of 9.

Since 11111111100 is a multiple of both 2 and 9, it is a multiple of \(2 \times 9 = 18\). It is also a multiple of \(5^2 = 25\), so it is a multiple of \(18 \times 25 = 450\).

Thus, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones is:

"To determine the probability that the pion is placed on a gray square of the chessboard, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of the two numbers drawn from the Roue.

First, let's identify the possible remainders when the numbers on the Roue are divided by 4 and 5:
- The numbers on the Roue are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9.
- When these numbers are divided by 4, the remainders are:
  - \(1 \div 4 = 0\) remainder \(1\)
  - \(2 \div 4 = 0\) remainder \(2\)
  - \(3 \div 4 = 0\) remainder \(3\)
  - \(6 \div 4 = 1\) remainder \(2\)
  - \(7 \div 4 = 1\) remainder \(3\)
  - \(9 \div 4 = 2\) remainder \(1\)
  So, the possible remainders are 1, 2, and 3.

- When these numbers are divided by 5, the remainders are:
  - \(1 \div 5 = 0\) remainder \(1\)
  - \(2 \div 5 = 0\) remainder \(2\)
  - \(3 \div 5 = 0\) remainder \(3\)
  - \(6 \div 5 = 1\) remainder \(1\)
  - \(7 \div 5 = 1\) remainder \(2\)
  - \(9 \div 5 = 1\) remainder \(4\)
  So, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Next, we need to determine the probability that the pion lands on a gray square. The gray squares are in the first and third columns and the first and third rows. Therefore, the pion will land on a gray square if the remainder when the first number is divided by 4 is 1 or 3, and the remainder when the second number is divided by 5 is 1 or 3.

The probability that the first number leaves a remainder of 1 or 3 when divided by 4 is:
\[
\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
The probability that the second number leaves a remainder of 1 or 3 when divided by 5 is:
\[

\]

Since the two events are independent, the probability that both events occur (i.e., the pion lands on a gray square) is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the pion is placed on a gray square of the chessboard is:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of specific angles, which gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

In other words, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

For a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by the formula:
\[
-\frac{a_2}{a_3}
\]
In our case, \( a_3 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = -49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Next, we consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). This transformation shifts the roots of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we sum these transformed roots:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5)
\]
This can be simplified as:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15

Since we already know that \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49 \), we substitute this value in:
\[

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan^2 x + \cot^2 x = \tan^2 x + \frac{1}{\tan^2 x} = \frac{\tan^4 x + 1}{\tan^2 x}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{\tan^4 20^\circ + 1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.

Thus, we have:

\[

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum \(S\) of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   Let \(S\) be the sum of all interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the sum of all interior angles \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we substitute \(S\) with \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for the single angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the single angle must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < \text{one angle} < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Set up the inequality for the sum of the remaining angles:**
   Using the inequality for the single angle, we can write:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ + 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ

6. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   Divide all parts of the inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}

"To find the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by expressing the condition mathematically. This means that:

\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Expanding and rearranging the left side, we get:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. This means we need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two potential solutions for \( t \):

\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4
\]
\[
t = -1 - 5 = -6
\]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = -6 \). To express \( -6 \) in the range \( 0 < t < 23 \), we add 23 to \(-6\):

\[
t = -6 + 23 = 17
\]

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

\[
\boxed{17}
\]

To verify, we check that \( t+2 = 19 \) is the inverse of \( t = 17 \) modulo 23. This means we need to check that:

\[
17 \cdot 19 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

Calculating the left side, we get:

\[

Now, we find the remainder when 323 is divided by 23:

\[
323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1

So, \( 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \), confirming that \( t = 17 \) is indeed the solution. Therefore, the answer is:

2. **Calculate the area of one face of the cube:**
   Each face of a cube is a square. The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = s^2

   \[
   A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot}

3. **Determine the total surface area of the cube:**
   A cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total surface area \(S\) is:
   \[
   S = 6 \times A

   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, there are \(12^2 = 144\) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, the total surface area in square inches is:
   \[
   S = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches}

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found by determining the perpendicular distance from a point on one line to the other line. We can use the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and find the perpendicular distance to the second line.

The vector from the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) to a point on the second line is given by
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The distance between the two lines is the length of the projection of this vector onto a vector that is perpendicular to the direction vector of the lines. The direction vector of the lines is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). The cross product of \(\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) gives a vector that is perpendicular to both.

The cross product is calculated as follows:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]
Simplifying each component, we get:
\[
\mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.

The magnitude of this vector is:
\[
\sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

The magnitude of the direction vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) is:
\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

The distance between the two lines is the magnitude of the cross product divided by the magnitude of the direction vector:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangular region with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we have:

\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is the same as the length of \(CD\) since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the height is \(c\). So, we can write:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD \times \sin(\angle ADC)
\]
Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We already know from the equation \((a + b) \times c = 84\) that:
\[
a \times c + b \times c = 84
\]
We need to find \(a \times c\). To do this, we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar in a certain sense, but we can also use the area relationship directly. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height for both \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) when considering \(CD\) as the base, the ratio of their areas is the same as the ratio of their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \times a \times c}{\frac{1}{2} \times b \times c} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
This confirms our earlier ratio. Now, we know that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) plus the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42
\]
Since \(\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{a}{b}\), we can express \([\triangle ABC]\) as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{a} \times [\triangle ACD]
\]
Substituting this into the area equation, we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + \frac{b}{a} \times [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]
Factoring out \([\triangle ACD]\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
Since \(a + b = \frac{84}{c}\), we substitute this in:
\[
[\triangle ACD] \left(\frac{\frac{84}{c}}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] \left(\frac{84}{a \times c}\right) = 42
\]
Solving for \([\triangle ACD]\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = 42 \times \frac{a \times c}{84} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]
We already know from \((a + b) \times c = 84\) that:
\[
a \times c + b \times c = 84
\]
Since \(b \times c = 84 - a \times c\), we substitute this into the area equation:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times (84 - b \times c)
\]
However, we need to find \(a \times c\) directly. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\), and we already know that:
\[
a \times c = \frac{a}{b} \times b \times c = a \times c
\]
Therefore, we need to find the correct ratio. Since the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

3. **Verify the solution** by substituting it back into the original equation.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[

First, square both sides:
\[

Next, cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
\[

This simplifies to:
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

Now, isolate \(x\) by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
-19x = -9
\]

Divide both sides by \(-19\):
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}

Finally, we need to verify that \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) satisfies the original equation. Substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

2. Multiply the result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must alternate.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:

"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the regions involved.

The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

The problem states that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the total area of the shaded region is:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two parts: the region in the smaller circle and the region in the larger circle that are not part of the other circle. Let's denote the central angle \(\angle ADC\) by \(\theta\) in degrees. The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta \pi}{360}
\]

The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} = \frac{\theta \pi}{90}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DC \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]

The area of the region in the smaller circle that is not part of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the region in the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta \pi}{360} - 2 \sin \theta
\]

The area of the region in the larger circle that is not part of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the region in the larger circle} = \frac{\theta \pi}{90} - 2 \sin \theta
\]

The total shaded area is the sum of these two areas:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \left( \frac{\theta \pi}{360} - 2 \sin \theta \right) + \left( \frac{\theta \pi}{90} - 2 \sin \theta \right) = \frac{\theta \pi}{360} + \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} - 4 \sin \theta = \frac{5\theta \pi}{360} - 4 \sin \theta = \frac{\theta \pi}{72} - 4 \sin \theta
\]

We know that the total shaded area is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{72} - 4 \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To eliminate \(\pi\), we divide both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
\frac{\theta}{72} - 4 \sin \theta = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Next, we multiply every term by 72 to clear the fraction:
\[
\theta - 288 \sin \theta = 120
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\theta = 120 + 288 \sin \theta
\]

We need to find a value of \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = 120^\circ\) is a solution:
\[
120 = 120 + 288 \sin 120^\circ

\[
120 = 120 + 288 \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical reservoir and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical reservoir, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical reservoir. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical reservoir by the volume of one cylindrical beaker:
\[
\text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4

Therefore, the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill the spherical reservoir is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are angles in the interval \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\). Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{(0.5 - 0.4) \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{0.1 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}.
\]

Finally, we multiply \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}) \sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2 \sqrt{63} + 21}{500} = \frac{2 \cdot 3 \sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{6 \sqrt{7} + 21}{500}.
\]

We can factor out a 3 from the numerator:
\[
\frac{6 \sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{500} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{4 \cdot 125} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{4 \cdot 5^3} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{4 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{4 \cdot 25 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{100 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{500}.

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine the number of ways to form a sub-committee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the sub-committee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible sub-committees and then subtracting the number of sub-committees that do not meet the condition (i.e., sub-committees that are all Republicans or all Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a sub-committee of 5 members from the 14 members of the committee. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a sub-committee of 5 members that are all Republicans. This is given by \(\binom{8}{5}\):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a sub-committee of 5 members that are all Democrats. This is given by \(\binom{6}{5}\):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

Now, subtract the number of sub-committees that are all Republicans and the number of sub-committees that are all Democrats from the total number of sub-committees to find the number of sub-committees that include at least one member from each party:

\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n

 Selon l'énoncé, le produit des trois entiers divisé par their moyenne est 24. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24

Simplifying the left side, we get:

(n-1)(n+1) = 24

This can be rewritten as:

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root. We do this by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{6\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{10\pi}{15}, \frac{12\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\). However, we only need the product of four specific cosines. To proceed, we use the fact that:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}.

We know from the double-angle identity that \(\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), so the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \cdot 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{-1}{32 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.

However, we need to consider the product of all seven cosines from \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)\) to \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\), which is \(\frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}\).

Using the identity again, we find that the product of these three cosines is \(\frac{1}{8}\). Therefore, the product of the four cosines is:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{DM}{\sin (180^\circ - 3\theta)} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we have:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta}
\]

Next, we use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(BD = \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta}\), we get:
\[
BC = BD \cdot \frac{\sin 3\theta}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta} \cdot \frac{\sin 3\theta}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = 2 \cos \theta
\]

Now, we need to find \(AB\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{2 \cos \theta}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \cos^2 \theta
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \sqrt{121 + \cos^2 \theta}
\]

The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2\sqrt{121 + \cos^2 \theta} + 2 \cos \theta = 2\left(\sqrt{121 + \cos^2 \theta} + \cos \theta\right)
\]

To find \(\cos \theta\), we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). In \(\triangle BDC\), we apply the Law of Cosines:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos \angle BDC
\]
Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(\triangle BDC\) is isosceles with \(BD = CD\)), we have:
\[
(2 \cos \theta)^2 = 2BD^2 (1 - \cos 3\theta)
\]
Substituting \(BD = \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta}\), we get:
\[
4 \cos^2 \theta = 2 \left(\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta}\right)^2 (1 - \cos 3\theta)
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
2 \cos^2 \theta = \left(\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta}\right)^2 (1 - \cos 3\theta)
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta\) and \(\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}\), we get:
\[
2 \cos^2 \theta = \left(\frac{\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}}{3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta}\right)^2 (1 - \cos 3\theta)
\]
Simplifying further, we find that \(\cos \theta = \frac{3}{5}\).

Substituting \(\cos \theta = \frac{3}{5}\) into the expression for the perimeter, we get:
\[
AB = \sqrt{121 + \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \frac{9}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{3025 + 9}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{3034}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{3034}}{5} = \frac{55}{5} = 11

Thus, the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
2AB + BC = 2 \cdot 11 + 2 \cdot \frac{3}{5} = 22 + \frac{6}{5} = \frac{110}{5} + \frac{6}{5} = \frac{116}{5}

\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]

We know that the sum of these integers is \(3^7\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]

Solving for \(a\), we find:

\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]

The 27 consecutive integers are \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number. Since there are 27 integers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence. The 14th number is:

\[
68 + 13 = 81
\]

Therefore, the median is:

\[
\boxed{81}

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which is always greater than \(-4\). This means that the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \sqrt{3}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real numbers \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which is equivalent to:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

"To determine the level where the number of boys taking the bus is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls taking the bus, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of girls taking the bus for each level and then compare it to the number of boys taking the bus for that level.

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of girls taking the bus for each level:

1. **9th level:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 300 \times 0.394 = 1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.03
   \]
   The number of boys taking the bus is \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3\).
   The difference is \(159.03 - 123.3 = 35.73\).

2. **10th level:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 300 \times 0.331 = 1.35 \times 109.3 = 147.045
   \]
   The number of boys taking the bus is \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2\).
   The difference is \(147.045 - 103.2 = 43.845\).

3. **11th level:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 300 \times 0.138 = 1.35 \times 41.4 = 56.07
   \]
   The number of boys taking the bus is \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8\).
   The difference is \(61.8 - 56.07 = 5.73\).

4. **12th level:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 300 \times 0.086 = 1.35 \times 25.8 = 35.37
   \]
   The number of boys taking the bus is \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8\).
   The difference is \(35.37 - 34.8 = 0.57\).

Now, we compare the differences:
- 9th level: \(35.73\)
- 10th level: \(43.845\)
- 11th level: \(5.73\)
- 12th level: \(0.57\)

The smallest difference is \(0.57\), which corresponds to the 12th level.

Therefore, the level where the number of boys taking the bus is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls taking the bus is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is equal to \((x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x-9)(x+9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \((x-9)(x+9)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so \(x(x-36) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).

We need to find the intervals where the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative. We will consider each case for the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 < 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 > 0\), the quotient is positive.

We also need to check the points where the numerator or the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), and the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semi-circles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the length of the rectangle.
- \( W \) as the width of the rectangle.
- The radius of each semi-circle is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semi-circles. The circumference of one semi-circle is \( \pi \times \frac{W}{2} \), so the total circumference of the two semi-circles is:
\[ 2 \times \pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \pi W \]

The total length of the track is then:
\[ L + L + \pi W = 2L + \pi W \]

We know this total length is 400 meters, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

To express \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L = 400 - \pi W \]
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]

Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W \]
\[ 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
\[ \pi W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \times \frac{200}{\pi} \]
\[ L = 200 - 100 \]
\[ L = 100 \]

Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[ A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} \]
\[ A = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}

\[

\[

"To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[

\]

Simplify the square root of the fraction:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0

Factor out the common term \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):

Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]

"Given an octahedron with vertices \(A, B, C, D, E, F\), we know the distances from a point \(P\) to five of these vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's consider the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron can be thought of as two pyramids with a square base joined at their bases. The vertices can be labeled such that \(A, B, C, D\) form a square in the \(xy\)-plane and \(E, F\) are the vertices above and below the center of the square, respectively.

The key observation is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point \(P\) to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. This is a known geometric property of regular polyhedra.

Let the coordinates of the vertices be:
- \(A = (1, 1, 0)\)
- \(B = (-1, 1, 0)\)
- \(C = (-1, -1, 0)\)
- \(D = (1, -1, 0)\)
- \(E = (0, 0, 1)\)
- \(F = (0, 0, -1)\)

Let the coordinates of \(P\) be \((x, y, z)\).

The squared distances from \(P\) to each vertex are:
\[
PA^2 = (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2
\]
\[
PB^2 = (x+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2
\]
\[
PC^2 = (x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2
\]
\[
PD^2 = (x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2
\]
\[
PE^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2
\]
\[
PF^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2
\]

The sum of these squared distances is:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2
\]

Substituting the expressions for the squared distances, we get:
\[
(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 + (x+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 + (x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 + (x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 + x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 + x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2
\]

Simplify each term:
\[
(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]
\[
(y-1)^2 = y^2 - 2y + 1
\]
\[
(y+1)^2 = y^2 + 2y + 1
\]
\[
(z-1)^2 = z^2 - 2z + 1
\]
\[
(z+1)^2 = z^2 + 2z + 1
\]

Combine all the terms:
\[
(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (x^2 + 2x + 1) + (x^2 + 2x + 1) + (x^2 - 2x + 1) + x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 + 2z + 1) + x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 + 2z + 1)
\]

Group like terms:
\[
4x^2 + 4x^2 + 4x^2 + 4x^2 + 4x^2 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^2 + 4z^2 + 4z^2 + 4z^2 + 4z^2 + 6
\]

Simplify:
\[
20x^2 + 10y^2 + 20z^2 + 6
\]

This sum is constant for any point \(P\) on the octahedron. Let \(S\) be this constant sum:
\[
S = 20x^2 + 10y^2 + 20z^2 + 6
\]

We know the distances from \(P\) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let \(d\) be the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex. Then:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d^2 = S
\]

Calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Thus:
\[
324 + d^2 = S
\]

Since \(S = 20x^2 + 10y^2 + 20z^2 + 6\), we have:
\[
324 + d^2 = 20x^2 + 10y^2 + 20z^2 + 6
\]

From the earlier equation \(20x^2 + 10y^2 + 20z^2 + 6 = S\), we know:
\[
20x^2 + 10y^2 + 20z^2 + 6 = 20x^2 + 10y^2 + 20z^2 + 6
\]

Therefore:
\[
d^2 = 324
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
d = \sqrt{324} = 18
\]

Thus, the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to that of Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force \( F \) is equal to the mass \( m \) multiplied by the acceleration \( a \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Since Jen wants to launch her softball with the same force as Jack launches his baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

This means:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls: \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \) g and \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) g. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to that of Jack's baseball is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{3}{4}} \]","[3/4, '\\frac{3}{4}']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine how many identical digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

We compare the digits of \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):
- \(1556_7\) has the digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
- \(1165_8\) has the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. We count the number of times each common digit appears:
- The digit 1 appears 3 times.
- The digit 5 appears 2 times.
- The digit 6 appears 1 time.

Adding these counts together, we get:
\[
3 + 2 + 1 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of identical digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To determine the total number of handshakes that occurred at the cocktail, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 6 sorcières and 10 sorciers, making a total of \(6 + 10 = 16\) people.
2. Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once, except for the sorcières who do not shake hands with each other.

First, we calculate the total number of handshakes if there were no restrictions. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 people out of \( n \) to shake hands. Here, \( n = 16 \):

\[
\binom{16}{2} = \frac{16 \times 15}{2} = 120
\]

Next, we need to subtract the number of handshakes that would have occurred among the 6 sorcières if they had shaken hands with each other. The number of handshakes among 6 people is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15
\]

Therefore, the total number of handshakes that actually occurred is:

\[
120 - 15 = 105
\]

So, the number of handshakes that occurred during the cocktail is \(\boxed{105}\).","[105, '105']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). By subtracting \(2x\) from both sides, we get:

\[
-2x + y + 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = -2\), \(B = 1\), and \(C = 2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we have:

\[
d = \frac{|-2(6) + 1(0) + 2|}{\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|-12 + 0 + 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|-10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"Given the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\), where \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are the roots of the polynomial.

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. Then we have:
\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

Next, we consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_2\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_3\alpha_4\). The sum of the roots of this polynomial is:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
and the product of the roots is:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^3 = 2^3 = 8.
\]

The polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is the quadratic polynomial whose roots are the sums of the roots taken two at a time. The sum of the roots of this polynomial is \(a + b + c = 0\), and the product of the roots is \(ab + bc + ca\). We can find \(ab + bc + ca\) using the identity:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
0^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2 \cdot 0 \cdot (-2),
\]
\[
0 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]
Since \((\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab+bc+ca) = 0 - 2(ab+bc+ca) = -2(ab+bc+ca)\), we have:
\[
-2(ab+bc+ca) = 0,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 4.
\]

Therefore, the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = t^3 + 4t - 4.
\]

To find the roots of this polynomial, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of the polynomial is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. The possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4\). Testing these, we find:
\[
t = 2: \quad 2^3 + 4 \cdot 2 - 4 = 8 + 8 - 4 = 12 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = -2: \quad (-2)^3 + 4 \cdot (-2) - 4 = -8 - 8 - 4 = -20 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = 1: \quad 1^3 + 4 \cdot 1 - 4 = 1 + 4 - 4 = 1 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = -1: \quad (-1)^3 + 4 \cdot (-1) - 4 = -1 - 4 - 4 = -9 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = 4: \quad 4^3 + 4 \cdot 4 - 4 = 64 + 16 - 4 = 76 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = -4: \quad (-4)^3 + 4 \cdot (-4) - 4 = -64 - 16 - 4 = -84 \neq 0.

Since none of these rational roots work, we use numerical methods or factorization techniques to find the roots. However, we can use the fact that the polynomial \(t^3 + 4t - 4\) has three real roots, and by symmetry and properties of complex roots, we can deduce that the roots are \(\sqrt[3]{2}\), \(\omega \sqrt[3]{2}\), and \(\omega^2 \sqrt[3]{2}\), where \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The product of the roots taken two at a time is:
\[
\sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \omega \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{2} + \omega \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{2} = \omega \cdot 2 + \omega^2 \cdot 2 + 2 = 2(\omega + \omega^2 + 1) = 2 \cdot 0 = -2.

"Let's define the cost of one crayon as \( c \) dollars and the cost of one jumbo eraser as \( e \) dollars. We can set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. \( 3c + e = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5c + e = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( e \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:

\[ (5c + e) - (3c + e) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2c = 0.58 \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ c = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29 \]

The cost of one crayon is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.

First, we simplify the fraction by performing the division:

\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

We can convert this fraction into a decimal by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a power of 10 to make the denominator a power of 10. In this case, we multiply both by 2 to make the denominator 1000:

\[
\frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000}
\]

Now, we can write \(\frac{274}{1000}\) as a decimal:

\[
\frac{274}{1000} = 0.274
\]

In the decimal expansion \(0.274\), the digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit in this sequence is 4.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(B\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(C\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(D\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying each inequality:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities describe four regions in the rectangle:
1. \(ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
2. \(ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
3. \(ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
4. \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

The intersection of these regions forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with vertices at:
\[
\left( \pm \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}, \pm \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b} \right)
\]

The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \right) \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} \right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area} = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{2a^2b^2}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}
\]

Given \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \), we have \( \frac{a}{b} = k \). Substituting \( k \) into the expression, we get:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4k^2}
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
This tells us that 54 is exactly 9 times 6. Therefore, we can write:
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + 0\]
In this equation, \(q = 9\) and \(r = 0\). Since \(0 \leq r < 6\), the remainder is 0.

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in centimes, remained after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie converted as many pieces of currency as they could into bills, we need to follow these steps:

   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52

   Let's add them step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70

   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07

"To find the average score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score of all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

- The total score for the students who received 90 is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- The total score for the students who received 100 is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Adding these together gives us the total score for the class:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides of the equation:

\[
1 = n - 6
\]

Then, we add 6 to both sides:

\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the first column is:

\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The sum of the second column is:

\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]

The sum of the third column is:

\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) is:

\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 14 - 9 + 6 = 15

"To determine how many fewer feet Jim Marches than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them covers and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim covers. Jim traverses the field diagonally. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states:
\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]
where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width of the rectangle.

Given:
\[
l = 400 \text{ feet}
\]
\[
w = 300 \text{ feet}
\]

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}
\]

Calculate the squares:
\[
400^2 = 160000
\]
\[
300^2 = 90000
\]

Add the squares:
\[
160000 + 90000 = 250000
\]

Take the square root of the sum:
\[
d = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Jim covers 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha covers. Martha walks the length and the width of the field. Therefore, the total distance she covers is:
\[
\text{Distance} = l + w
\]

Substitute the given values:
\[
\text{Distance} = 400 \text{ feet} + 300 \text{ feet} = 700 \text{ feet}

So, Martha covers 700 feet.

Now, find the difference in the distances covered by Jim and Martha:
\[

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
