"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) clockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( -\frac{\pi}{4} \) (since clockwise is the negative direction):**
   Multiplying by \( e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}} \), which is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \), we get:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right)
   \]
   Expanding the product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}i \right)
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 - i - 3i + 3i^2 = 1 - 4i + 3(-1) = 1 - 4i - 3 = -2 - 4i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = -2 - 4i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) = -2 + 2 - 4i - 3i = -7i

"To simplify the expression \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
So, 242 can be written as \(2 \times 121\).

Next, we factorize 121. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. We check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 (1 + 2 + 1 = 4) is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. We check the next smallest prime number, which is 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We check the next smallest prime number, which is 7. Since 121 divided by 7 is approximately 17.2857, which is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. We check the next smallest prime number, which is 11. Since \(121 \div 11 = 11\), 121 can be written as \(11 \times 11\).

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 \]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, we can rewrite \(\sqrt{242}\) as:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of different ways 8 people can sit around a circular table, given that 3 specific people (Пиер, Роза, and Тomas) must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of 3 people as a single unit**: Since Пиер, Роза, and Тomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 people and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a circular table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the people within the block**: Within the block, Пиер, Роза, and Тomas can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table, with Пиер, Роза, and Тomas sitting together, is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange the people within the block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of different ways 8 people can sit around a circular table, with Пиер, Роза, and Тomas sitting together, is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 (x^3)^2 = 100x^6
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 (x^2)^{-3} = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6}
\]

Combining these, we get:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot x^6 \cdot x^{-6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"已知 \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)，我们需要 find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 8 - 7 = 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, multiply the numbers:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

So,

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees by which a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions in which the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated. The angle of rotation for each symmetry can be calculated by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the order of symmetry.

So, we perform the following calculation:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees by which the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the value of \(x + y\) for the point \((x, y)\) on the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we first need to find the equation of the line. We start by calculating the slope of the line using the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\).

The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\), we get:
\[
m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = \frac{5}{1} = 5
\]

Now that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
Using the point \((5, 3)\) and the slope \(m = 5\), the equation becomes:
\[
y - 3 = 5(x - 5)
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
y - 3 = 5x - 25
\]
Adding 3 to both sides, we obtain the slope-intercept form of the equation:
\[
y = 5x - 22
\]

Since the point \((x, y)\) lies on this line, it must satisfy the equation \(y = 5x - 22\). We are given that \(x > 7\). To find a specific point, we can choose any value of \(x\) greater than 7. However, since the problem does not specify a particular value of \(x\), we can use the fact that the problem asks for the value of \(x + y\). Substituting \(y = 5x - 22\) into \(x + y\), we get:
\[
x + y = x + (5x - 22) = 6x - 22
\]

Since the problem does not specify a particular value of \(x\) but asks for the value of \(x + y\) and we have the equation \(x + y = 6x - 22\), we can use the fact that the problem is designed to have a specific answer.

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator of \( f(x) \) is a linear polynomial (degree 1), and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To compute \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) onum, we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, specifically \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). However, we need to adjust the middle term to match the form. Instead, let's consider the expression in a different way by recognizing a pattern in the coefficients.

Notice that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

This is a known algebraic identity for the sum of a geometric series. The expression \(100^3 - 1\) can be factored as:
\[100^3 - 1 = (100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1).\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{(100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1)}{99}.\]

Since \(100 - 1 = 99\), the \(99\) in the numerator and the denominator cancel each other out:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 100^2 + 100 + 1.\]

Now, we just need to compute \(100^2 + 100 + 1\):

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let's consider a general vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Define the function \( f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \) and the constraint \( g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 \). The gradients are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y) \quad \text{and} \quad \nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\lambda\), we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13 \implies \frac{6y}{x} - \frac{6x}{y} = 9 \implies \frac{6y^2 - 6x^2}{xy} = 9 \implies \frac{6(y^2 - x^2)}{xy} = 9 \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). Solving for \( y \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \), we get

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

So, the solutions are

\[
y = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = -\frac{1}{2}x.
\]

Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we get

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Substituting these values into \( f(x, y) \), we get

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

Substituting \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x \) into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we get

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{2}x \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{1}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies \frac{5}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Substituting these values into \( f(x, y) \), we get

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot \left( -\frac{2}{5} \right) + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 16, and the operator norm of \( A \) is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4.

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10.**

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"Let's define the weight of a three as \( T \), the weight of a four as \( F \), and the weight of a five as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

\[ 10T = 3F + G \]

2. The weight of two three's and one five is equal to the weight of one four:

We need to find the ratio of the weight of three three's to the weight of one four, which is \( \frac{3T}{F} \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = F - 2T \]

Next, substitute \( G = F - 2T \) into the first equation:

\[ 10T = 4F - 2T \]
\[ 12T = 4F \]

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[

\[

\[

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2

\[
a \cdot bt = abt

\[

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:

\[
a = -3

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[

\[
b = 2

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):

The tank is being filled with water at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. The water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The rate at which the volume of water in the tank is increasing is equal to the rate at which the tank is being filled, so we can write:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The volume of water in the tank at any time is \( V = \pi r^2 h \). By differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time \( t \), we get:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
- If \(a > 0\), then \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards. The minimum value of \(ax^2\) occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). As \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(\infty\), \(ax^2\) increases from \(a^3\) to \(\infty\).
- If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x \geq 0\). The function is a horizontal line at \(y = 0\).
- If \(a < 0\), then \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening downwards. As \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(\infty\), \(ax^2\) decreases from \(a^3\) to \(-\infty\).

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
- If \(a > 0\), then \(ax + 2a\) is a line with a positive slope. As \(x\) decreases from \(a\) to \(-\infty\), \(ax + 2a\) decreases from \(a^2 + 2a\) to \(-\infty\).
- If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x < 0\). The function is a horizontal line at \(y = 0\).
- If \(a < 0\), then \(ax + 2a\) is a line with a negative slope. As \(x\) decreases from \(a\) to \(-\infty\), \(ax + 2a\) increases from \(a^2 + 2a\) to \(\infty\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line
For the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must cover all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).
- If \(a = 0\), the function is a horizontal line at \(y = 0\), which does not cover all real numbers.
- If \(a < 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(\infty\). Since \(a^3\) is a negative number, the function covers all real numbers.

Now, we solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\) for \(a > 0\):
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0 \]

The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since we are considering \(a > 0\), we test the intervals \((0, 2)\) and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(0 < a < 2\), choose \(a = 1\): \(1(1-2)(1+1) = 1(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0\), so the inequality holds.
- For \(a > 2\), choose \(a = 3\): \(3(3-2)(3+1) = 3(1)(4) = 12 > 0\), so the inequality does not hold.

Therefore, the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\) holds for \(0 < a \leq 2\). The largest value of \(a\) in this range is \(a = 2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the cubic equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.

\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) \right] + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda^2 - 1 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 \right] = 0.
\]
For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2) - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + 2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2 - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
0 + 0 - 2\lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-2\lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
We need to check if \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\) satisfies the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). For \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\), the function is:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x (1 - x) = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}.
\]
The fixed points are:
\[
f(x) = x \implies \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2} = x \implies -\frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x}{2} = 0 \implies -\frac{x(x + 1)}{2} = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } x = -1.
\]
Since \(x = -1\) is not in the interval \([0,1]\), the only fixed point is \(x = 0\). Now, we check \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f\left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(1 - \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2 - x + x^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} (x - x^2)(2 - x + x^2).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = \frac{1}{4} (2x - x^2 - 2x^2 + x^3 + x^2 - x^4) = \frac{1}{4} (2x - 2x^2 + x^3 - x^4) = \frac{1}{4} x (2 - 2x + x^2 - x^3) = x.
\]
Thus, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), but \(f(x) \neq x\) for \(x \neq 0\). Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is:

\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we can use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(30^\circ - 5^\circ) + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin(30^\circ - 5^\circ) - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the angle subtraction formulas \(\cos(30^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ + \sin 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin(30^\circ - 5^\circ) = \sin 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \cos 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ\), we get:
\[
\frac{\cos 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ + \sin 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \cos 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{1}{2} \sin 5^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{3}{2} \sin 5^\circ}{-\frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{2}}{\frac{-\cos 5^\circ - \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{-\cos 5^\circ - \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ} = -\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 5^\circ + \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ}.
\]
This expression is the negative of the tangent of the angle whose tangent is \(\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 5^\circ + \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ}\). We recognize that:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 5^\circ + \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ} = \tan(60^\circ + 5^\circ) = \tan 65^\circ.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = -\tan 65^\circ = \tan(180^\circ - 65^\circ) = \tan 115^\circ.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x, \]
\[ f(0, y) = 0 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y. \]
The maximum value of \( x \) and \( y \) on the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, 0) \) and \( f(0, y) \) is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). The function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We evaluate \( f(x, x) \) at these critical points:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1. \]
The maximum value of \( f(x, x) \) is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points inside the region \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) that could give a value greater than 1. We use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le (x^2 + y^2)(1 - y^2 + 1 - x^2) = (x^2 + y^2)(2 - x^2 - y^2). \]
Let \( u = x^2 + y^2 \). Then \( 0 \le u \le 2 \), and the inequality becomes:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le u(2 - u) = -u^2 + 2u. \]
The quadratic function \( -u^2 + 2u \) achieves its maximum value at \( u = 1 \), and the maximum value is:
\[ -1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 1. \]
Therefore, \( (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le 1 \), which implies:
\[ x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \le 1. \]

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\|
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{OB}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\).

The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\

Substituting the given vectors \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[

\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\

We expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplify each component:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\|\):

\[
\|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}

\[
\|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{180}

\|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\| = 6\sqrt{5}

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distances from the centroid \(G\) to the sides \(BC\) and from the vertex \(A\) to the side \(BC\). Since \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, the height from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\). Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now that we have \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term (\(a_6\)) using the general formula:

\[a_6 = a_1 + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 375\]
\[a_6 = 350\]

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a decimal, we will follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the denominator:**
   \[
   2^2 = 4
   \]
   \[
   5^7 = 78125
   \]
   Therefore, the denominator is:
   \[
   2^2 \cdot 5^7 = 4 \cdot 78125
   \]

2. **Calculate the product of the denominator:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 78125 = 312500
   \]
   So, the fraction becomes:
   \[
   \frac{21}{312500}

3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**
   To convert \(\frac{21}{312500}\) to a decimal, we perform the division \(21 \div 312500\).

   Let's do the division step-by-step:

   - \(312500\) goes into \(21\) zero times.
   - Add a decimal point and a zero to make it \(210\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(210\) zero times.

   - \(312500\) goes into \(210000\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(2100000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2100000\) six times (since \(312500 \times 6 = 1875000\)).
   - Subtract \(1875000\) from \(2100000\) to get a remainder of \(225000\).
   - Add another zero to make it \(2250000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2250000\) seven times (since \(312500 \times 7 = 2187500\)).
   - Subtract \(2187500\) from \(2250000\) to get a remainder of \(62500\).
   - Add another zero to make it \(625000\).

"To determine how many positive two-digit numbers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers and then identify all two-digit divisors of the GCD.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2

From this list, we select the two-digit numbers:

This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are:

"Let's define the variables for the problem:
- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( p \) be the number of pentimes.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following system of equations:
1. \( d + p = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5p = 75 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2d + p = 15 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( d + p = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + p = 15 \)

Next, we can eliminate \( p \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2d + p) - (d + p) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2d + p - d - p = 4 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( p \):

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Пол and Daniel is even, we first identify the set of the first six prime numbers. These numbers are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In the set of the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and five odd numbers, which are \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Пol and Daniel each choose a number. Since there are 6 choices for each of them, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both numbers chosen are even.
2. Both numbers chosen are odd.

For the first scenario, there is only one even number, so there is only \(1 \times 1 = 1\) way for both numbers to be even.

For the second scenario, there are five odd numbers, so there are \(5 \times 5 = 25\) ways for both numbers to be odd.

Adding these two scenarios together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

The probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Пol and Daniel is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region in the given right-angled rectangle formed by twelve 1 on 1 squares, we need to analyze the shaded triangles formed by the diagonals.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the rectangle. The rectangle is formed by three columns and four rows of squares, so its dimensions are 3 units by 4 units.

Next, we consider the two diagonals drawn in the rectangle:
1. The diagonal from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
2. The diagonal from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner.

These diagonals intersect at the top-left corner of the rectangle and divide it into four triangular regions. We need to find the area of the two shaded triangles.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle
The area of the rectangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square units}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the area of each triangle
Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, each triangle formed by the diagonals has an equal area. Therefore, the area of each triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of each triangle} = \frac{\text{Area of the rectangle}}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ square units}
\]

### Step 3: Identify the shaded triangles
The shaded region consists of two of these triangles:
1. The triangle with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The triangle with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 4: Calculate the total area of the shaded region
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two shaded triangles:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ square units}

"To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 450 and consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5 in its prime factorization. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must end in ""00"".

Next, we need to ensure that the number has at least one factor of 2. Since the number ends in ""00"", it already has a factor of 2 (and actually a factor of 100, which includes two factors of 2).

Now, we need to ensure that the number has at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits will be the number of 1's in the number. Therefore, we need at least two 1's in the number.

The smallest number that meets all these criteria is 1100. Let's check:
- It ends in ""00"", so it has a factor of \(5^2\).
- It has two 1's, so the sum of its digits is 2, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 1100 is not a valid number.

We need to find a larger number. The next smallest number we can try is 11100. Let's check:
- It ends in ""00"", so it has a factor of \(5^2\).
- It has three 1's, so the sum of its digits is 3, which is divisible by 3.
- It has one 1 in the hundreds place, which means it has a factor of 2.

Therefore, 11100 is a valid number. It is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 450 and consists only of the digits 0 and 1.

"To determine the probability that the ball will be placed on a shaded square on the chessboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the possible remainders when the first number is divided by 4.
2. Identify the possible remainders when the second number is divided by 5.
3. Determine the total number of possible outcomes.
4. Determine the number of favorable outcomes (i.e., the number of shaded squares).
5. Calculate the probability.

**Step 1: Identify the possible remainders when the first number is divided by 4.**

The first number can be any of the numbers on the wheel, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. When these numbers are divided by 4, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 0. However, since the wheel is divided into four equal parts, each remainder (1, 2, 3) will appear 4 times, and the remainder 0 will appear 4 times as well. But since we are only interested in the remainders 1, 2, and 3, we can consider each of these remainders as equally likely.

**Step 2: Identify the possible remainders when the second number is divided by 5.**

The second number can be any of the numbers on the wheel, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. When these numbers are divided by 5, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 0. However, since the wheel is divided into five equal parts, each remainder (1, 2, 3, 4) will appear 3 times, and the remainder 0 will appear 1 time. But since we are only interested in the remainders 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can consider each of these remainders as equally likely.

**Step 3: Determine the total number of possible outcomes.**

Since there are 4 possible remainders for the first number and 5 possible remainders for the second number, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of favorable outcomes.**

The favorable outcomes are the outcomes where the ball lands on a shaded square. From the diagram, we can see that there are 4 shaded squares on the chessboard. Therefore, there are 4 favorable outcomes.

**Step 5: Calculate the probability.**

The probability that the ball will be placed on a shaded square is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

Thus, the probability that the ball will be placed on a shaded square on the chessboard is:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

\[

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Using the triple angle formula for tangent, \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\), we substitute \(\theta = 40^\circ\) and \(\tan 3\theta = -\sqrt{3}\):

\[
-\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 40^\circ - \tan^3 40^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
-\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 40^\circ) = 3\tan 40^\circ - \tan^3 40^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 40^\circ = 3\tan 40^\circ - \tan^3 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 40^\circ + 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 40^\circ - 3\tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

The roots of this polynomial are \(\tan 40^\circ\), \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the squares of the roots of the polynomial \(x^3 + 3\sqrt{3}x^2 - 3x - \sqrt{3} = 0\) can be found using the identity:

\[
\tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 60^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ = (\tan 40^\circ + \tan 60^\circ + \tan 80^\circ)^2 - 2(\tan 40^\circ \tan 60^\circ + \tan 60^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ).
\]

We know that \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\tan 40^\circ + \tan 60^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = \tan 40^\circ + \sqrt{3} + \tan 80^\circ.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula for three angles, \(\tan 40^\circ + \tan 60^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ + \sqrt{3} = \tan 180^\circ - \tan 60^\circ = -\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} = 0\). Therefore:

\[
\tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 60^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ = 0^2 - 2(\tan 40^\circ \tan 60^\circ + \tan 60^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ) = -2(\tan 40^\circ \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ).
\]

We also know that \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\tan 40^\circ \tan 60^\circ + \tan 60^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \sqrt{3}(\tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ) + \tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \sqrt{3}(-\sqrt{3}) + \tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -3 + \tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\tan 80^\circ = \cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\), we get:

\[
\tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ}.
\]

From the polynomial \(\tan^3 40^\circ + 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 40^\circ - 3\tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3} = 0\), we can factor out \(\tan 40^\circ\):

\[
\tan 40^\circ (\tan^2 40^\circ + 3\sqrt{3}\tan 40^\circ - 3) = \sqrt{3}.
\]

Since \(\tan^2 40^\circ + 3\sqrt{3}\tan 40^\circ - 3 = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 40^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan 80^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 40^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\circ}{\tan 10^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\tan 10^\circ} \cdot \frac{\tan 40^\) \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles, excluding one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles, excluding one, is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(A\) be the measure of the excluded angle. Therefore, the total sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + A
   \]

3. **Substitute the formula for \(S\) into the equation:**
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + A
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for \(A\):**
   Since \(A\) is an interior angle of a polygon, it must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
   \[
   0 < A < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Set up inequalities to find the range for \(n\):**
   Substitute the bounds of \(A\) into the equation:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequalities for \(n\):**
   First, divide all parts of the inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444
   \]

7. **Determine the integer value of \(n\):**
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value for \(n\) is:
   \[
   n = 8

"To find a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \]
so \( x = 5 \) is a solution. Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the expression for \( t \), we get:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4, \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since \( t \) must be a positive integer between 0 and 23, we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). However, we need to check if \( t = 4 \) is odd. Since 4 is even, we need to check if there are any other solutions. Since we have already found all solutions to the quadratic equation, and the only other solution is \( t = -6 \), which is not in the range \( 0 < t < 23 \), we need to recheck our conditions. we need

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

First, let's find the side length of the cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one face of the cube. The area \( A \) of a square (which is what each face of the cube is) is given by:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

Since a cube has 6 faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Finally, we need to convert the surface area from square feet to square inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 1 square foot is equal to:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \text{ square inches} \]
Therefore, the total surface area in square inches is:
\[ S = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its negative radical conjugate, we first need to determine what the negative radical conjugate is. The negative radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\) and the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\):

\[
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Then, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle.

The rectangle spans from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). However, points on the boundary of the rectangle are not included in the interior. Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. The number of integer values in this range is:
\[
4 - (-4) + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9
\]

Similarly, the \(y\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-4 < y < 4

This means \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\), inclusive. The number of integer values in this range is:
\[

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible \(x\)-coordinates by the number of possible \(y\)-coordinates:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

Next, we apply the distributive property again to each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a},
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}).
\]

We can factor out the scalar multiples of the cross products:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these vectors into the expression, we have:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{AD}{DC} \implies \frac{AB}{b} = \frac{a}{c}
\]
This implies:
\[
AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(BC\) to \(AD\), which is the same as the length of \(CD\) since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the height is \(c\). So, we have:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c \implies 84 = (a + b) \times c
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD \times \sin(\angle ADC)
\]
Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) simplifies to:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We already know from the equation \(84 = (a + b) \times c\) that:
\[
a \times c = 84 - b \times c
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = [ABCD] - [\triangle ABC] = 42 - \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

From the equation \(84 = (a + b) \times c\), we can express \(b \times c\) as:
\[
b \times c = 84 - a \times c
\]

Substituting \(b \times c = 84 - a \times c\) into the expression for the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = 42 - \frac{1}{2} \times (84 - a \times c) = 42 - 42 + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

Since we already know that \(\frac{1}{2} \times a \times c\) is the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{84}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

   Simplify the expression inside the square roots:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{19} \cdot \frac{19}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

1. **Understand the problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (the number of ways to rotate the circle) to account for the rotational symmetry.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two parts: a segment of the larger circle and a segment of the smaller circle. Let's denote the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) by \(\theta\) (in radians).

The area of the segment of the larger circle is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2 \sin \theta
\]

The area of the segment of the smaller circle is the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2} \theta
\]
The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is the same as before, which is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle } ADC = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \theta - 2 \sin \theta
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = (2\theta - 2 \sin \theta) + \left(\frac{1}{2} \theta - 2 \sin \theta\right) = 2\theta + \frac{1}{2} \theta - 2 \sin \theta - 2 \sin \theta = \frac{5}{2} \theta - 4 \sin \theta
\]

We know that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{5}{2} \theta - 4 \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve this equation, we can use numerical methods or recognize that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution. Let's verify:
\[
\frac{5}{2} \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) - 4 \sin \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{5 \cdot 2\pi}{2 \cdot 3} - 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} - 2\sqrt{3}
\]
Since \(\sin \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
\frac{5\pi}{3} - 2\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{3} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
This confirms that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is indeed a solution. Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical mug, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:

(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100:
\[
\frac{3}{25} = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{25 \cdot 4} = \frac{12}{100}

\[
\frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a commission consisting of 8 republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the subcommittee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of republicans or only of Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 commission members. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of republicans. There are 8 republicans, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of Democrats. There are 6 Democrats, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

Now, subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of Democrats from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:

\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[

"Let the three consecutive integer numbers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). The product of these three numbers is given by:

\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]

We are also given that this product, when divided by the arithmetic mean of the three numbers, equals 24. The arithmetic mean of the three numbers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

So, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

\[

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

If \( n = 5 \), the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6. If \( n = -5 \), the three consecutive integers are -6, -5, and -4. The largest number in the set {4, 5, 6} is 6, and the largest number in the set {-6, -5, -4} is -4. Since we are asked for the largest of the three consecutive integers, the answer is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 4x^3 - 8x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = \cos \theta\) and \(\theta = \frac{2k\pi}{15}\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\).

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDM\):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos \angle BDM
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\) and \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have \(\cos \angle BDM = -\cos 3\theta\). Therefore:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos 3\theta) = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
We also know that \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\), so:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
Since \(BC = 2BM = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2}\), we substitute \(BC\) into the equation. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and the properties of the triangle. By symmetry and trigonometric identities, we find that \(\theta = 30^\circ\). Therefore:
\[
AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \left(\frac{2 \cdot 11 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + 333} = \sqrt{454} = 11\sqrt{3}

The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{3} + 11\sqrt{3} + 2 \cdot 11 \sqrt{3} = 44\sqrt{3}

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factor the quadratic equation:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(y\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \).

- For \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  This interval satisfies the inequality.

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  This interval does not satisfy the inequality.

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:

\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we substitute back:

\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answer

Combining the solutions from both steps, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Therefore, the final answer in interval notation is:

\]
\[

\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of two variables taken one at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,

so
\[
s = 4.

Now substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):

- For the 9th class: \(1.0426\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.0426 = 0.3074\))
- For the 10th class: \(1.0393\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.0393 = 0.3107\))

Next, let's analyze the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor out an \(x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x - 36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals where the denominator is not zero (i.e., \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\)). We will consider the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\).

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\).

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) < 0\) (since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\).

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) < 0\) (since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\).

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are positive).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\).

From the analysis above, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), we exclude these points from the solution set.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote:
- \( l \) as the length of the rectangle,
- \( w \) as the width of the rectangle,
- \( r \) as the radius of the semicircles.

Since the semicircles are attached to the width of the rectangle, the radius \( r \) is half of the width:
\[
r = \frac{w}{2}
\]

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi r = \pi r
\]

Thus, the total circumference of the two semicircles is:
\[
2 \times \pi r = 2\pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = \pi w
\]

The total length of the track is given by:
\[
l + l + \pi w = 2l + \pi w
\]

We know this total length is 400 meters:
\[
2l + \pi w = 400
\]

We need to express \( l \) in terms of \( w \):
\[
2l = 400 - \pi w
\]
\[
l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = l \times w
\]

Substitute \( l \) from the equation above into the area formula:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}\right) w
\]
\[
A = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w
\]
\[
200 - \pi w = 0
\]
\[
\pi w = 200
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Next, we substitute \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( l \):
\[
l = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)
\]
\[
l = 200 - 100
\]
\[
l = 100
\]

Now, we calculate the maximum area \( A \):
\[
A = l \times w
\]
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Thus, the maximum possible area of the rectangular field is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{20000}{\pi}}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides (since side lengths are positive), we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is also defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \(2x\):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us three solutions:

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

Solving \(x^2 = 2\), we get:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \(x = 0\):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \(x = \sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2
\]

Substitute these values back into the function:

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Since \((- \sqrt{2})^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4\) and \((- \sqrt{2})^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\), we get:

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

The distance is expressed as \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

Finally, let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2.

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces. The vertices can be arranged in such a way that they form two pyramids with a square base, and the distance between any two opposite vertices (the vertices of the two pyramids) is the same.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) such that \(A, C, E\) are on one pyramid and \(B, D, F\) are on the other pyramid. The distance between any two opposite vertices is the same, and we can use the given distances from point \(P\) to five of the vertices to find the distance to the sixth vertex.

The key property we will use is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant. This is a known geometric property of regular polyhedra.

Let's denote the distance from point \(P\) to vertex \(F\) as \(x\). According to the property, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[
3^2 = 9
\]
\[
7^2 = 49
\]
\[
8^2 = 64
\]
\[
9^2 = 81
\]
\[
11^2 = 121
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant, we need to find the value of this constant. However, we can use the symmetry and properties of the octahedron to simplify our problem.

Given that the distances from \(P\) to five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, and knowing that the sum of the squares of these distances plus \(x^2\) must equal the constant, we can use the fact that the distances to opposite vertices are equal. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices of one pyramid must equal the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices of the other pyramid.

Since the distances to the vertices of one pyramid are 3, 7, 8, and 9, and the distances to the vertices of the other pyramid are 11 and \(x\), we can set up the equation:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 = 11^2 + x^2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 = 121 + x^2
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
203 = 121 + x^2
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):
\[
x^2 = 203 - 121
\]
\[
x^2 = 82
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{82}
\]

Thus, the distance from point \(P\) to the sixth vertex is:
\[

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the baseball to the acceleration of the softball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force \( F \) applied to an object is equal to the mass \( m \) of the object multiplied by its acceleration \( a \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Given that the force applied to both the baseball and the softball is the same, we can set up the following equations for the two objects:

For the baseball:
\[ F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

For the softball:
\[ F = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \]

Since the force \( F \) is the same in both equations, we can set the right-hand sides of the equations equal to each other:

\[ m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \]

Next, we solve for the ratio of the acceleration of the baseball to the acceleration of the softball by isolating \( a_{\text{baseball}} \) and \( a_{\text{softball}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{baseball}}}{a_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{m_{\text{softball}}}{m_{\text{baseball}}} \]

We are given the masses of the baseball and the softball:
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ g} \]

Substituting these values into the ratio, we get:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{baseball}}}{a_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{150 \text{ g}} \]

Simplifying the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50, we obtain:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{baseball}}}{a_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{200 \div 50}{150 \div 50} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the baseball to the acceleration of the softball is:

"To determine how many common digits are present in the representations of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:

First, let's calculate the number of handshakes between the people. There are 6 people ( вещиците) and 10 people ( мagьosници), so the total number of handshakes between them is given by the product of the number of people:

\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of handshakes between the objects. There are 6 objects, and each object shakes hands with every other object exactly once. The number of ways to choose 2 objects out of 6 to shake hands is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the total number of objects:

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]

Now, we add the number of handshakes between the people and the number of handshakes between the objects to get the total number of handshakes:

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Now, substitute \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(x_1\), and \(y_1\) into the distance formula:

\[

Simplify the numerator:

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\).

From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

Now, we need to find the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\).

2. Five monolas and one gola cost \$1.82:

To find the cost of one monola, we can eliminate \( g \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

\[ 5m + g - 3m - g = 0.58 \]

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The distance from a point \((x,y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x,y)\) to a vertex, say \(A(-a/2, b/2)\), is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < ax + \frac{a^2}{4} - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Factoring out \(-\frac{1}{4}\) on the right-hand side:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{1}{4}(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Multiplying through by \(-4\) (and reversing the inequality):
\[
-4ax + 4by > a^2 + b^2
\]

Dividing through by \(a^2 + b^2\):
\[
\frac{-4ax}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} > 1

This inequality represents a line in the coordinate plane. Similarly, we can derive inequalities for the other three vertices \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by these inequalities. This intersection forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with sides parallel to \(AB\) and \(AD\).

To find the side lengths of this smaller rectangle, we need to determine the points where the lines intersect the sides of the original rectangle. For example, consider the line:
\[
\frac{-4ax}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} = 1
\]

Setting \(x = \pm a/2\):
\[
\frac{-4a(\pm a/2)}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} = 1
\]
\[
\pm \frac{-2a^2}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} = 1
\]
\[
\pm \frac{-2a^2}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} = 1 \pm \frac{2a^2}{a^2 + b^2}
\]
\[
4by = (a^2 + b^2) \pm 2a^2
\]
\[
4by = a^2 + b^2 + 2a^2 \quad \text{or} \quad 4by = a^2 + b^2 - 2a^2
\]
\[
4by = 3a^2 + b^2 \quad \text{or} \quad 4by = b^2 - a^2
\]
\[
y = \frac{3a^2 + b^2}{4b} \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{b^2 - a^2}{4b}
\]

Since \(a = kb\), we substitute \(a\) with \(kb\):
\[
y = \frac{3(kb)^2 + b^2}{4b} = \frac{3k^2b^2 + b^2}{4b} = \frac{b^2(3k^2 + 1)}{4b} = \frac{b(3k^2 + 1)}{4}

\[
y = \frac{b^2 - (kb)^2}{4b} = \frac{b^2 - k^2b^2}{4b} = \frac{b^2(1 - k^2)}{4b} = \frac{b(1 - k^2)}{4}

Thus, the side lengths of the smaller rectangle are:
\[
\text{Length} = \frac{a(3k^2 + 1)}{4} = \frac{kb(3k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]
\[
\text{Width} = \frac{b(1 - k^2)}{4}

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[

The area of the original rectangle is:

"To determine the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:

The number of students who received 80 is 20, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The number of students who received 90 is 8, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The number of students who received 100 is 2, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add these three amounts together to get the total sum of all the scores:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of students to find the average score. There are 30 students in the class, so we divide 2520 by 30:
\[ 2520 \div 30 = 84 \]

Therefore, the average score on the test is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's check the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 14 - 9 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 14 - 9 + 2 = 15
\]
Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct.

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Daniel travels compared to Marta, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Daniel travels. Daniel travels along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The formula for the length of the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

Here, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \text{ feet} \]

So, Daniel travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Marta travels. Marta travels along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is:
\[ \text{Distance} = l + w \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 400 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 700 \text{ feet} \]

So, Marta travels 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Marta and Daniel:
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Daniel travels \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Marta.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The roots of the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the relations \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we substitute \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Next, we find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.
\]

We can simplify the denominator \(\omega(1 + \omega)\) using the relation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), which implies \(1 + \omega = -\omega^2\):

\[
\omega(1 + \omega) = \omega(-\omega^2) = -\omega^3.
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we have:

\[
-\omega^3 = -1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{-1}{-\omega^3} = \frac{-1}{-1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
