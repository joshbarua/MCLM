"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) around the origin:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 units (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to seat the 8 people around the table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit. Therefore, the total number of ways is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees that a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to coincide with its original position, we need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles.

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When we rotate the pentagon, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides (which is 5 in this case).

The angle of rotation that brings the pentagon back to its original position is given by:

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices as \(A = (5, 3)\), \(B = (6, 8)\), \(C = (7, 4)\), and \(D = (x, y)\). We can consider two possible pairs of diagonals: \(AC\) and \(BD\), or \(AB\) and \(CD\), or \(AD\) and \(BC\). However, since \(x > 7\), the most likely pair is \(AD\) and \(BC\).

First, we find the midpoint of \(BC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BC = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of \(AD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AD = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints are equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 13 - 5 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 12 - 3 \implies y = 9
\]

Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((8, 9)\). The value of \(x + y\) is:

"In the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we are given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). We need to find \(\tan A\).

Recall the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine:

\]

Given the equation \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:
\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is defined for all angles except where \(\cos A = 0\), which is not the case here), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) a mente, we can use the fact that \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that makes it easier to compute. Notice that:

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = (100-1)^2 + (100-1) + 1\]

\[(100-1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801\]

"To find the smallest real positive number \( C \) such that

\[

\]

for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Multiplying through by \( xy \) to clear the denominators, we obtain

\[
4xy + 6y^2 = 6x^2 + 13xy \implies 6y^2 - 6x^2 = 9xy \implies 2y^2 - 2x^2 = 3xy \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{(-3x)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2x^2)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{25x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{8x}{4} = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-2x}{4} = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

We substitute these solutions back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. If \( y = 2x \), then

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. If \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \), then

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{4x^2 + x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The base \(9\) number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Add these values together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The base \(9\) number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Add these values together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base \(9\), we repeatedly divide by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0
\]

Since the quotient is \(4\) and the remainder is \(0\), we write \(4\) in the most significant place and \(0\) in the least significant place.

Thus, \(36_{10}\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Finally, we recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}

\[ 10T = 2S + G \]

2. due treeks e un goolee areugali in peso a un squig:

We need to find out how many treeksequivale in weight a squig. To do this, we will solve the system of equations for \( T \) in terms of \( S \).

First, let's isolate \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ G = S - 2T \]

Next, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:

\[ T = \frac{3S}{12} \]
\[ T = \frac{S}{4} \]

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4

\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3

\[

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):

Next, we combine like terms:

\]

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):

Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[

\[

\[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical serbatoio, we start by analyzing the given information. The volume of water being added to the serbatoio is \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises by 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius \(r\) of the base of the cylinder.

First, recall the formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius of the base and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

Since the volume of water being added per hour is \(20\pi\) cubic meters, we can express this as:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi
\]

We are also given that the water level rises by 4 meters per hour, which can be written as:
\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4
\]

Using the chain rule, we relate the rate of change of volume to the rate of change of height:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]

Substitute the given values into the equation:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
20 = 4r^2
\]

Next, solve for \(r^2\) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[
r^2 = 5
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(r\):
\[
r = \sqrt{5}

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both regions defined by the piecewise function.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this region occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
If \(a > 0\), the function \(ax^2\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function \(ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases.

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the function increases as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function decreases as \(x\) increases. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line
For the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must include all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the region \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the region \(x < a\).

From the analysis above, we have:
- The minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\).
- The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\).

Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]

### Step 4: Solve the inequality
Rearrange the inequality to form a polynomial:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factor out \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the polynomial are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the polynomial is less than or equal to zero. We test the sign of the polynomial in the intervals determined by the roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8\), which is less than 0.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625\), which is greater than 0.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2\), which is less than 0.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12\), which is greater than 0.

The polynomial \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) is satisfied in the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \([0, 2]\). Since we are looking for the maximum value of \(a\), we take the maximum value in the interval \([0, 2]\), which is \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
" per determinare il value di \( c \) per the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) to have a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \)-terms and the \( y \)-terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of length 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then the equation is satisfied. If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must not be a solution to the cubic equation when \(f(f(x)) = x\) is satisfied.

To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is not a solution to the cubic equation, we substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the cubic equation and check when it does not satisfy the equation. However, a simpler approach is to consider the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its iterates. The function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) is a quadratic function that maps the interval \([0,1]\) into itself. For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), the function must have a periodic point of period 2. This occurs when the quadratic function has a fixed point of period 2, which happens when \(\lambda = 3\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is:

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the original expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

To simplify this, we use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this further. Notice that:

\[
\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \) (for each of the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" and ""P"")

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

\[
\frac{5040}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{5040}{6 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = \frac{5040}{6} = 840

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

\[

\]
Since all higher powers of 5 will result in terms that are 0, we stop here.

Adding these values together gives the total number of factors of 5 in \(42!\):
\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(0, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y \]
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = x \]
The maximum value of \( y \) and \( x \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). The function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \]
\[ 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \]
\[ 4x^2 = 2 \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \]
Since \( x = y \), the corresponding points are \( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \) and \( \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \). Evaluating the function at these points, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1 \]
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1 \]
The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) at these points is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points that could give a value greater than 1. Since the function is symmetric and the maximum value on the boundary and at the critical points within the domain is 1, we conclude that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors originating from the same point. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the baricenter \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distances from the baricenter \(G\) to the sides \(BC\) and from the vertex \(A\) to the side \(BC\). Since \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, the height from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(G\) is the baricenter, it divides the median \(CF\) into a ratio of 2:1, so \(CG:GF = 2:1\). This means that \(G\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the way from \(C\) to \(F\). The line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), so triangle \(   1\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{2}{3}\). The line \(MN\) also cuts the median \(CF\) at \(G\), and since \(G\) is the baricenter, it divides \(CF\) in the ratio 2:1. Therefore, triangle \(  1\) is similar to triangle \(CFN\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area of triangle \(CFN\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\) because \(F\) is the midpoint of \(AB\) and \(N\) is on \(AC\), making \(CFN\) half the area of \(ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle CFN = \frac{1}{2} \times 144 = 72.

Since triangle \(  1\) is similar to triangle \(CFN\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{2}{3}\), the area ratio of triangle \(  1\) to triangle \(CFN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(  1\) is:

We now have a system of linear equations:

2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ 4d = 300 \]

The fraction is \(\frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125}\). To convert this into a decimal, we need to express it with a power of 10 in the denominator. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) to make the denominator \(2^7 \cdot 5^7 = 10^7\).

"To determine the probability that the pedina will be placed on an ombreggata square of the chessboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each number drawn:**
   - The first number drawn can be any of the numbers on the wheel, which we will assume are the numbers 1 through 12 (since the problem does not specify the numbers on the wheel, we will assume a standard 12-number wheel for simplicity).
   - When the first number is divided by 4, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, and 3. However, since the problem states that the remainders are 1, 2, and 3 (which correspond to the columns of the chessboard), we will consider only these remainders.
   - The second number drawn can also be any of the numbers on the wheel.
   - When the second number is divided by 5, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, since the problem states that the remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 4 (which correspond to the rows of the chessboard), we will consider only these remainders.

2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - There are 3 possible outcomes for the column (1, 2, or 3).
   - There are 4 possible outcomes for the row (1, 2, 3, or 4).
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

3. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - The favorable outcomes are the outcomes where the pedina lands on an ombreggata square. From the problem, we know that the ombreggata squares are in the first row and the first column. Therefore, the favorable outcomes are:
     - Column 1 and Row 1 (which corresponds to the top-left square).
   - There is only 1 favorable outcome.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{1}{12}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{12}}\).","[1/12, '\\frac{1}{12}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14
\]

Thus, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

Thus, the value is:

"To determine the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates:
- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis.
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

In other words, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

Therefore, the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{\text{C}}\).","[C, '\\text{C}']",\text{(C)},[],True
"To find the smallest angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians). Since we are asked for the smallest angle, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by recalling the properties of polynomial functions and their roots. Specifically, the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\).

First, we need to determine the polynomial \( g(x) \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):

\[
f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015
\]

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Next, we expand each term in the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot x \cdot 5^2 + 5^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125
\]

\[
49(x + 5)^2 = 49(x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot 5 + 5^2) = 49x^2 + 490x + 1225
\]

\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115
\]

Now, substitute these expanded forms back into the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) - (49x^2 + 490x + 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015
\]

\[
g(x) = x^3 + (15x^2 - 49x^2) + (75x - 490x + 623x) + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015)
\]

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x + 0
\]

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x
\]

The polynomial \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \) is a cubic polynomial with the leading coefficient \( a_3 = 1 \) and the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( a_2 = -34 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is given by:

\[
-\frac{a_2}{a_3} = -\frac{-34}{1} = 34

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\).

\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

This implies that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3.
\]

Therefore, the value of the original expression is:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + 3 = 9.
\]

The final answer is:

\boxed{9}.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of internal angles of a polygon:**
   The sum \(S\) of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   Let \(S\) be the total sum of the internal angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the total sum \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of internal angles, we substitute \(S\) with \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for the missing angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each internal angle must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < \text{one angle} < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Set up the inequality:**
   Using the inequality for the missing angle, we can write:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   First, divide all parts of the inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444
   \]

7. **Determine the integer value of \(n\):**
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value for \(n\) is:
   \[
   n = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by expressing the condition mathematically. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Here, \( x = t+2 \), so we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( y^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( y \) from 1 to 11 (since \( y^2 \equiv (23-y)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \\
4^2 &\equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \\
5^2 &\equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \\
6^2 &\equiv 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}, \\
7^2 &\equiv 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \\
8^2 &\equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \\
9^2 &\equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \\
10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.
\end{aligned}
\]

From the above calculations, we see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = -6 \). To convert \(-6\) to a positive integer modulo 23, we add 23:

\[ -6 + 23 = 17 \]

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True
"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

First, let's find the side length of the cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one face of the cube. The area \( A \) of a square (which is what each face of the cube is) is given by:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

Since a cube has 6 faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Finally, we need to convert the surface area from square feet to square inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 1 square foot is equal to:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \text{ square inches} \]
Therefore, the total surface area in square inches is:
\[ S = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

The total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{864}\) square inches.","[864, '864']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3
\]

Subtracting these values gives:
\[
25 - 3 = 22

Therefore, the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate is \(\boxed{22}\).","[22, '22']",22,"[22, '22']",True
"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, \dots, we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:
\[
a_{2003} = 1 + (2003-1) \cdot 2
\]

First, calculate \(2003 - 1\):
\[
2003 - 1 = 2002
\]

Next, multiply 2002 by 2:
\[
2002 \cdot 2 = 4004
\]

Finally, add 1 to 4004:
\[

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result obtained from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.
\]

Next, we perform step 2. We need to subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):
\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.
\]

Now, we move to step 3. We need to evaluate \( g \) at \( x = 6 \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:
\[

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any \(x \neq 0\),

\[

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.
\]

Using the determinant formula for the cross product, we get:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]

Simplifying each component:

\[
\mathbf{i}((-45) - (-14)) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) = \mathbf{i}(-31),
\]
\[
-\mathbf{j}((10) - (16)) = -\mathbf{j}(10 - 16) = -\mathbf{j}(-6) = \mathbf{j}(6),
\]
\[
\mathbf{k}((14) - (72)) = \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{k}(-58).
\]

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Then, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Therefore, the distance between the two parallel lines is

\[
\boxed{7}.

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly within the rectangle with vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. Therefore, there are \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) possible integer values for \(x\).

The \(y\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-4 < y < 4
\]
This means \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\), inclusive. Therefore, there are \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) possible integer values for \(y\).

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):
\[
9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Thus, the number of points with integer coordinates that are strictly inside the rectangle is \(\boxed{63}\).","[63, '63']",63,"[63, '63']",True
"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine the average price of Juan's francobolli in the 1970s, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s.
2. Calculate the total cost of the stamps from each country in the 1970s.
3. Sum the total costs from all countries.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to find the average price.

Let's start with the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s:

- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

Next, we calculate the total cost of the stamps from each country in the 1970s:

- Brazil: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ centesimi per stamp} = 72 \text{ centesimi}\)
- France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ centesimi per stamp} = 48 \text{ centesimi}\)
- Peru: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ centesimi per stamp} = 24 \text{ centesimi}\)
- Spain: \(13 \text{ stamps} \times 5 \text{ centesimi per stamp} = 65 \text{ centesimi}\)

Now, we sum the total costs from all countries:

\[72 \text{ centesimi} + 48 \text{ centesimi} + 24 \text{ centesimi} + 65 \text{ centesimi} = 209 \text{ centesimi}\]

Next, we find the total number of stamps from all countries in the 1970s:

\[12 \text{ stamps} + 12 \text{ stamps} + 6 \text{ stamps} + 13 \text{ stamps} = 43 \text{ stamps}\]

Finally, we calculate the average price of the stamps in the 1970s by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps:

\[\frac{209 \text{ centesimi}}{43 \text{ stamps}} \approx 4.8372\]

Rounding 4.8372 to the nearest tenth of a centesime, we get:

\[4.8\]

Therefore, the average price of Juan's francobolli in the 1970s is \(\boxed{4.8}\) centesimi.","[4.80000000000000, '4.8']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is equal to \(CD = c\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of the trapezoid can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times (a + b) = 42
\]
We already know that \((a + b) \times c = 84\), so:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

Let \([\triangle ACD] = x\) and \([\triangle ABC] = y\). Then we have:
\[
x + y = 42 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x}{y} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we know:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{\frac{ab}{c}}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

We also know from the area of the trapezoid:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]
Since \(AB = \frac{ab}{c}\), we can substitute \(AB\) in the area formula:
\[
\left(\frac{ab}{c} + b\right) \times c = 84 \implies ab + bc = 84 \implies b(a + c) = 84
\]

Now, we need to find the ratio \(\frac{a}{b}\). From the area ratio:
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{b}{c} \implies x = y \cdot \frac{b}{c}
\]

Substitute \(x\) in the total area equation:
\[
y \cdot \frac{b}{c} + y = 42 \implies y \left(\frac{b}{c} + 1\right) = 42
\]

We know \(b(a + c) = 84\), so:
\[
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{84}{b(a + c)} = \frac{84}{b \cdot b} = \frac{84}{b^2}
\]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b}{c} + 1\right) = y \left(\frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{c}\right) = y \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = 42
\]

Since \(b(a + c) = 84\), we have:
\[
\frac{b + c}{c} = \frac{84}{b(a + c)} = \frac{84}{b \cdot b} = \frac{84}{b^2}
\]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = y \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = 42
\]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\) = y \left(\frac{b + c}{c} = 42 \]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b + c}{c} = y \left(\frac{b + c}{c} = 42 \]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b + c}{c} = y \ \]

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( @ \) to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, we have \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}\). Therefore, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the operation definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \times 21}{30}

We can simplify the fraction by canceling out the common factor of \(10\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle. This means that if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, they must alternate: \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\).

2. **Count the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 to account for the rotational symmetry (i.e., rotating the circle does not create a new arrangement). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 distinct arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting (the two alternating arrangements mentioned above: \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) and \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\)). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct arrangements:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total number of distinct arrangements}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   \[
   \text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **Express the area of the shaded region in terms of the angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. The area of each segment can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circular segment:
   \[
   \text{Area of a segment} = \text{Area of the sector} - \text{Area of the triangle}
   \]

4. **Calculate the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   The area of a sector of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
   \]
   For the larger circle with radius \(2\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
   \]

5. **Calculate the area of the triangle in the larger circle:**
   The triangle formed by the radii and the chord is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length \(2\) and an included angle \(\theta\). The area of this triangle can be found using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin(\theta)
   \]
   For the larger circle with radius \(2\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle in the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)
   \]

6. **Calculate the area of the segment of the larger circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the segment of the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)
   \]

7. **Calculate the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   The area of a sector of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
   \]
   For the smaller circle with radius \(1\):

   The triangle formed by the radii and the chord is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length \(1\) and an included angle \(\theta\). The area of this triangle can be found using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin(\theta)
   \]
   For the smaller circle with radius \(1\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle in the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
   \]

9. **Calculate the area of the segment of the smaller circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the segment of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2}\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
   \]

10. **Set up the equation for the total area of the shaded region:**
    The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the segments of both circles:
    \[
    2\theta - 2\sin(\theta) + \frac{1}{2}\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
    \]
    Combine like terms:
    \[
    \left(2\theta + \frac{1}{2}\theta\right) - \left(2\sin(\theta) + \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)\right) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
    \]
    Simplify:
    \[
    \frac{5}{2}\theta - \frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
    \]
    Factor out \(\frac{5}{2}\):
    \[
    \frac{5}{2}(\theta - \sin(\theta)) = \frac{5\pi}{3}

    Divide both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
    \[
    \theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}

    The equation \(\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a transcendental equation and cannot be solved algebraically. However, we can use numerical methods or known values to find the solution. By inspection or using a calculator, we find that:

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the beaker and the tank and then find the ratio of the volume of the tank to the volume of the beaker.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[

\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:
\[
\text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4

Therefore, the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Repubblicani and 6 Democratici, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the subcommittee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of Repubes or only of Democrats).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members of the committee. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists only of Repubes. There are 8 Repubes, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Then, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists only of Democrats. There are 6 Democrats, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of Repubes or only of Democrats) is the sum of the two values calculated above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:

According to the problem, the product of the three consecutive integers divided by their mean is 24. Therefore, we have:

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

We need to check both cases.

**Case 1: \( n = 5 \)**

The three consecutive integers are \( -6, -5, \) and \( -4 \). Their product is:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3(2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}) - 4(2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2})^3} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 16 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2} \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 16 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Factoring out \(\cos \frac{\theta}{2}\) from the denominator, we get:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}(6 - 16 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}(6 - 4 \sin^2 \theta)}
\]
Since \(BD = \sqrt{AB^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 100}\), we equate the two expressions for \(BD\):
\[
\sqrt{AB^2 - 100} = \frac{1}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}(6 - 4 \sin^2 \theta)}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
AB^2 - 100 = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}(6 - 4 \sin^2 \theta)^2}
\]
Since \(\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}\) and \(\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta\), we substitute these into the equation:
\[
AB^2 - 100 = \frac{1}{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}(6 - 4(1 - \cos^2 \theta))^2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}(6 - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \theta)^2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}(2 + 4 \cos^2 \theta)^2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2} \cdot 4(1 + \cos^2 \theta)^2} = \frac{1}{2(1 + \cos \theta)(1 + \cos^2 \theta)^2}
\]
Since \(AB = AC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude, \(AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2}\). Let \(BC = 2x\), then \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\). Therefore, \(AB^2 = 121 + x^2\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
121 + x^2 - 100 = \frac{1}{2(1 + \cos \theta)(1 + \cos^2 \theta)^2} \implies 21 + x^2 = \frac{1}{2(1 + \cos \theta)(1 + \cos^2 \theta)^2}
\]
Since \(\cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
21 + x^2 = \frac{1}{2\left(1 + \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\right)\left(1 + \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\right)^2\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2\left(\frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} + x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\right)\left(\frac{121 + x^2 + x^2}{121 + x^2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2\left(\frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} + x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\right)\left(\frac{121 + 2x^2}{121 + x^2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2\left(\frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} + x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\right)\frac{(121 + 2x^2)^2}{(121 + x^2)^2}} = \frac{1}{2\left(\frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} + x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\right)\frac{(121 + 2x^2)^2}{(121 + x^2)^2}} = \frac{(121 + x^2)^3}{2(\sqrt{121 + x^2} + x)(121 + 2x^2)^2}
\]
Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
(21 + x^2)2(\sqrt{121 + x^2} + x)(121 + 2x^2)^2 = (121 + x^2)^3
\]
Simplifying, we find that \(x = 11\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 22\) and \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + 11^2} = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}\). The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{2} + 11\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22(\sqrt{2} + 1)

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the 27 integers is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:
\[
68 + 13 = 81

Thus, the median of the 27 integers is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which is always greater than \(-4\). This means that the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \sqrt{3}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real numbers \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), or \(x^2 < 3\). This gives us:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we find that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine which grade has the number of boys who take the bus closest to 135% of the number of girls who take the bus, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls for each grade and compare it to 1.35.

First, let's calculate the number of boys and girls who take the bus for each grade:

1. **9th Grade:**
   - Number of boys who take the bus: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Number of girls who take the bus: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.042\)

2. **10th Grade:**
   - Number of boys who take the bus: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Number of girls who take the bus: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.040\)

3. **11th Grade:**
   - Number of boys who take the bus: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Number of girls who take the bus: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

4. **12th Grade:**
   - Number of boys who take the bus: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Number of girls who take the bus: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.344\)

Now, we compare each ratio to 1.35:
- 9th Grade: \(1.042\)
- 10th Grade: \(1.040\)
- 11th Grade: \(1.5\)
- 12th Grade: \(1.344\)

The ratio closest to 1.35 is \(1.344\), which corresponds to the 12th grade.

Therefore, the grade with the number of boys who take the bus closest to 135% of the number of girls who take the bus is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Combining the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, we get:

The pista is composed of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircular ends. The total length of the pista is given as 400 meters.

The perimeter of the pista can be expressed as:
\[
L + L + \pi W + \pi W = 2L + 2\pi W
\]
We know this equals 400 meters, so we can set up the equation:
\[
2L + 2\pi W = 400
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[
L + \pi W = 200
\]
Solving for \( L \), we have:
\[
L = 200 - \pi W
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the rectangular field. The area \( A \) is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = (200 - \pi W)W
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
A = 200W - \pi W^2
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - 2\pi W
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
200 - 2\pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we find:
\[
2\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{2\pi}

\[
W = \frac{100}{\pi}

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{100}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right)

\[
L = 200 - 100

\[
L = 100

A = 100 \times \frac{100}{\pi}

\[
A = \frac{10000}{\pi}

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[

\[
ST = 2

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):

\[

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = 294 \]
 So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = 294 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

"To solve for the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 equilateral triangular faces. The vertices can be arranged such that they form two pyramids with a square base, and the edges connecting the vertices of the two pyramids are all of equal length.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) such that \( A, B, C, D \) form a square and \( E \) and \( F \) are the vertices above and below the center of the square, respectively. The edges of the octahedron are all of the same length, say \( s \).

Given the distances from point \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex. Let's assume without loss of generality that the distances from \( P \) to \( A, B, C, D, E \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, respectively. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to \( F \).

In a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This is a known geometric property. Therefore, we can write:

\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = k
\]

where \( k \) is a constant. Since the octahedron is regular, the value of \( k \) is the same for any point inside the octahedron. We can use the given distances to find \( k \):

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + PF^2 = k
\]

Calculating the squares, we get:

\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + PF^2 = k
\]

\[
324 + PF^2 = k
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \( k \). To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to six times the square of the circumradius of the octahedron. The circumradius \( R \) of a regular octahedron with edge length \( s \) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

The square of the circumradius is:

\[
R^2 = \left( \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{2s^2}{4} = \frac{s^2}{2}
\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is:

\[
k = 6 \times \frac{s^2}{2} = 3s^2
\]

Since the edge length \( s \) is the same for all edges, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. We already know that:

\[
324 + PF^2 = k
\]

To find \( k \), we need to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to six times the square of the circumradius.

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force \( F \) is equal to the mass \( m \) multiplied by the acceleration \( a \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Since Jen wants to launch her softball with the same force as Jack launches his baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

This means:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls: \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \) g and \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) g. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of handshakes among the streghe:**
   - Each strangide strings her hand with each of the other 4 streghe.
   - Therefore, the total number of handshakes among the streghe is \(5 \times 4 = 20\).

2. **Calculate the number of handshakes among the strangi:**

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:

" per determinare la distanza piu.pi from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Next, we substitute \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(x_1\), and \(y_1\) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10

\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2, t = 1 + i, t = 1 - i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"Let's define the cost of one matite as \( m \) dollars and the cost of one gomma jumbo as \( g \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

1. Tre matite euna gomma jumbo costano \$1.24:
\[ 3m + g = 1.24 \]

2. Cinco matite euna gomma jumbo costano \$1.82:
\[ 5m + g = 1.82 \]

To find the cost of one matita, we can eliminate \( g \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (5m + g) - (3m + g) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 5m + g - 3m - g = 0.58 \]
\[ 2m = 0.58 \]

Next, we solve for \( m \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ m = \frac{0.58}{2} \]
\[ m = 0.29 \]

Since the problem asks for the cost of one matita in centesimi, we convert 0.29 dollars to centesimi by multiplying by 100:
\[ m = 0.29 \times 100 = 29 \]

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\). To do this, we can use long division.

1. **Set up the division:**
   \[
   137 \div 500
   \]

2. **Since 137 is less than 500, we add a decimal point and a zero to make it 1370:**
   \[
   1370 \div 500
   \]

3. **Divide 1370 by 500:**
   \[
   1370 \div 500 = 2.74
   \]

Thus, the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:
\[
0.274
\]

Now, we identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in \(0.274\). The digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit among these is 4.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The distance from a point \((x,y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x,y)\) to a vertex, say \(A(-a/2, b/2)\), is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

For a point \((x,y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < ax + \frac{a^2}{4} - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Factoring out \(-\frac{1}{4}\) on the right-hand side:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{1}{4}(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Since \(a = kb\), substitute \(a\) with \(kb\):
\[
kbx - by < -\frac{1}{4}(k^2b^2 + b^2)
\]

Factor out \(b^2\) on the right-hand side:
\[
kbx - by < -\frac{b^2}{4}(k^2 + 1)
\]

Divide both sides by \(b\) (assuming \(b \neq 0\)):
\[
kx - y < -\frac{b}{4}(k^2 + 1)
\]

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other three vertices:
1. For vertex \(B(a/2, b/2)\):
\[
kx - y < \frac{b}{4}(k^2 + 1)
\]
2. For vertex \(C(a/2, -b/2)\):
\[
kx + y < \frac{b}{4}(k^2 + 1)
\]
3. For vertex \(D(-a/2, -b/2)\):
\[
kx + y < -\frac{b}{4}(k^2 + 1)
\]

These inequalities define four regions within the rectangle. The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of these four regions. This intersection forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a}{k+1}\) and \(\frac{b}{k+1}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \frac{a}{k+1} \times \frac{b}{k+1} = \frac{ab}{(k+1)^2}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = a \times b
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{\frac{ab}{(k+1)^2}}{ab} = \frac{1}{(k+1)^2}
\]

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many soldi, in centesimi, are left after converting as many monete as possible into Banconotes, we need to follow these steps:

   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

2. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**
   - First, add Linda and Sherry's amounts:
     \[
     27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
     \]
   - Next, add June's amount to the result:
     \[
     62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
     \]
   - Finally, add Connie's amount to the result:
     \[
     100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59

   So, the total amount of money collected is \$126.59.

3. **Convert the total amount into Banconotes:**
   - Each Banconote is worth \$1.00.
   - To find out how many whole Banconotes can be made from \$126.59, we take the integer part of the total amount:
     \[

4. **Calculate the remaining amount in centesimi:**
   - Subtract the value of the whole Banconotes from the total amount:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

We see that the sums of the first and third rows are both \( 2n + 1 \). Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first column:

\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the second column:

\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

Then, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the third column:

\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

We see that the sums of the first, second, and third columns are \( 2n + 1 \), \( 3n - 6 \), and \( 2n + 1 \) respectively. Since the sums of the rows and columns must be equal, we set the sum of the second column equal to the sum of the first row (or third row):

\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:

\[
n - 6 = 1
\]

Then, we add 6 to both sides:

\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:

The first row is \( (7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \).
The second row is \( (7+2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \).
The third row is \( 2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \).
The first column is \( (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \).
The second column is \( 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \).
The third column is \( (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \).
The main diagonal is \( (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \).
The other diagonal is \( (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \).

"To determine how many feet less Jim camminates compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim camminates diagonal through the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The formula is:

\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

where \( l \) is the length of the rectangle and \( w \) is the width of the rectangle. For Jim's field, the length \( l \) is 400 feet and the width \( w \) is 300 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \text{ feet} \]

So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha camminates along the length and the width of the field. The total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:

\[ \text{Distance} = l + w \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 400 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 700 \text{ feet} \]

So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many feet less Jim camminates compared to Martha. We do this by subtracting the distance Jim travels from the distance Martha travels:

The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\), which is the real root.

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.

So the expression simplifies to:

3. Route \(D \to B \to A \to C\):
   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]
4. Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
5. Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
   \]
6. Route \(D \to C \to B \to A\):
   \[
   DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \(D\) is 14.

From the calculations above, the shortest distance that can be traveled is 13. Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
