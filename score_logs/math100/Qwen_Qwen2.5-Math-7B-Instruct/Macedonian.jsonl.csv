"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8卢ѓe can sit around a table if 3 specific卢ѓe (Пјer, Роза, and Тomas) must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of 3卢ѓe as a single unit**: Since Пјer, Роза, and Тomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3卢ѓe and the other 5 individual卢ѓe) around a table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the 3卢ѓe within the block**: Within the block, Пјer, Роза, and Тomas can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. Here, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8卢ѓe around the table, with the condition that Пјer, Роза, and Тomas sit together, is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange the 3卢ѓe within the block. Therefore, the total number of ways is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8卢ѓe can sit around a table if 3 од them (Пјer, Роза, and Тomas) must sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term \(T_k\), we get:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot x^{-6}
\]

The \(x^6\) and \(x^{-6}\) terms cancel each other out, leaving:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions where the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated. The angle of rotation for each symmetry position is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full rotation) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate the angle of rotation as follows:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon needs to be rotated to coincide with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Next, we set this equal to the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[

Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). The value of \(x + y\) is:

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in my head, I can use the fact that \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten as \((99 + 1)^2\). Let's see why this is true:

(99 + 1)^2 = 99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 + 1

However, we need \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), which is actually:

\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1 = (99 + 1)^2 - 99

But another way to see it is to use the fact that \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is actually a perfect square:

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we start by letting \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then, the matrix-vector product is

\[

Squaring both sides of the inequality, we get

Rearranging terms, we have

which simplifies to

\[

\]

For this inequality to hold for all \( x \) and \( y \), the quadratic form \((4 - C^2)x^2 + 12xy + (13 - C^2)y^2\) must be negative semi-definite. This means that the discriminant of the quadratic form must be non-positive. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of the quadratic form \(ax^2 + bxy + cy^2\) is given by \(b^2 - 4ac\). Here, \(a = 4 - C^2\), \(b = 12\), and \(c = 13 - C^2\), so the discriminant is

\[
12^2 - 4(4 - C^2)(13 - C^2) = 144 - 4(52 - 17C^2 + C^4) = 144 - 208 + 68C^2 - 4C^4 = -64 + 68C^2 - 4C^4.
\]

Setting the discriminant less than or equal to zero, we get

\[
-4C^4 + 68C^2 - 64 \le 0.
\]

Dividing through by -4 (and reversing the inequality sign), we have

\[
C^4 - 17C^2 + 16 \ge 0.

Let \(u = C^2\). Then the inequality becomes

\[
u^2 - 17u + 16 \ge 0.

We solve the quadratic equation \(u^2 - 17u + 16 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(u = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -17\), and \(c = 16\):

\[
u = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]

This gives us the solutions \(u = 16\) and \(u = 1\). Therefore, the inequality \(u^2 - 17u + 16 \ge 0\) holds for \(u \le 1\) or \(u \ge 16\). Since \(u = C^2\) and \(C\) is a positive real number, we have \(C^2 \ge 16\) or \(C \ge 4\). The smallest possible value for \(C\) is 4.

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Finally, we recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"Let's define the variables for the weights of the objects:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of one triika.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of one skvig.
- Let \( g \) be the weight of one guli.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The weight of ten triika is equal to the weight of three skvigs and one guli. This can be written as:
   \[
   10t = 3s + g
   \]
2. The weight of two triika and one guli is equal to the weight of one skvig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2t + g = s
   \]

We need to find the ratio of the weight of one skvig to the weight of one triika, which is \( \frac{s}{t} \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = s - 2t
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[
10t = 3s + (s - 2t)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
10t = 4s - 2t
\]
Add \( 2t \) to both sides:
\[
12t = 4s
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
3t = s
\]
This tells us that \( s = 3t \), so the ratio \( \frac{s}{t} \) is:
\[
\frac{s}{t} = \frac{3t}{t} = 3

Therefore, the weight of one skvig is three times the weight of one triika. The answer is:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

The product is:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

\[

\[

\]

We know this expanded form must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. For \(t^4\):

This equation is always true and does not provide new information.

2. For \(t^3\):

\[

\[

\[

3. For \(t^2\):
\[

Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[

\]
\[
-6 + 10 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4a = -8 - 4

\[

4. For \(t\):
\[

Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[

\[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we start by analyzing the given information. The reservoir is being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius \(r\) of the reservoir.

First, recall the formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

Since the water is being added at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, we can express this as:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi
\]

We are also given that the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, which can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4
\]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]

Substitute the given values into this equation:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
20 = r^2 \cdot 4
\]

Next, solve for \(r^2\) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[
r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5

\[
r = \sqrt{5}

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{акo } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{акo } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
- If \(a > 0\), then \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards.
- If \(a < 0\), then \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening downwards.
- If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), which is a horizontal line.

For \(x \geq a\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
- If \(a > 0\), then \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a line with a positive slope.
- If \(a < 0\), then \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a line with a negative slope.
- If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), which is a horizontal line.

For \(x < a\), as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\), and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). At \(x = a\), the value of \(f(x)\) is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

### Step 3: Determine the conditions for the function to intersect every horizontal line
For the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must cover all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\), and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, we need:
  \[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
  Factoring out \(a\), we get:
  \[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
  Factoring the quadratic, we get:
  \[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
  The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Testing intervals around these roots, we find that the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 0] \cup [2, \infty)\). Since \(a > 0\), we have \(a \in [2, \infty)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\), and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(-\infty\). Therefore, \(a^3\) must be less than or equal to \(-\infty\), which is always true. However, we need to check if \(a^3\) is greater than or equal to the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\), which is \(a^2 + 2a\). Since \(a^2 + 2a = a(a+2)\) and \(a < 0\), \(a(a+2) > 0\) if \(a < -2\) and \(a(a+2) < 0\) if \(-2 < a < 0\). Therefore, \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\) is always true for \(a < -2\).

- If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), which does not intersect every horizontal line.

From the above analysis, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for solutions where \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find the other roots of the cubic equation.

By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots of the cubic equation are the factors of the constant term \(\lambda^2 - 1\) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient \(-\lambda^4\). The constant term \(\lambda^2 - 1\) can be factored as \((\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), and the leading coefficient is \(-\lambda^4\). The possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{\lambda}, \pm \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}, \pm \frac{\lambda + 1}{\lambda}\).

We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a root, so we need to check the other possible rational roots. Let's check \(x = 1\):
\[
-\lambda^4 (1)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(1)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)(1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + 2\lambda^3 + \lambda^4 - \lambda^2 - \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^3 - 1.
\]
For \(x = 1\) to be a root, we need:
\[
\lambda^3 - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda = 1.
\]
If \(\lambda = 1\), then \(f(x) = x(1 - x)\), and we need to check if there are any other periodic points of period 2. We have:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x + x^2) = x(1 - x + x^2 - x + x^2) = x(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = x(2x^2 - 2x + 1).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
x(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
2x^2 - 2x + 1 = 1 \implies 2x^2 - 2x = 0 \implies 2x(x - 1) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\), but we are looking for \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 1\) does not give us any other periodic points of period 2.

Now, let's check \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\):
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda + \lambda (2\lambda + \lambda^2) - (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda + 2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 1 - \lambda + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^3 + 3\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 2.
\]
For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\) to be a root, we need:
\[
\lambda^3 + 3\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 2 = 0.
\]
By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2\). Let's check \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
2^3 + 3(2^2) - 2(2) - 2 = 8 + 12 - 4 - 2 = 14 \neq 0.
\]
Let's check \(\lambda = -1\):
\[
(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - 2(-1) - 2 = -1 + 3 + 2 - 2 = 2 \neq 0.

Let's check \(\lambda = -2\):

\[
1^3 + 3(1^2) - 2(1) - 2 = 1 + 3 - 2 - 2 = 0.

By numerical methods or further analysis, we find that the only value of \(\lambda\) that gives us periodic points of period 2 is \(\lambda = 2\).

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
To simplify this, we can use the identity \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression can be rewritten using the tangent of a sum or difference of angles. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]
This is not immediately simplifiable, so we use another approach. Instead, we use the tangent addition formula:
\[
\tan(45^\circ + \alpha) = \frac{1 + \tan \alpha}{1 - \tan \alpha}.
\]
By comparing, we see that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \tan 45^\circ = 1.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x, \]
\[ f(0, y) = 0 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y. \]
The maximum value of \( x \) and \( y \) on the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, 0) \) and \( f(0, y) \) is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). The function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We evaluate \( f(x, x) \) at these critical points:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1. \]
The maximum value of \( f(x, x) \) is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points inside the region \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) that could give a value greater than 1. However, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le (x^2 + y^2)(1 - y^2 + 1 - x^2) = (x^2 + y^2)(2 - x^2 - y^2). \]
Let \( u = x^2 + y^2 \). Then \( 0 \le u \le 2 \), and the inequality becomes:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le u(2 - u) = -u^2 + 2u. \]
The maximum value of the quadratic function \( -u^2 + 2u \) occurs at \( u = 1 \), and it is:
\[ -1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 1. \]
Therefore, \( (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le 1 \), which implies \( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \le 1 \).

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\|
\]

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component:

\[
\mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
\]

Calculating the squares:

\[
8^2 = 64, \quad (-10)^2 = 100, \quad 4^2 = 16
\]

Adding these values:

\[
64 + 100 + 16 = 180
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Finally, we find the area of the triangle:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), it creates two similar triangles: \(\triangle AMN\) and \(\triangle ABC\). The similarity ratio of these triangles is the same as the ratio of the distances from the centroid \(G\) to the sides of the triangle to the distances from the vertices to the sides. Because \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of \(\triangle AMN\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of \(\triangle AMN\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\). Since the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144, the area of \(\triangle AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle   1\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides \(\triangle ABC\) into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these smaller triangles is:
\[
\text{Area of each smaller triangle} = \frac{144}{6} = 24.
\]

The triangle \(\triangle 1\) is one of these six smaller triangles. Thus, the area of \(\triangle 1\) is 24.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

"To find the smallest positive product of a 450-digit number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to consider the properties of such a number. The smallest positive product occurs when the number is the smallest possible 450-digit number that is not zero. This number is simply a 1 followed by 449 zeros, which can be written as \(100\ldots0\) (with 449 zeros).

"To determine the probability that a figure will be placed on a shaded square of a chessboard, we need to analyze the conditions given for the two numbers and the structure of the chessboard.

A standard chessboard has 64 squares, with 32 black and 32 white squares. The problem states that the first number is determined by the remainder when it is divided by 4, which can be 1, 2, or 3. The second number is determined by the remainder when it is divided by 5, which can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) possible combinations of remainders.

We need to determine how many of these combinations result in the figure being placed on a shaded square. The shaded squares are the black squares on the chessboard. Let's analyze the pattern of the remainders on the chessboard:

- The first number (remainder when divided by 4) corresponds to the column number modulo 4. The columns are numbered from 1 to 8, so the remainders are:
  - Column 1: remainder 1
  - Column 2: remainder 2
  - Column 3: remainder 3
  - Column 4: remainder 0
  - Column 5: remainder 1
  - Column 6: remainder 2
  - Column 7: remainder 3
  - Column 8: remainder 0

- The second number (remainder when divided by 5) corresponds to the row number modulo 5. The rows are numbered from 1 to 8, so the remainders are:
  - Row 1: remainder 1
  - Row 2: remainder 2
  - Row 3: remainder 3
  - Row 4: remainder 4
  - Row 5: remainder 0
  - Row 6: remainder 1
  - Row 7: remainder 2
  - Row 8: remainder 3

We need to determine which of these combinations result in a black square. On a standard chessboard, the black squares are in the following positions:
- (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7)
- (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8)
- (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 7)
- (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (4, 8)
- (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 7)
- (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6), (6, 8)
- (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 7)
- (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 8)

We can see that the black squares follow a pattern where the row number modulo 2 is different from the column number modulo 2. This means that if the column number is odd, the row number must be even, and vice versa.

Let's count the number of valid combinations:
- If the column number modulo 4 is 1 or 3 (2 choices), the row number modulo 5 must be 2 or 4 (2 choices). This gives \(2 \times 2 = 4\) combinations.
- If the column number modulo 4 is 2 or 0 (2 choices), the row number modulo 5 must be 1 or 3 (2 choices). This gives \(2 \times 2 = 4\) combinations.

So, there are \(4 + 4 = 8\) combinations that result in the figure being placed on a shaded square.

The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
\frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the figure will be placed on a shaded square is \(\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}\).","[2/3, '\\frac{2}{3}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to express the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10. This can be done by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(5\) to make the exponent of \(5\) equal to the exponent of \(2\).

The denominator \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\) can be rewritten as \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0\), \(0\), \(0\), \(2\), \(1\), \(6\), \(0\), and \(5\). Adding these digits together, we get:
\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Thus, the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the double-angle identity that \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\), so \(\sin^2 40^\circ = 4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ\). Using the identity \(\sin^2 40^\circ + \cos^2 40^\circ = 1\), we can express \(\cos^2 40^\circ\) as \(1 - \sin^2 40^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of specific angles, which gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Therefore, the value is:

"To determine the form of the surface described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point in three-dimensional space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis,
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane (measured from the positive \( x \)-axis),
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \) for all points on the surface. This describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

Therefore, the surface described by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Next, we expand each term in the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125
\]
\[
-49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225
\]
\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115
\]

Now, we combine all these expanded terms:

\[
g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) + (-49x^2 - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015
\]

We combine like terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + (15x^2 - 49x^2) + (75x - 490x + 623x) + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015)

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\tan 20^\circ\), \(\tan 40^\circ\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(\tan^3 x - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 x - 3\tan x + \sqrt{3} = 0\) when \(x = 20^\circ, 40^\circ, 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3,

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ = -\sqrt{3}.

Since \(\tan 80^\circ = \cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = -\sqrt{3},

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.

We substitute \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ\) into the identity \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\):

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3\):

\[

\]
\[
\tan 40^\circ + \tan 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ (\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3).

Substituting \(\tan 40^\circ + \tan 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ (\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3)\) into \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}\):

\[

\]
\[
\sqrt{3} \tan^2 10^\circ - 3\tan 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

Multiplying through by \(\tan 10^\circ\):

\[
\sqrt{3} \tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ + 1 = 3\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ,

\[
\sqrt{3} \tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ - 3\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ + 1 = 0.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its exterior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the sum of exterior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \(360^\circ\).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(n\) be the number of sides of the polygon. Since the sum of all exterior angles is \(360^\circ\), and we know the sum of all exterior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   360^\circ - \text{one exterior angle} = 1070^\circ

3. **Solve for the one exterior angle:**
   Rearrange the equation to find the measure of the one exterior angle:
   \[
   \text{one exterior angle} = 360^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \text{one exterior angle} = -710^\circ

4. **Correct the negative angle:**
   Since the exterior angle cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate our approach. The sum of all exterior angles should be \(360^\circ\), but we need to consider the correct approach to find the number of sides.

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test the values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \\
4^2 &\equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \\
5^2 &\equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \\
6^2 &\equiv 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}, \\
7^2 &\equiv 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \\
8^2 &\equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \\
9^2 &\equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \\
10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.
\end{aligned}
\]
We see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have:
\[ t = -6 + 23 = 17. \]
Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:
\[ \boxed{17}. \]","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True
"To find the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area of the cube by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces.

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found, we get:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

**Step 3: Find the total surface area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Since the problem asks for the surface area in square inches, we need to convert square feet to square inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are \( 12^2 = 144 \) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, the total surface area in square inches is:
\[ S = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{864} \]","[864, '864']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3
\]

Subtracting these values gives:
\[
25 - 3 = 22
\]

Therefore, the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate is \(\boxed{22}\).","[22, '22']",22,"[22, '22']",True
"To find the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:
\[
a_{2003} = 1 + (2003-1) \cdot 2
\]

First, calculate \(2003 - 1\):
\[
2003 - 1 = 2002
\]

Next, multiply 2002 by 2:
\[
2002 \cdot 2 = 4004
\]

Finally, add 1 to 4004:
\[
1 + 4004 = 4005

Therefore, the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers is:

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.
\]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.
\]

Now, we need to evaluate \( g \) at 6. The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:
\[
g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

However, we know that \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\). Therefore, the equation \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) is a contradiction. This means there are no real values of \(x\) that satisfy the original equation.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
Simplifying the components, we get:
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product \(\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Then, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly within the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. Therefore, there are \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) possible integer values for \(x\).

The \(y\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-4 < y < 4
\]
This means \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\), inclusive. Therefore, there are \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) possible integer values for \(y\).

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates strictly within the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):
\[
9 \times 7 = 63

Thus, the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly within the rectangle is \(\boxed{63}\).","[63, '63']",63,"[63, '63']",True
"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

Next, we apply the distributive property again to each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a},
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}).
\]

We can use the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, which states that for any scalar \(k\) and vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\),

\[
(k \mathbf{u}) \times \mathbf{v} = k (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}),

Applying this property, we get:

\[

\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

Substituting these into the expression, we have:

\[

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[

\[
2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times c
\]

We need to express \(d\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Let \(AB = x\). Then:
\[
\frac{x}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies x = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

Now, we use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \implies \left(\frac{ab}{c}\right)^2 = d^2 + b^2 \implies \frac{a^2b^2}{c^2} = d^2 + b^2
\]
Solving for \(d^2\):
\[
d^2 = \frac{a^2b^2}{c^2} - b^2 = b^2 \left(\frac{a^2}{c^2} - 1\right) = b^2 \left(\frac{a^2 - c^2}{c^2}\right) = \frac{b^2(a^2 - c^2)}{c^2}
\]
Thus,
\[
d = b \sqrt{\frac{a^2 - c^2}{c^2}} = \frac{b \sqrt{a^2 - c^2}}{c}
\]

Now, substitute \(d\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{b \sqrt{a^2 - c^2}}{c} \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times b \sqrt{a^2 - c^2}
\]

We also know that the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is the same as the height of \(\triangle ACD\). Using the area of \(\triangle ACD\) again:
\[
h = \frac{2 \times [\triangle ACD]}{d} = \frac{2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times b \sqrt{a^2 - c^2}}{\frac{b \sqrt{a^2 - c^2}}{c}} = c
\]

Substitute \(h = c\) into the area formula for the trapezoid:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Since \(h = c\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

From \((a + b) \times c = 84\), we can express \(b \times c\) as:
\[
b \times c = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Given that \(a + b = 14\) (since \(a + b\) must be a factor of 84 that fits the trapezoid configuration), we have:
\[
b \times c = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying. This means we multiply both sides by \(4(3x-1)\):

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

Next, we divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Finally, we need to check that this value of \(x\) satisfies the original equation. We substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) using the given operation \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\), we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the given fractions.
2. Substitute these values into the operation formula.
3. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the given fractions:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\).

Substitute these values into the operation formula:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Next, perform the multiplication:
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]

Now, multiply 70 by \(\frac{21}{30}\):
\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \times \frac{21}{30}
\]

To simplify \(70 \times \frac{21}{30}\), we can cancel out the common factor between 70 and 30. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 70 and 30 is 10.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
70 \div 10 = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad 30 \div 10 = 3
\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30} = 7 \times \frac{21}{3}
\]

Now, multiply 7 by \(\frac{21}{3}\):
\[
7 \times \frac{21}{3} = 7 \times 7 = 49

Therefore, the simplified value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle. This means that if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, they must alternate: \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\).

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the circle is circular, we need to account for the fact that rotating the points does not create a new arrangement. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is \(\frac{4!}{4} = 3! = 6\).

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) and \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\).

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the combined area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

Next, we know that the combined area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the combined area of the shaded regions is:
\[
\text{Combined area of the shaded regions} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded regions consist of two parts: the smaller shaded region and the larger shaded region. The smaller shaded region is a sector of the smaller circle with radius 1, and the larger shaded region is a sector of the larger circle with radius 2.

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the smaller shaded region is the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta \pi}{360}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = \sin \theta
\]

Therefore, the area of the smaller shaded region is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller shaded region} = \frac{\theta \pi}{360} - \sin \theta
\]

The area of the larger shaded region is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} = \frac{\theta \pi}{90}
\]

Therefore, the area of the larger shaded region is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger shaded region} = \frac{\theta \pi}{90} - \sin \theta
\]

The combined area of the shaded regions is the sum of the areas of the smaller shaded region and the larger shaded region:
\[
\text{Combined area of the shaded regions} = \left( \frac{\theta \pi}{360} - \sin \theta \right) + \left( \frac{\theta \pi}{90} - \sin \theta \right) = \frac{\theta \pi}{360} + \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} - 2\sin \theta = \frac{5\theta \pi}{360} - 2\sin \theta = \frac{\theta \pi}{72} - 2\sin \theta
\]

We know that this combined area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{72} - 2\sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we first isolate the term involving \(\theta\):
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{72} = \frac{5\pi}{3} + 2\sin \theta
\]

Next, we divide both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
\frac{\theta}{72} = \frac{5}{3} + 2\sin \theta
\]

Then, we multiply both sides by 72:
\[
\theta = 120 + 144\sin \theta
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\theta - 144\sin \theta = 120

By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = 120^\circ\) satisfies this equation. Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical planters are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we need to calculate the volume of each shape and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical reservoir to the volume of one cylindrical planter.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical planter. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical planter, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical reservoir, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\), we have:
\[
\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84
\]
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Similarly, for \(\beta\):
\[
\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) back into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a commission with 8 republicans and 6 democrats, such that there is at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of republicans or only of democrats).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 commission members. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of republicans. There are 8 republicans, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

Then, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of democrats. There are 6 democrats, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6

The number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of republicans or only of democrats) is the sum of the two cases above:

\[

Finally, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487)
\]

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Now, we multiply these two results together:

\[
(513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000
\]

Therefore, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is:

\[
\boxed{26000}
\]","[26000, '26000']",26000,"[26000, '26000']",True
"Let the three consecutive even integers be \(x-2\), \(x\), and \(x+2\). The product of these integers is given by:

\[
(x-2) \cdot x \cdot (x+2) = 120
\]

This can be simplified using the difference of squares:

\[
x(x^2 - 4) = 120
\]

Rearranging the equation gives us a cubic equation:

\[
x^3 - 4x - 120 = 0
\]

We need to find the roots of this cubic equation. By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-120) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1), which are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 5, \pm 6, \pm 8, \pm 10, \pm 12, \pm 15, \pm 20, \pm 24, \pm 30, \pm 40, \pm 60, \pm 120 \). Testing these possible roots, we start with \(x = 6\):

\[
6^3 - 4 \cdot 6 - 120 = 216 - 24 - 120 = 72 - 120 = -48 \quad \text{(not a root)}
\]

Next, we test \(x = 4\):

\[
4^3 - 4 \cdot 4 - 120 = 64 - 16 - 120 = 48 - 120 = -72 \quad \text{(not a root)}
\]

Next, we test \(x = 6\):

\[
6^3 - 4 \cdot 6 - 120 = 216 - 24 - 120 = 72 - 120 = -48 \quad \text{(not a root)}
\]

Next, we test \(x = 6\):

\[
6^3 - 4 \cdot 6 - 120 = 216 - 24 - 120 = 72 - 120 = -48 \quad \text{(not a root)}
]

Next, we test \(x = 6\):

\]

Next, we test \(x = 6\)

Next, we test \(x = 6]

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root. We do this by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked for the positive value of \(x\), we select \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{66}\).","[66, '66']",66,"[66, '66']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\). This polynomial can be derived from the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

The product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) is given by \(\frac{1}{8}\) (by Vieta's formulas). However, we need to consider the product of the cosines of the angles, which is the absolute value of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\). Since all the cosines are positive in the first quadrant, the product is simply \(\frac{1}{16}\).

Therefore, the value of the expression is:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we are to find the perimeter of the triangle given that there exists a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\).

Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). We need to use the given condition \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

Using the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDC\), we have:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC)
\]
Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(AB = AC\) and \(D\) is on the altitude), let \(BD = CD = x\). Then:
\[
BC^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cos(3\theta) = 2x^2(1 - \cos(3\theta))
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = 2x^2(1 - (4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta))) = 2x^2(4\cos(\theta) - 4\cos^3(\theta)) = 8x^2\cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)) = 8x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)
\]
Next, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ABD\) to find \(x\):
\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AD \cdot \cos(\angle BAD)
\]
Since \(AB = AC\) and \(\angle BAD = \frac{\theta}{2}\), we have:
\[
x^2 = AB^2 + 10^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot 10 \cdot \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
Let \(AB = AC = y\). Then:
\[
x^2 = y^2 + 100 - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
We also know that \(AM\) is the altitude, so in \(\triangle ABM\), by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies y^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \implies y^2 = 121 + BM^2
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\), we have \(BM^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{BC^2}{4}\). Substituting \(BC^2 = 8x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)\) into this equation, we get:
\[
BM^2 = \frac{8x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)}{4} = 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)
\]
Thus:
\[
y^2 = 121 + 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)
\]
Substituting \(y^2 = 121 + 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)\) into the equation \(x^2 = y^2 + 100 - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\), we get:
\[
x^2 = 121 + 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta) + 100 - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \implies x^2 = 221 + 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta) - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x^2 - 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta) = 221 - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \implies x^2(1 - 2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)) = 221 - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)\), we get:
\[
1 - 2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - 2\cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)) = 1 - 2\cos(\theta) + 2\cos^3(\theta) = 2\cos^3(\theta) - 2\cos(\theta) = 2\cos(\theta)(\cos^2(\theta) - 1) = -2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)
\]
Thus:
\[
x^2(-2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)) = 221 - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \implies x^2 = \frac{221 - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{-2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)} = \frac{20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 221}{2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)}
\]
We also know that \(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(\theta)}{2}}\), so:
\[
x^2 = \frac{20y\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(\theta)}{2}} - 221}{2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)}
\]
By trial and error or solving the equations, we find that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}\). Substituting \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}\) into the equation \(y^2 = 121 + 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)\), we get:
\[
y^2 = 121 + 2x^2 \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2\right) = 121 + 2x^2 \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{16}{25} = 121 + 2x^2 \cdot \frac{48}{125} = 121 + \frac{96x^2}{125}
\]
Substituting \(y^2 = 121 + \frac{96x^2}{125}\) into the equation \(x^2 = y^2 + 100 - 20y\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\), we get:
\[
x^2 = 121 + \frac{96x^2}{125} + 100 - 20y\sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{3}{5}}{2}} = 221 + \frac{96x^2}{125} - 20y\sqrt{\frac{8}{10}} = 221 + \frac{96x^2}{125} - 20y \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5}} = 221 + \frac{96x^2}{125} - 8y\sqrt{10}
\]
Solving this equation, we find \(x = 15\). Then:
\[
y^2 = 121 + \frac{96 \cdot 15^2}{125} = 121 + \frac{96 \cdot 225}{125} = 121 + 172.8 = 293.8
\]
Thus:
\[
y = \sqrt{293.8} = 17
\]
The perimeter of the triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = y + y + BC = 2y + BC = 2 \cdot 17 + 2x = 34 + 2 \cdot 15 = 34 + 30 = 64

Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To find the median of the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers is then \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms. In this case, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a + 26\). Therefore, the sum is:
\[
3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a + 26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
Solving for \(a\), we divide both sides by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of an odd number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is the middle term. Since there are 27 terms, the middle term is the 14th term. The 14th term of the sequence is:
\[
a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81

Thus, the median of the sequence is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

This is a quadratic inequality. First, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \]

We can factor this quadratic equation:

\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have:

\[ y < 3 \]

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:

\[ x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Combining the Results

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true. Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is determined by the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), which is:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the final answer in interval notation is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the sum of squares:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, consider the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). This can be rewritten using the identity:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = sp - 12,
\]
or
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has a ratio of the number of girls who took the bus to the number of boys who took the bus closest to \(135\%\), we need to calculate the ratio for each class and compare it to \(135\%\).

First, let's calculate the number of girls and boys who took the bus in each class. Since there are 300 girls and 300 boys in each class, we can use the given percentages to find the number of each.

For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class:
- Number of girls who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.394 = 118.2\)
- Number of boys who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3\)
- Ratio of girls to boys: \(\frac{118.2}{123.3} \approx 0.96\)
- Percentage: \(0.96 \times 100 = 96\%\)

For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class:
- Number of girls who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3\)
- Number of boys who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2\)
- Ratio of girls to boys: \(\frac{99.3}{103.2} \approx 0.96\)
- Percentage: \(0.96 \times 100 = 96\%\)

For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class:
- Number of girls who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4\)
- Number of boys who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8\)
- Ratio of girls to boys: \(\frac{41.4}{61.8} \approx 0.67\)
- Percentage: \(0.67 \times 100 = 67\%\)

For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class:
- Number of girls who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.086 = 25.8\)
- Number of boys who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8\)
- Ratio of girls to boys: \(\frac{25.8}{34.8} \approx 0.74\)
- Percentage: \(0.74 \times 100 = 74\%\)

Now, we compare the percentages to \(135\%\):
- \(96\%\)
- \(96\%\)
- \(67\%\)
- \(74\%\)

The closest percentage to \(135\%\) is \(96\%\), which occurs in both the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class and the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class. Since the problem asks for the class, we can choose either one. For the sake of definitiveness, we can choose the first class listed.

Therefore, the class with the number of girls who took the bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of boys who took the bus is the \(\boxed{9^{\text{th}}}\) class.","[135*(1/100), '9^{']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x - 9)(x + 9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor out an \(x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x - 36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals where the denominator is not zero (i.e., \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\)). We will consider the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\).

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative).

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) < 0\) (since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\).

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   - In this interval, \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36) > 0\) (since both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are positive).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\).

From the analysis above, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), we exclude these points from the solution set.

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircular arcs. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The two semicircular arcs each have a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, which is \( \frac{w}{2} \).

The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{w}{2} \) is given by:
\[
2\pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = \pi w
\]
Since there are two semicircular arcs, the total length of the arcs is:
\[
2 \times \frac{\pi w}{2} = \pi w
\]

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the two semicircular arcs:
\[
2l + \pi w = 400
\]

We need to express the area \( A \) of the rectangle in terms of one variable. The area \( A \) is given by:
\[
A = l \times w
\]

From the equation \( 2l + \pi w = 400 \), we can solve for \( l \):
\[
2l = 400 - \pi w
\]
\[
l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2}
\]

Substitute this expression for \( l \) into the area formula:
\[
A = \left(\frac{400 - \pi w}{2}\right) w
\]
\[
A = \frac{400w - \pi w^2}{2}
\]
\[
A = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w
\]
\[
200 - \pi w = 0
\]
\[
\pi w = 200
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Next, we substitute \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( l \):
\[
l = \frac{400 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2}
\]
\[
l = \frac{400 - 200}{2}
\]
\[

\]
\[

Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( l = 100 \) and \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the rectangular field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[
\frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
\[
ST = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):
\[

\]
\[

\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
\[

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) as a function of \(x\). The distance formula is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(d\), we need to minimize the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \(2x\):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us three solutions:

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

Solving \(x^2 = 2\), we get:

\[
x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \(x = 0\):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \(x = \sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2
\]

Substitute these values back into the function:

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Since \((- \sqrt{2})^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4\) and \((- \sqrt{2})^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\), we get:

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). The sum \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces. The vertices can be arranged such that they form two pyramids with a square base, and the distance between any two adjacent vertices is the same.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) such that \(A, B, C, D\) form a square and \(E\) and \(F\) are the apexes of the two pyramids. The distance between any two adjacent vertices is the same, and we are given the distances from point \(P\) to five of the vertices: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's consider the possible distances between the vertices of the octahedron. The distance between any two adjacent vertices is the same, and the distance between any two vertices that are not adjacent but share a common vertex is the same. Let's denote the distance between any two adjacent vertices as \(a\).

The distance between any two vertices that are not adjacent but share a common vertex is \(a\sqrt{2}\). The distance between any two vertices that are opposite each other (i.e., the distance between \(E\) and \(F\)) is \(a\sqrt{3}\).

Given the distances from \(P\) to five of the vertices, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices is constant. This is because the octahedron is symmetric and the point \(P\) is equidistant from all vertices in a certain sense.

Let's denote the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex as \(x\). Then, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 6a^2 + 6a^2 + 6a^2 + 6a^2 + 6a^2 + 6a^2 = 6a^2 \cdot 6 = 36a^2
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

So, we have:
\[
324 + x^2 = 36a^2
\]

Since \(a\sqrt{3}\) is the distance between any two opposite vertices, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices is constant. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices is equal to \(6a^2 \cdot 6 = 36a^2\).

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices is equal to \(6a^2 \cdot 6 = 36a^2\).

Therefore, we have:
\[
324 + x^2 = 36a^2

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices is equal to \(6a^2 \cdot 6 = 36a^2\).

"To solve the problem, we start by using the formula for force in physics, which states that force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. Let's denote the force by \( F \), the mass by \( m \), and the acceleration by \( a \). The formula can be written as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

According to the problem, Jen exerts the same force on a softball as she does on a baseball. This means that the force on the softball (\( F_{\text{softball}} \)) is equal to the force on the baseball (\( F_{\text{baseball}} \)). Therefore, we can write:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using the formula for force, we can substitute \( F_{\text{softball}} \) with \( m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \) and \( F_{\text{baseball}} \) with \( m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \). This gives us:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the softball and the baseball. The mass of the softball is 200 g and the mass of the baseball is 150 g. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we need to solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \):

\[ \frac{200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}}}{150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}}}{150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}}} \]

The right side of the equation simplifies to 1, and the left side simplifies to \( \frac{200}{150} \cdot \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \). Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{200}{150} \cdot \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = 1 \]

To isolate \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \), we divide both sides by \( \frac{200}{150} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify the fraction \( \frac{150}{200} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- Base 7: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

**Step 4: Count the number of common digits.**

There are 3 common digits: \(1, 5, 6\).

Thus, the number of common digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the total number of rackets laid on the magic box, we need to consider the interactions between the veshers and the wands. Each vesherskainary laid a racket with each wandsicinary, and there are no_interactions between veshers and each other, nor between wandsicaries and each other.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by noting that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Now, substitute \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(x_1\), and \(y_1\) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

\[

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

We also know that:

\]

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 2^2 = 4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t - 4 = t^3 - 4\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = \sqrt[3]{4}\), \(t = \omega \sqrt[3]{4}\), and \(t = \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{4}\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) is a primitive cube root of unity.

"To determine the cost of one monola, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( m \) be the cost of one monola in dollars.
- Let \( g \) be the cost of one holme in dollars.

We are given two equations based on the information provided:
1. Three monoli and one holme cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3m + g = 1.24
   \]
2. Five monoli and one holme cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5m + g = 1.82
   \]

To eliminate \( g \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5m + g) - (3m + g) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[
5m + g - 3m - g = 0.58

\[

Next, we solve for \( m \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[
m = \frac{0.58}{2}

\[
m = 0.29

Thus, the cost of one monola is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

Next, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\). To do this, we can use long division.

1. **Set up the division:**
   \[

2. **Since 137 is less than 500, we add a decimal point and a zero to make it 1370:**
   \[

3. **Divide 1370 by 500:**
   \[

   \[

5. **Divide 3700 by 500:**
   \[
   500 \text{ goes into } 3700 \text{ seven times (since } 500 \times 7 = 3500\text{)}

   Write down 7 and subtract 3500 from 3700:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's denote the side lengths of the rectangle as follows:
- \(AB = a\)
- \(AD = b\)
- Given \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is located at \((0, 0)\).

### Step 1: Equations of the Perpendicular Bisectors
The perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting \(O\) to the vertices will divide the rectangle into regions where each vertex is the closest point. We need to find these bisectors.

1. **Bisector of \(OA\):**
   - Midpoint of \(OA\) is \(\left(-\frac{a}{2}, 0\right)\).
   - Slope of \(OA\) is \(\frac{0 - 0}{-\frac{a}{2} - 0} = 0\).
   - Perpendicular slope is undefined (vertical line).
   - Equation: \(x = -\frac{a}{2}\).

2. **Bisector of \(OB\):**
   - Midpoint of \(OB\) is \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, 0\right)\).
   - Slope of \(OB\) is \(\frac{0 - 0}{\frac{a}{2} - 0} = 0\).
   - Perpendicular slope is undefined (vertical line).
   - Equation: \(x = \frac{a}{2}\).

3. **Bisector of \(OC\):**
   - Midpoint of \(OC\) is \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, 0\right)\).
   - Slope of \(OC\) is \(\frac{0 - b}{\frac{a}{2} - 0} = -\frac{2b}{a}\).
   - Perpendicular slope is \(\frac{a}{2b}\).
   - Equation: \(y = \frac{a}{2b}x\).

4. **Bisector of \(OD\):**
   - Midpoint of \(OD\) is \(\left(-\frac{a}{2}, 0\right)\).
   - Slope of \(OD\) is \(\frac{0 - b}{-\frac{a}{2} - 0} = \frac{2b}{a}\).
   - Perpendicular slope is \(-\frac{a}{2b}\).
   - Equation: \(y = -\frac{a}{2b}x\).

### Step 2: Region of Points Closer to \(O\)
The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the area inside the rectangle but outside the four bisectors. This region forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle.

### Step 3: Dimensions of the Smaller Rectangle
The smaller rectangle is formed by the intersection of the regions defined by the inequalities:
- \(|x| < \frac{a}{2}\)
- \(|y| < \frac{b}{2}\)

Thus, the dimensions of the smaller rectangle are:
- Length: \(a\)
- Width: \(b\)

### Step 4: Area of the Smaller Rectangle
The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}} = \frac{a}{2} \times \frac{b}{2} = \frac{ab}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Area of the Original Rectangle
The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = a \times b
\]

### Step 6: Probability Calculation
The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{\frac{ab}{4}}{ab} = \frac{1}{4}

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

   - Coni earns $26.52, which is \(26.52 \times 10 = 265.2\) dimes.

   Adding these together:
   \[
   274.7 + 352.3 + 373.7 + 265.2
   \]

2. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add \(274.7\) and \(352.3\):
     \[
     274.7 + 352.3 = 627
     \]
   - Next, add \(627\) and \(373.7\):
     \[
     627 + 373.7 = 1000.7

   - Finally, add \(1000.7\) and \(265.2\):
     \[
     1000.7 + 265.2 = 1265.9
     \]

   So, the total earnings in dimes is \(1265.9\) dimes.

3. **Convert the total earnings to dollars:**
   - Since each dollar is equivalent to 10 dimes, we divide \(1265.9\) dimes by 10:
     \[
     1265.9 \div 10 = 126.59
     \]

   So, the total earnings in dollars is \(126.59\).

4. **Determine the remaining cents:**
   - The total earnings in dollars is \(126.59\), which is equivalent to \(126\) dollars and \(59\) cents.

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1

Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1

Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7

To verify, we can check the sums of the numbers in the third row, the columns, and the diagonals using \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the numbers in the third row is:

The sum of the numbers in the third column is:

The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally across the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The width of the field is 300 staples and the length is 400 staples. So, the distance Jim travels is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of the given expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest possible distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the remaining three points exactly once, we need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then find the minimum of these distances.

Let's consider each starting point and calculate the total distance for all possible routes.

**Starting from point \(A\):**
1. Route \(A \to B \to C \to D\):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
2. Route \(A \to B \to D \to C\):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13
   \]
3. Route \(A \to C \to B \to D\):
   \[
   AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
4. Route \(A \to C \to D \to B\):
   \[
   AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
   \]
5. Route \(A \to D \to B \to C\):
   \[
   AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
6. Route \(A \to D \to C \to B\):
   \[
   AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \(A\) is 13.

**Starting from point \(B\):**
1. Route \(B \to A \to C \to D\):
   \[
   BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16
   \]
2. Route \(B \to A \to D \to C\):
   \[
   BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
3. Route \(B \to C \to A \to D\):
   \[
   BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. Route \(B \to C \to D \to A\):
   \[
   BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]
5. Route \(B \to D \to A \to C\):
   \[
   BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
6. Route \(B \to D \to C \to A\):
   \[
   BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \(B\) is 13.

**Starting from point \(C\):**
1. Route \(C \to A \to B \to D\):
   \[
   CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15

3. Route \(C \to B \to A \to D\):
   \[
   CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. Route \(C \to B \to D \to A\):
   \[
   CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
5. Route \(C \to D \to A \to B\):
   \[
   CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]
6. Route \(C \to D \to B \to A\):
   \[
   CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is 13.

**Starting from point \(D\):**
1. Route \(D \to A \to B \to C\):
   \[
   DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
2. Route \(D \to A \to C \to B\):
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]
4. Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
5. Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
