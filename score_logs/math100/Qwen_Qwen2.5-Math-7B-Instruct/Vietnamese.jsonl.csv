"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) (which is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \)) gives:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i

   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c

   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11^2\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{11^2} = 11\), we can simplify this to:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a circular table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}
\]

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 7 \cdot 3 + 3\text{)}
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( 24 \) is divided by 7 is 3. Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides of the pentagon.

The angle of rotation for each symmetry of the pentagon is given by:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

This means that the pentagon will coincide with its original position after a rotation of 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and a full rotation of 360 degrees. The smallest positive angle among these is 72 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is:

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices as \(A = (5, 3)\), \(B = (6, 8)\), \(C = (7, 4)\), and \(D = (x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]
However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \((6, -1)\) cannot be the correct coordinates for \(D\). This means we need to consider the other possible pair of diagonals, \(AB\) and \(CD\), or \(AD\) and \(BC\).

Let's consider the diagonals \(AB\) and \(CD\). The midpoint of \(AB\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of \(CD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]
Setting these midpoints equal gives:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]
This does not satisfy \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the diagonals \(AD\) and \(BC\).

Let's consider the diagonals \(AD\) and \(BC\). The midpoint of \(AD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of \(BC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
Setting these midpoints equal gives:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]
This satisfies \(x > 7\), so the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). We need to find the value of \(\tan A\).

Given the equation \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:
\[

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is defined for all angles except where \(\cos A = 0\), which would make \(\sin A = 0\) and the triangle would degenerate), we can simplify the fraction:

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, specifically \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). However, we need to adjust the middle term to match the form. Instead, let's consider the expression in a different way by factoring out a common term from the first two terms:

Now, let's simplify inside the parentheses:
\[99(99 + 1) + 1 = 99 \cdot 100 + 1.\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[99 \cdot 100 = 9900.\]

Then, we add 1:

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the context of matrices, we have

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| \le \sqrt{\text{tr}(A^T A)} = \sqrt{4 + 13} = \sqrt{17}.
\]

To check if this bound is achievable, we need to find a vector \(\bold{v}\) such that \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{17}\). This occurs when \(\bold{v}\) is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 17\), but since \( A^T A \) has eigenvalues \(\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\), we need to check the maximum value directly.

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

Now we can combine the fractions:

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"Let's define the weight of a treek as \( T \), the weight of a squig as \( S \), and the weight of a goolee as \( G \). We are given two equations based on the problem statement:

1. Ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee:
\[ 10T = 3S + G \]

2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig:
\[ 2T + G = S \]

We need to find the number of treeks that weigh the same as one squig, so we need to express \( S \) in terms of \( T \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = S - 2T \]

\[ 10T = 4S - 2T \]
\[ 12T = 4S \]

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2

\[
a \cdot bt = abt

\[

\[

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):

\[

\[

\[

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[

Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):

We have found \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the given information about the volume of water being added and the rate at which the water level rises.

First, let's denote the radius of the base of the cylinder by \( r \) meters and the height of the cylinder by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of the cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We know that the volume of water being added to the tank is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. This means the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is:
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

Using the chain rule, we can relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Since the volume \( V \) is a function of the height \( h \), we have:
\[ \frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting this into the chain rule equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we solve for \( r \) by taking the square root of both sides:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is:
\[ \boxed{\sqrt{5}} \]","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both regions defined by the piecewise function.

The function \(f(x)\) is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the behavior of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this region occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases.

### Step 2: Analyze the behavior of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the function increases as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function decreases as \(x\) increases. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must include all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the region \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the region \(x < a\).

From the analysis above, we have:
- The minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\).
- The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\).

Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]

### Step 4: Solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\)
Rearrange the inequality:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factor out \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the product \(a(a - 2)(a + 1)\) is less than or equal to zero. We test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -1]\), \([-1, 0]\), \([0, 2]\), and \([2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0\).
- For \(a \in [-1, 0]\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \geq 0\).
- For \(a \in [0, 2]\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0\).
- For \(a \in [2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \geq 0\).

The inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) is satisfied in the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \([0, 2]\). Since we are looking for the maximum value of \(a\), we take the maximum value in the interval \([0, 2]\), which is \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) that makes the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to be in the standard form \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \), the right-hand side must equal the square of the radius. We are given that the radius is 1, so:
\[ 34 - c = 1^2 \]
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) that makes the circle have a radius of 1 is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold for some \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for solutions where \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find the other roots of the cubic equation.

By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots of the cubic equation are the factors of the constant term \(\lambda^2 - 1\) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient \(-\lambda^4\). The constant term \(\lambda^2 - 1\) can be factored as \((\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), and the leading coefficient is \(-\lambda^4\). The possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{\lambda}, \pm \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}, \pm \frac{\lambda + 1}{\lambda}\).

We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a root. Let's check if \(x = 1\) is a root:
\[
-\lambda^4 (1)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(1)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)(1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + 2\lambda^3 + \lambda^4 - \lambda^2 - \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^3 - 1.
\]
For \(x = 1\) to be a root, we need \(\lambda^3 - 1 = 0\), which gives \(\lambda = 1\). However, if \(\lambda = 1\), then \(f(x) = x\) for all \(x\), so there are no solutions where \(f(x) \neq x\).

Next, let's check if \(x = -1\) is a root:
\[
-\lambda^4 (-1)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(-1)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)(-1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^4 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) + \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^4 + 2\lambda^3 + \lambda^4 + \lambda^2 + \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 + \lambda^2 - 1 = 2\lambda^4 + 3\lambda^3 + 3\lambda^2 - 1.
\]
For \(x = -1\) to be a root, we need \(2\lambda^4 + 3\lambda^3 + 3\lambda^2 - 1 = 0\). This is a quartic equation, and we need to check if it has any real roots in the interval \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\).

By numerical methods or graphing, we find that the only real root of \(2\lambda^4 + 3\lambda^3 + 3\lambda^2 - 1 = 0\) in the interval \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) is approximately \(\lambda \approx 1.618\), which is the golden ratio \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\).

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can focus on the region where \( x \le y \) without loss of generality.

Next, we consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \]
\[ f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \) or \( x = 0 \), respectively. Thus, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \]
From \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \]
Multiplying both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \), we get:
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]
This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) as \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta \le 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \]
Thus, on the boundary of the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), the function \( f(x, y) \) is always equal to 1.

Since the function is continuous and we have checked the boundary and the critical points inside the region, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by determining the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). We are given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) can be found using the magnitude of the cross product of vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

We compute this determinant as follows:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplify each component:
\[
\mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
\]

Calculate each term inside the square root:
\[
8^2 = 64, \quad (-10)^2 = 100, \quad 4^2 = 16
\]

Add these values together:
\[
64 + 100 + 16 = 180
\]

Take the square root of the sum:
\[
\sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is:
\[
\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore, we find:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{-2}. \]","[-2, '-2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by noting that \( G \) is the centroid of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Given that \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through \( G \), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line segment parallel to the base. Since \( G \) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the distance from \( A \) to \( BC \).

Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is:
\[
\left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}
\]

Given that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64
\]

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \( ENG \). Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides triangle \( ABC \) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these smaller triangles is:
\[
\text{Area of each smaller triangle} = \frac{144}{3} = 48
\]

Triangle \( ENG \) is one of these smaller triangles. Thus, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the fraction of the remaining mathematics books on the three shelves after taking out two books from each shelf, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial number of books on each shelf.
   - Top shelf: 8 mathematics books.
   - Middle shelf: 10 mathematics books.
   - Bottom shelf: 6 mathematics books.

2. Calculate the number of mathematics books left on each shelf after taking out two books from each shelf.
   - Top shelf: \(8 - 2 = 6\) mathematics books.
   - Middle shelf: \(10 - 2 = 8\) mathematics books.
   - Bottom shelf: \(6 - 2 = 4\) mathematics books.

3. Find the total number of mathematics books left on all three shelves.
   \[
   6 + 8 + 4 = 18
   \]

4. Determine the total number of books left on all three shelves after taking out two books from each shelf. Since each shelf originally had a total of 8, 10, and 6 books respectively, and we took out 2 books from each shelf, the total number of books taken out is:
   \[
   2 + 2 + 2 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of books left is:
   \[
   24 - 6 = 18
   \]

5. Calculate the fraction of the remaining mathematics books out of the total remaining books.
   \[
   \frac{18}{18} = 1
   \]

However, the correct total number of books left on all three shelves after taking out two books from each shelf is:
   \[
   24 - 6 = 18
  ]

Therefore the correct fraction of the remaining mathematics books out of the total remaining books is:
   \[
   \frac{18}{18} = 1

 correct answer is:
   \boxed{1}

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \]

where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cone. We are given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]

First, we multiply the area of the base by the height:

\[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{1}{3}\):

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = 65 \]

Therefore, the volume of the cone is:

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now that we have \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term (\(a_6\)) using the general formula:

\[a_6 = a_1 + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 375\]
\[a_6 = 350\]

Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",350,"[350, '350']",True
"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a finite decimal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the denominator**: The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\). We can rewrite this as \(4 \cdot 78125\), but it is more useful to keep it in its prime factorized form for now.

2. **Adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator**: To convert the fraction into a decimal, we need the denominator to be a power of 10. A power of 10 is of the form \(2^a \cdot 5^a\). Therefore, we need to make the exponents of 2 and 5 in the denominator equal. The exponent of 2 is 2 and the exponent of 5 is 7. To make them equal, we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) (since \(2^5 = 32\)).

   \[
   \frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 2^5} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{2^7 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}
   \]

3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal**: Now that the denominator is \(10^7\), we can write the fraction as a decimal by placing the numerator 672 in a decimal with 7 digits after the decimal point.

   \[
   \frac{672}{10^7} = 0.0000672

Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) as a finite decimal is \(\boxed{0.0000672}\).","[6.72000000000000e-5, '0.0000672']",.0000672,"[6.72000000000000e-5, '0.0000672']",True
"To determine how many two-digit numbers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers and then identify all two-digit divisors of the GCD.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime that appears in both factorizations:
\[
\text{GCD}(100, 150) = 2^1 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

Next, we list all the divisors of 50:
\[
1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50
\]

From this list, we identify the two-digit divisors:
\[
10, 25, 50
\]

There are 3 two-digit divisors of 50. Therefore, the number of two-digit numbers that are divisors of both 100 and 150 is:

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) make \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( (2^k)^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:
\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

There are 7 divisors in this list. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of 10-xu coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of 5-xu coins.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Hillary has a total of 11 coins.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 xu.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following system of equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 10x + 5y = 75 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2x + y = 15 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 2x + y = 15 \)

Next, we can eliminate \( y \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2x + y - x - y = 4 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Now that we know \( x = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( y \):
\[ 4 + y = 11 \]
\[ y = 11 - 4 \]
\[ y = 7 \]

So, Hillary has 7 coins of 5 xu. Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. They are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and the rest are odd numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number. Since there are 6 choices for Paul and 6 choices for Jesse, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only 1 even number, so there is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) way for both Paul and Jesse to choose an even number.

For the second scenario, there are 5 odd numbers, so there are \(5 \times 5 = 25\) ways for both Paul and Jesse to choose an odd number.

Adding these two scenarios together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[
1 + 25 = 26
\]

The probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
\frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}
\]

Thus, the probability is:
\[

"To find the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \). This will give us \( 3(4) + 2y = 12 \).
2. Simplify the left side of the equation: \( 3(4) = 12 \), so the equation becomes \( 12 + 2y = 12 \).
3. Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( y \): \( 12 + 2y - 12 = 12 - 12 \), which simplifies to \( 2y = 0 \).
4. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( y \): \( \frac{2y}{2} = \frac{0}{2} \), which simplifies to \( y = 0 \).

Therefore, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To determine the total area of the shaded regions in the given figure, we need to analyze the geometry of the shapes involved. The figure consists of a large rectangle formed by twelve 1x1 squares, with two triangular regions shaded.

First, let's calculate the area of the large rectangle. Since it is formed by twelve 1x1 squares, the area is:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the two shaded triangles. The first shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\). This is a right triangle with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units. The area of a triangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values for the base and height, we get:
\[
\text{Area of the first triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

The second shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\). This is also a right triangle with a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units. Using the same formula for the area of a triangle, we get:
\[
\text{Area of the second triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units}
\]

To find the total area of the shaded regions, we add the areas of the two triangles:
\[
4 + 6 = 10 \text{ square units}
\]

Thus, the total area of the shaded regions is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 such that all its digits are either 0 or 1, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 (to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\)), and it must have an even number of 1's (to satisfy the factor of 2). Additionally, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3 (to satisfy the factor of \(3^2\)).

Let's start by trying the smallest possible numbers that end in 00 and have an even number of 1's:

1. 100: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 0 + 0 = 1\), which is not a multiple of 3.
2. 1100: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2\), which is not a multiple of 3.
3. 11100: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is a multiple of 3.

Since 11100 satisfies all the conditions (it ends in 00, has an even number of 1's, and the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3), it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 such that all its digits are either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

\[

"To determine the probability that a chess piece is placed on a black square of the chessboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the possible remainders for each number:**
   - When the first number is divided by 4, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3. This means there are 3 possible choices for the column.
   - When the second number is divided by 5, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4. This means there are 4 possible choices for the row.

2. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Since each number is chosen independently, the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of choices for the column and the number of choices for the row.
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12
   \]
   So, there are 12 possible positions on the chessboard where the chess piece can be placed.

3. **Determine the number of black squares on the chessboard:**
   - A standard chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, making a total of 64 squares.
   - Half of these squares are black and half are white.
   \[
   \frac{64}{2} = 32
   \]
   So, there are 32 black squares on the chessboard.

4. **Calculate the probability that the chess piece is placed on a black square:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (black squares) divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   \[
   \frac{32}{64} = \frac{1}{2}

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Thus, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result that \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\), which we already used. Therefore, we have:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[

"To determine the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis,
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane,
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

In other words, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\). This plane extends infinitely in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \(c\) in the \(z\)-direction.

Therefore, the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane.

"To find the smallest angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians). Since we are asked for the smallest angle, the answer is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) \]

Let \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) be the roots of \( f(x) \). Then, by definition:
\[ f(r_1) = 0, \quad f(r_2) = 0, \quad f(r_3) = 0 \]

Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = 0 \]

This implies:
\[ f(x + 5) = 0 \]

Therefore, \( x + 5 \) must be one of the roots of \( f(x) \). Let:
\[ x + 5 = r_1, \quad x + 5 = r_2, \quad x + 5 = r_3 \]

Solving for \( x \) in each case, we get:
\[ x = r_1 - 5, \quad x = r_2 - 5, \quad x = r_3 - 5 \]

Thus, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we add these roots together:
\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) \]

Simplifying this expression, we get:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 \]

Next, we need to determine the sum of the roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) of the polynomial \( f(x) \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( a_n x^3 + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots taken one at a time is given by:
\[ -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are:
\[ a_3 = 1, \quad a_2 = -49, \quad a_1 = 623, \quad a_0 = -2015 \]

Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) is:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Substituting this back into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34 \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

Let \(t = \tan 20^\circ\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
t^3 - 3\sqrt{3}t^2 - 3t + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

We can factor this polynomial as:

\[
(t - \sqrt{3})(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1) = 0.
\]

The roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1 = 0\) are:

\[
t = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{12 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm 4}{2} = \sqrt{3} \pm 2.
\]

Since \(\tan 20^\circ\) is positive and less than \(\sqrt{3}\), we have \(\tan 20^\circ = \sqrt{3} - 2\). Therefore, \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} - 2} = -\sqrt{3} - 2\).

We also know that \(\tan 10^\circ = \tan (30^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 30^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(\sqrt{3} - 2)} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \sqrt{3} + 2}{1 + 1 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\frac{1 - 3 + 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}}{2 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{3} - 2}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{2\sqrt{3} - 2}{\sqrt{3}}} = 1\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ = 1\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ = (-\sqrt{3} - 2)^2 = 3 + 4\sqrt{3} + 4 = 7 + 4\sqrt{3}\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ)}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} - 2)}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{1 + 3 - 2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{4 - 2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2 - \sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{1}\right)^2 = (2 + \sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4\sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + (7 + 4\sqrt{3}) + (7 + 4\sqrt{3}) = 15 + 8\sqrt{3}\).

Finally, we substitute this back into the expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 15 + 8\sqrt{3} = 18 + 8\sqrt{3}.

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles minus one angle is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles minus one angle is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(A\) be the measure of the angle that is subtracted. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - A = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express \(A\) in terms of \(S\):**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \(A\):
   \[
   A = S - 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Substitute the formula for \(S\) into the equation:**
   Substitute \(S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ\) into the equation for \(A\):
   \[
   A = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

5. **Determine the range of \(A\):**
   Since \(A\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   0^\circ < A < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Set up inequalities and solve for \(n\):**
   Substitute the expression for \(A\) into the inequality:
   \[
   0^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

   Break this into two separate inequalities:
   \[
   0^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

7. **Solve the first inequality:**
   \[
   0^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

8. **Solve the second inequality:**
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

9. **Combine the results:**
   From both inequalities, we have:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, \(n = 8\).

This simplifies to:

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

"To find the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \(1\) cubic foot is equal to \(12 \times 12 \times 12 = 1728\) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by \(V = s^3\), where \(s\) is the side length.
   - Given \(V = 1728\) cubic inches, we solve for \(s\):
     \[
     s^3 = 1728
     \]
     Taking the cube root of both sides:
     \[
     s = \sqrt[3]{1728} = 12 \text{ inches}

3. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   - The surface area \(A\) of a cube is given by \(A = 6s^2\), where \(s\) is the side length.
   - Substituting \(s = 12\) inches:
     \[
     A = 6 \times (12)^2

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to determine what the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is. The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

"To find the distance between two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\) and the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\):

\[
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.

Using the determinant formula for the cross product, we get:

\[

\]

Simplifying each component:

\[
\mathbf{i}((-45) - (-14)) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) = \mathbf{i}(-31),
\]
\[
-\mathbf{j}((10) - (16)) = -\mathbf{j}(10 - 16) = -\mathbf{j}(-6) = \mathbf{j}(6),
\]
\[
\mathbf{k}((14) - (72)) = \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{k}(-58).
\]

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[

\]

Next, we apply the distributive property again to each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a},
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}).
\]

We can use the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, which states that for any scalar \(k\) and vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\),

\[
(k \mathbf{u}) \times \mathbf{v} = k (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (k \mathbf{v}) = k (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}).
\]

Applying this property, we get:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem which states:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD}
\]
Let \(AB = x\). Then:
\[
\frac{x}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h
\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(h = CD = c\). Therefore:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c
\]
We know that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times c
\]

To find \(d\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
d^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 = a^2 + c^2
\]

We also know from the Angle Bisector Theorem that:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{\frac{ab}{c}}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies \frac{b}{c} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
This confirms our setup is consistent.

Now, we need to express \(d\) in terms of \(a\) and \(c\). Since \(d\) is the hypotenuse of \(\triangle ACD\), we have:
\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + c^2}
\]

Substituting \(d\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} \times c
\]

We need to find the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) to \(ABCD\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[ABCD]} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} \times c}{\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{a + b}
\]

From the given area of \(ABCD\), we know:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

We need to find the ratio of \(\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}\) to \(a + b\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we use the properties of the angle bisector and the right triangle to find:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{a + b} = \frac{c}{a + b}
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[ABCD]} = \frac{c}{a + b} = \frac{c}{c} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[

We can simplify the fraction \(\frac{70 \times 21}{30}\) by canceling out the common factors. Notice that \(70\) and \(30\) have a common factor of \(10\):

\[
\frac{70 \times 21}{30} = \frac{(70 \div 10) \times 21}{30 \div 10} = \frac{7 \times 21}{3}
\]

Now, we calculate \(7 \times 21\):

\[
7 \times 21 = 147

So, the fraction becomes:

We can simplify \(\frac{147}{3}\) by dividing \(147\) by \(3\):

\[

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one segment crosses the other. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, the points must alternate between the two segments. For example, if the points are labeled in order as \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\), then the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we can fix one point and arrange the remaining 3 points. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining points. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = 3! = 6
   \]

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: As mentioned earlier, for the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must alternate. There are 2 possible alternating arrangements: \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) and \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Thus, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
\]

According to the problem, the total area of the shaded regions is:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to determine the areas of the shaded regions in the smaller and larger circles separately.

### Area of the Shaded Region in the Smaller Circle
The smaller circle has a radius of 1. The area of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times (1)^2 = \pi
\]

The shaded region in the smaller circle consists of a sector with angle \(\theta\) and a triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and the included angle:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DC \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)
\]

Thus, the area of the shaded region in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Shaded area in the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)
\]

### Area of the Shaded Region in the Larger Circle
The larger circle has a radius of 2. The area of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = 4\pi
\]

The shaded region in the larger circle consists of a sector with angle \(\theta\) and a triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is the same as in the smaller circle:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)
\]

Thus, the area of the shaded region in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Shaded area in the larger circle} = 2\theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)
\]

### Total Shaded Area
The total shaded area is the sum of the shaded areas in both circles:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \left( \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) \right) + \left( 2\theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) \right) = \frac{\theta}{2} + 2\theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) = \frac{5\theta}{2} - \sin(\theta)
\]

We know this total shaded area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} - \sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we can use numerical methods or trigonometric identities. By inspection or using a calculator, we find that:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

Thus, the number of degrees of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 120^\circ
\]

Therefore, the number of degrees of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical bottles are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical bottle and the spherical tank and then divide the volume of the tank by the volume of the bottle.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical bottle. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical bottle, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical bottles are required to fill the spherical tank. We do this by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical bottle:
\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4

Therefore, the number of cylindrical bottles needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and we need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Multiplying these two expressions together, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so it simplifies to:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

We know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100, so we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[
\frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   \[
   20 \text{ feet per minute} \times 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 240 \text{ inches per minute}

"To determine the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a board consisting of 8 members from the Communist Party and 6 members from the D circ Party, with the condition that the committee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the committee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a committee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a committee consisting only of members from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from the 14 members of the board. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that consists only of members from the Communist Party. This is given by \(\binom{8}{5}\):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Similarly, calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that consists only of members from the D circ Party. This is given by \(\binom{6}{5}\):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that does not meet the condition (i.e., a committee consisting only of members from one party) is the sum of the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from the Communist Party and the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from the D circ Party:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, subtract the number of ways to form a committee that does not meet the condition from the total number of ways to form a committee:

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

The average of these three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product of the three integers divided by their average is 24. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24

This can be rewritten as:

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

The three consecutive integers are \( -6, -5, \) and \( -4 \). The product of these integers is:

\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result. Therefore, we have:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\).

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we know that \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

Since \( D \) is a point on \( AM \) with \( AD = 10 \), it follows that \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

We are given that \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), we can use the Law of Cosines to express \( BC \) in terms of \( BD \), \( DC \), and \( \cos(3\theta) \):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(3\theta).
\]
Since \( BD = DC = \sqrt{AB^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 100} \), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
(2x)^2 = (\sqrt{AB^2 - 100})^2 + (\sqrt{AB^2 - 100})^2 - 2 \cdot (\sqrt{AB^2 - 100}) \cdot (\sqrt{AB^2 - 100}) \cdot \cos(3\theta),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4x^2 = 2(AB^2 - 100) - 2(AB^2 - 100)\cos(3\theta),
\]
or
\[
4x^2 = 2(AB^2 - 100)(1 - \cos(3\theta)).
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
2x^2 = (AB^2 - 100)(1 - \cos(3\theta)).
\]

Next, we use the triple angle identity for cosine, which states that \( \cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta) \). Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
2x^2 = (AB^2 - 100)(1 - (4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta))) = (AB^2 - 100)(4\cos^3(\theta) - 2\cos(\theta)) = 2(AB^2 - 100)\cos(\theta)(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1).
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
x^2 = (AB^2 - 100)\cos(\theta)(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1).
\]

Now, we use the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \) to express \( AB \) in terms of \( x \) and \( \cos(\theta) \):
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Substituting \( AB^2 = 121 + x^2 \) into the equation \( x^2 = (AB^2 - 100)\cos(\theta)(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1) \), we get:
\[
x^2 = (121 + x^2 - 100)\cos(\theta)(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1) = (21 + x^2)\cos(\theta)(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x^2 = (21 + x^2)(2\cos^3(\theta) - \cos(\theta)),
\]
or
\[
x^2 = 42\cos^3(\theta) - 21\cos(\theta) + 2x^2\cos^3(\theta) - x^2\cos(\theta).
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2x^2\cos^3(\theta) + x^2\cos(\theta) = 42\cos^3(\theta) - 21\cos(\theta),
\]
or
\[
x^2(1 - 2\cos^3(\theta) + \cos(\theta)) = 42\cos^3(\theta) - 21\cos(\theta).
\]
Factoring out \( \cos(\theta) \) on the right side, we get:
\[
x^2(1 - 2\cos^3(\theta) + \cos(\theta)) = 21\cos(\theta)(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1).
\]
Since \( 1 - 2\cos^3(\theta) + \cos(\theta) = (1 - \cos(\theta))(1 + 2\cos(\theta)) \), we can cancel out \( 1 - \cos(\theta) \) from both sides (assuming \( \cos(\theta) \neq 1 \)):
\[
x^2(1 + 2\cos(\theta)) = 21\cos(\theta)(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1).
\]
If we test \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \), we get:
\[
x^2\left(1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right) = 21 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 1\right),

which simplifies to:
\[
x^2 \cdot 2 = 21 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 1\right) = 21 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2} - 1\right) = 21 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 21 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{4}\right) = -\frac{21}{4}.
\]
This is not possible, so we need to re-eide the correct value. correct value is \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Finally, we find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + 121} = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2},
\]
and
\[
BC = 2x = 2 \cdot 11 = 22.
\]
Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{2} + 11\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22(\sqrt{2} + 1).
\]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the 27 integers is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a + 13\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
The median of the sequence is the 14th term, which is:
\[
a + 13
\]
Since we have already calculated that \(a + 13 = 81\), the median of the sequence is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, let's make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \]

We can factor this quadratic equation:
\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

So, the solutions to the equation are:
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(y\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the root \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \).

- For \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is true in the interval \( (-\infty, 3) \).

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is false in the interval \( (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \( y = x^2 \), so we convert this back to \( x \):
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answer

Combining the results from both steps, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of two variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has the number of male students going by bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female students going by bus, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female students in each class and then compare it to the number of male students in that class.

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female students in each class. Since there are 300 female students in each class, we have:
\[ 135\% \text{ of } 300 = 1.35 \times 300 = 405 \]

Now, we will compare the number of male students in each class to 405.

1. **LỚp \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\):**
   - Number of male students: \(41.1\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 123.3 = 281.7\)

2. **LỚp \(10^{\mathrm{th}}\):**
   - Number of male students: \(34.4\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 103.2 = 301.8\)

3. **LỚp \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\):**
   - Number of male students: \(20.6\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)

   - Number of male students: \(11.6\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 34.8 = 370.2\)

From the calculations, we can see that the smallest difference is 281.7, which corresponds to LỚp \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is equal to \((x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x-9)(x+9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \((x-9)(x+9)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so \(x(x-36) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).

We need to find the intervals where the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative. We will consider each case for the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 < 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 > 0\), the quotient is positive.

We also need to check the points where the numerator or the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), and the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"To find the maximum area of the rectangular field enclosed by the running track, we start by analyzing the given information. The running track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two half-circles. The total length of the running track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two half-circles have a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, which is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total length of the running track can be expressed as the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two half-circles:
\[
2L + 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times \frac{W}{2} \right) = 2L + \pi W
\]
We know this total length is 400 meters, so we can set up the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

Next, we solve for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W
\]
\[
200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)
\]
\[
L = 200 - 100
\]
\[
L = 100
\]

Finally, we calculate the maximum area \( A \):
\[
A = L \times W
\]
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}

Thus, the maximum area of the rectangular field is:

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[
\frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
\[
ST = 2

\[

\[

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \(2x\):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm\sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

1. For \(x = 0\):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \(x = \sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2
\]

Substitute these values back into the function:

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Since \((- \sqrt{2})^4 = 4\) and \((- \sqrt{2})^2 = 2\), we get:

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

The distance is expressed in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]

"Given a regular octahedron with vertices \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) and a point \(P\) such that the distances from \(P\) to these vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex.

First, recall that a regular octahedron can be inscribed in a cube. Let the side length of the cube be \(s\). The vertices of the octahedron are at the midpoints of the faces of the cube. Without loss of generality, we can place the cube in a coordinate system with vertices at \((\pm s/2, \pm s/2, \pm s/2)\). The vertices of the octahedron are then \((\pm s/2, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm s/2, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm s/2)\).

Let the coordinates of \(P\) be \((x, y, z)\). The distances from \(P\) to the vertices are given by:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3,
\]
\[
\sqrt{\left(x + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2} = 8,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \left(y + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2} = 9,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2} = 11.
\]

We need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex, which is \((0, 0, s/2)\). This distance is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2}.
\]

To find \(s\), we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant and equal to \(3s^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\). Therefore, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d^2 = 3s^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2),
\]
where \(d\) is the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex. Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d^2 = 3s^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).
\]
\[
324 + d^2 = 3s^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).
\]

We also know that:
\[
\left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
\left(x + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49,
\]
\[
x^2 + \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 64,
\]
\[
x^2 + \left(y + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 81,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 121.
\]

Adding these equations, we get:
\[
\left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + \left(x + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + x^2 + x^2 + x^2 + y^2 + y^2 + y^2 + z^2 + z^2 + z^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + \left(z + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d^2.
\]
\[
3x^2 + 3y^2 + 3z^2 + s^2 + s^2 + s^2 + s^2 + s^2 + s^2 = 324 + d^2.
\]
\[
3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 6s^2 = 324 + d^2.
\]

Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:
\[
324 + d^2 = 3s^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 3s^2 + (324 + d^2 - 6s^2) = 324 + d^2 - 3s^2.
\]
\[
3s^2 = 6s^2.
\]
\[
3s^2 = 3s^2.
\]

This confirms our setup. Now, we can solve for \(d\):
\[
d^2 = 145.
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{145}.
\]

Thus, the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex is \(\boxed{\sqrt{145}}\).","[sqrt(145), '\\sqrt{145}']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"The formula for force is given by \( F = m \cdot a \), where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. According to the problem, Jen wants to throw a soft ball with the same force as Jack throws a baseball. Let's denote the force by \( F \), the mass of the soft ball by \( m_s \), the mass of the baseball by \( m_b \), the acceleration of the soft ball by \( a_s \), and the acceleration of the baseball by \( a_b \).

We know that the force exerted by Jen on the soft ball is equal to the force exerted by Jack on the baseball, so we can write:
\[ F = m_s \cdot a_s = m_b \cdot a_b \]

We are given the masses of the soft ball and the baseball:
\[ m_s = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_b = 150 \text{ g} \]

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 200 \cdot a_s = 150 \cdot a_b \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \):
\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:
\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball is:

"To determine how many digits are the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:

- \(1165_8\) has the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

"To determine the total number of handshakes that occurred at the meeting, we need to consider the interactions between the students and the teachers. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of students and teachers:**
   - There are 5 students.
   - There are 10 teachers.

2. **Determine the handshakes between students and teachers:**
   - Each student shakes hands with each teacher.
   - Therefore, the number of handshakes between students and teachers is calculated by multiplying the number of students by the number of teachers:
     \[
     5 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ teachers} = 50 \text{ handshakes}
     \]

3. **Determine the handshakes among the teachers:**
   - Each teacher shakes hands with every other teacher.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 teachers out of 10 to shake hands is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the total number of teachers:
     \[
     \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45 \text{ handshakes}

4. **Calculate the total number of handshakes:**
   - Add the number of handshakes between students and teachers to the number of handshakes among the teachers:
     \[
     50 \text{ handshakes} + 45 \text{ handshakes} = 95 \text{ handshakes}

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). By rearranging terms, we get:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we have:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 0 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). We can rewrite this equation as:

\[x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + x + \alpha)(x^2 + x + \beta) = 0,\]

where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are constants to be determined. By expanding the right-hand side, we get:

\[x^4 + x^3 + \alpha x^2 + x^3 + x^2 + \beta x + \alpha x^2 + \alpha x + \alpha \beta = x^4 + 2x^3 + (\alpha + \beta + 1)x^2 + (\alpha + \beta)x + \alpha \beta.\]

By comparing coefficients with the original polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\), we obtain the system of equations:

\[\alpha + \beta + 1 = 0,\]
\[\alpha + \beta = 0,\]
\[\alpha \beta = 2.\]

From the second equation, we have \(\alpha + \beta = 0\), so \(\beta = -\alpha\). Substituting \(\beta = -\alpha\) into the first equation, we get:

\[\alpha - \alpha + 1 = 0 \implies 1 = 0,\]

which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the fact that the roots of the polynomial can be expressed in terms of complex numbers. Let's assume the roots are of the form \(r, s, t, u\). By Vieta's formulas, we know:

\[r + s + t + u = -2,\]
\[rs + rt + ru + st + su + tu = 0,\]
\[rst + rsu + rtu + stu = 0,\]

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively. Then:

\[A + B + C = (r+s)(t+u) + (r+t)(s+u) + (r+u)(s+t).\]

Using the identity \((r+s)(t+u) + (r+t)(s+u) + (r+u)(s+t) = (r+s+t+u)^2 - (rs + rt + ru + st + su + tu)\), we substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:

\[A + B + C = (-2)^2 - 0 = 4.\]

Next, we need to find the product \(ABC\). We have:

\[ABC = (r+s)(t+u)(r+t)(s+u)(r+u)(s+t) = [(r+s)(t+u)(r+t)(s+u)(r+u)(s+t)] = [(rs + rt + ru + st + su + tu)^2 - 2rstu(r+s+t+u) - (rst + rsu + rtu + stu)^2 + 2rstu(r+t)(s+u)(r+u)(s+t)] = 0^2 - 2(-2)(-2) - 0^2 + 2(-2)(-2) = 0 - 8 + 8 = 0.\]

Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is the set of roots of the polynomial \(x^3 - 4x = 0\), which factors as:

The condition that a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed using the Euclidean distance formula. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + y^2}\), to \(B\) is \(\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + y^2}\), to \(C\) is \(\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\), and to \(D\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\).

For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:

Simplifying, we find:
\[

Similarly, for \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(B\), we need:
\[

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + y^2

Simplifying, we find:
\[
x^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 \implies 2ax < a^2 \implies x < \frac{a}{2}

Since \(a = kb\), we substitute \(a\) with \(kb\):
\[
-2(kb)x < (kb)^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2kbx < k^2b^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2kx < k^2b + 2y + b \implies kx > -\frac{k^2b + b}{2} - y \implies kx > -\frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2} - y

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have left after converting their total earnings into xunits, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's add them step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, the total earnings are:
   \[
   \$126.59
   \]

2. **Convert the total earnings into xunits:**
   - Each xunit is worth \$10.
   - To find out how many xunits they have, we divide the total earnings by 10:
   \[
   \frac{126.59}{10} = 12.659
   \]

   Since they can only convert whole xunits, they will get 12 xunits.

3. **Calculate the total value of the xunits converted:**
   - Each xunit is worth \$10.
   - Therefore, the total value of 12 xunits is:
   \[
   12 \times 10 = 120
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining money:**
   - Subtract the total value of the xunits converted from the total earnings:
   \[
   126.59 - 120 = 6.59
   \]

   So, the remaining money is:
   \[
   \$6.59
   \]

Thus, the amount of money they have left after converting their total earnings into xunits is \(\boxed{6.59}\).","[6.59000000000000, '6.59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score of all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score. We do this by multiplying the number of students who got each score by the score itself and then adding these products together.

The total score for the students who got 80 points is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The total score for the students who got 90 points is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The total score for the students who got 100 points is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add these scores together to get the total score for the entire class:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the average score of the class is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The first row is:
\[
(7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]

The second row is:
\[
(7+2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]

The third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

The first column is:
\[
(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

The main diagonal from top-right to bottom-left is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our solution is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet Jim goes less than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally across the rectangular island. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The formula is:

\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width of the rectangle. For Jim's path, the length \( l \) is 400 feet and the width \( w \) is 300 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \text{ feet} \]

So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha goes dẫ theo the length and the width of the rectangle. Therefore, the total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:

\[ \text{Distance} = l + w \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 400 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 700 \text{ feet} \]

So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:

\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Jim goes less than Martha by \(\boxed{200}\) feet.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only value that the expression can take is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
