"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \), we get:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"":** Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks around the table:** The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:** Within the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block, there are 3 people who can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. So, the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results:** The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of ways is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}
\]

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}

Thus,

\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular hexagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to consider the symmetry of the hexagon. A regular hexagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a hexagon (\(n=6\)), the sum of the interior angles is:
\[
(6-2) \times 180^\circ = 4 \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ
\]
However, we are interested in the angles of rotation that will return the hexagon to its original position. Since the hexagon has 6 equal sides, it can be divided into 6 equal parts. Therefore, the angle of rotation that will return the hexagon to its original position is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
\]
This means that the hexagon will look the same after being rotated by 60 degrees, 120 degrees, 180 degrees, 240 degrees, 300 degrees, and 360 degrees. The smallest positive angle of rotation that will return the hexagon to its original position is 60 degrees.

Thus, the minimum number of degrees the hexagon must be rotated to return to its original position is \(\boxed{60}\).","[60, '60']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 6 \) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering another pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonals \( AB \) and \( CD \) instead.

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AB \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( CD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \impl mod 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 4 \) is not a valid solution.

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in a straightforward manner, we can use algebraic manipulation. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that makes it easier to compute.

First, observe that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1 = 100^2 - 1^2 + 100 - 1 + 1\]

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that:

Next, add the numbers together:

for all two-dimensional vectors \(\mathbf{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\mathbf{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \mathbf{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \mathbf{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \mathbf{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13 \implies \frac{6y}{x} - \frac{6x}{y} = 9 \implies \frac{6y^2 - 6x^2}{xy} = 9 \implies \frac{6(y^2 - x^2)}{xy} = 9 \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
y = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = -\frac{1}{2}x.
\]

We substitute these back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. If \( y = 2x \), then \( x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore, \( y = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). The corresponding vectors are \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \\ \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \\ -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \end{pmatrix} \). For these vectors,

\[
\left\| A \mathbf{v} \right\| = \sqrt{4\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right) + 13\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5}} = \sqrt{\frac{80}{5}} = \sqrt{16} = 4.
\]

2. If \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x \), then \( x^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}x\right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{1}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies \frac{5}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore, \( y = \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). The corresponding vectors are \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \end{pmatrix} \). For these vectors,

\[
\left\| A \mathbf{v} \right\| = \sqrt{4\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right) + 13\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{5}} = \sqrt{1} = 1.
\]

The maximum value of \(\left\| A \mathbf{v} \right\|\) is 4. Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) is

\boxed{4}.

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**

   For \(58_9\):
   \[
   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   For \(18_9\):

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of a single treek in terms of the weight of a squig. Let's define the weight of a treek as \( T \), the weight of a squig as \( S \), and the weight of a goolee as \( G \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. A treek treeks weeg soveel as three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee is gelyk in weight to one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to eliminate \( G \) to find the relationship between \( T \) and \( S \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
T = 3S + S - 2T
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
T = 4S - 2T

Add \( 2T \) to both sides of the equation:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

The expansion of \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\) is given by:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
Expanding each term, we get:
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]
This gives us the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

We start by solving the fourth equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the second equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8

This is correct.

Finally, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the third equation to verify:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

This is also correct.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information: the volume of water being added to the tank is \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius of the base and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. The rate of change of the volume with respect to time, \(\frac{dV}{dt}\), is given as \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour. The rate of change of the height with respect to time, \(\frac{dh}{dt}\), is given as 4 meters per hour. Using the chain rule, we can relate these rates as follows:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both regions defined by the piecewise function.

The function \(f(x)\) is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the quadratic part \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
The quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). For \(x \geq a\), the minimum value of \(ax^2\) occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
If \(a > 0\), then \(a^3 > 0\), and as \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(\infty\), \(ax^2\) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\).

If \(a < 0\), then \(a^3 < 0\), and as \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(\infty\), \(ax^2\) decreases without bound. Therefore, the range of \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\).

### Step 2: Analyze the linear part \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
The linear function \(ax + 2a\) is a straight line with slope \(a\). For \(x < a\), the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]
If \(a > 0\), then the line \(ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) decreases from \(a\) to \(-\infty\), and it approaches \(-\infty\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).

If \(a < 0\), then the line \(ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases from \(a\) to \(-\infty\), and it approaches \(\infty\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the union of the ranges of the two pieces must cover all real numbers. This means that the ranges must overlap or be adjacent.

If \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) is \([a^3, \infty)\) and the range of \(f(x)\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For these ranges to cover all real numbers, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we get:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2]\) and \((2, \infty)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find that the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) is satisfied in the interval \((0, 2]\).

If \(a < 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\) and the range of \(f(x)\) is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\). For these ranges to cover all real numbers, we need:
\[ a^2 + 2a \leq a^3. \]
Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we get:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \((-1, 0)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find that the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\) is satisfied in the interval \((-\infty, -1]\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) that makes the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the cubic equation has a root in \([0,1]\) that is not equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its iterates, we find that the only values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,4]\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2\) has a fixed point at \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The iterate \(f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 4x^4) = 2(2x - 6x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^4) = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4\) has a root at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) but also has a root at \(x = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\), which are not equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

"To solve for the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) where

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]

By symmetry and trigonometric identities, we find that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \tan 35^\circ.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(0, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y \]
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = x \]
The maximum value of \( y \) and \( x \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \]
\[ 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \]
\[ 4x^2 = 2 \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \]
Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into the function \( f(x, x) \), we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1 \]
Similarly, substituting \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into the function \( f(x, x) \), we get:
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1 \]
Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the line \( x = y \) is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points inside the region \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) that could give a value greater than 1. However, since the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric and the maximum value on the boundary and on the line \( x = y \) is 1, we conclude that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by determining the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). We are given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) can be found using the magnitude of the cross product of vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1

\]

We expand this determinant along the first row:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

Simplify each component:
\[

\]

Thus, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}

Calculate each term inside the square root:
\[
8^2 = 64, \quad (-10)^2 = 100, \quad 4^2 = 16

Add these values together:
\[

We can express \( z \) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{i\cdot17\pi} = e^{i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{i\pi} = (e^{i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{-i\pi} = (e^{-i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore,

\[ 1p + 10d + 5n = 75 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( p + d + n = 15 \)
2. \( p + 10d + 5n = 75 \)

To eliminate \( p \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (p + 10d + 5n) - (p + d + n) = 75 - 15 \]
\[ p + 10d + 5n - p - d - n = 60 \]
\[ 9d + 4n = 60 \]

Now we need to solve for \( n \). First, isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 4n = 60 - 9d \]
\[ n = \frac{60 - 9d}{4} \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, \( 60 - 9d \) must be divisible by 4. Let's check the possible values of \( d \) (which must also be a whole number) to find a value that makes \( 60 - 9d \) divisible by 4.

- If \( d = 0 \):
  \[ 60 - 9(0) = 60 \]
  \( 60 \div 4 = 15 \) (divisible by 4)

- If \( d = 1 \):
  \[ 60 - 9(1) = 51 \]
  \( 51 \div 4 = 12.75 \) (not divisible by 4)

- If \( d = 2 \):
  \[ 60 - 9(2) = 42 \]
  \( 42 \div 4 = 10.5 \) (not divisible by 4)

- If \( d = 3 \):
  \[ 60 - 9(3) = 33 \]
  \( 33 \div 4 = 8.25 \) (not divisible by 4)

- If \( d = 4 \):
  \[ 60 - 9(4) = 24 \]
  \( 24 \div 4 = 6 \) (divisible by 4)

- If \( d = 5 \):
  \[ 60 - 9(5) = 15 \]
  \( 15 \div 4 = 3.75 \) (not divisible by 4)

- If \( d = 6 \):
  \[ 60 - 9(6) = 6 \]
  \( 6 \div 4 = 1.5 \) (not divisible by 4)

- If \( d = 7 \):
  \[ 60 - 9(7) = -3 \]
  \( -3 \div 4 = -0.75 \) (not divisible by 4)

From the above calculations, the only values of \( d \) that make \( n \) a whole number are \( d = 0 \) and \( d = 4 \).

Let's check each case:

1. If \( d = 0 \):
   \[ n = \frac{60 - 9(0)}{4} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]
   \[ p + 0 + 15 = 15 \]
   \[ p = 0 \]
   This solution is valid.

2. If \( d = 4 \):
   \[ n = \frac{60 - 9(4)}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]
   \[ p + 4 + 6 = 15 \]
   \[ p = 5 \]
   This solution is also valid.

Since both solutions are valid, we need to determine which one fits the context of the problem. However, the problem does not specify any additional constraints to choose between the two solutions. Therefore, we can conclude that the number of nickels Hillary has is:

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse picks from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each pick a number. Since there are 6 choices for Paul and 6 choices for Jesse, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse pick an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse pick an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only 1 even number, so there is only 1 way for both Paul and Jesse to pick an even number:
\[ 1 \times 1 = 1 \]

For the second scenario, there are 5 odd numbers, so there are:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]
ways for both Paul and Jesse to pick an odd number.

Adding these two scenarios together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[ 1 + 25 = 26 \]

The probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse picks is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
\[ \frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18} \]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the getals what helle kies is even is:

"To find the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the point \((a, b)\) that lies on the line with the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\). Since \( a \) represents the \( x \)-coordinate, we replace \( x \) with 4.
   \[
   3(4) + 2y = 12
   \]

2. Simplify the left side of the equation.
   \[
   12 + 2y = 12

3. To isolate \( y \), subtract 12 from both sides of the equation.
   \[
   2y = 12 - 12

   \[
   2y = 0
   \]

4. Solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 2.

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram step by step.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   - The rectangle is formed by 12 unit squares.
   - Since each square has a side length of 1 unit, the dimensions of the rectangle are \(3\) units by \(4\) units.

2. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square units}

3. **Analyze the shaded regions:**
   - There are two shaded triangles in the diagram.
   - The first shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
   - The second shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((2, 0)\).

4. **Calculate the area of the first shaded triangle:**
   - The base of the first triangle is \(2\) units (from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\)).
   - The height of the first triangle is \(4\) units (from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\)).
   - The area of a triangle is given by:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must have at least two trailing zeros.

Next, we need to ensure that the remaining part of the number (after the trailing zeros) is a multiple of 2 and \(3^2 = 9\). Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the part of the number without the trailing zeros must be a binary number that is a multiple of 9.

Let's check the smallest binary numbers to see if they are multiples of 9:

- \(1_2 = 1_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(10_2 = 2_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(11_2 = 3_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(100_2 = 4_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(101_2 = 5_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(110_2 = 6_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(111_2 = 7_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(1000_2 = 8_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(1001_2 = 9_{10}\) (a multiple of 9)

The smallest binary number that is a multiple of 9 is \(1001_2\). Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1 is:

\[ 100100_2 = 1 \times 2^5 + 0 \times 2^4 + 0 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 32 + 4 = 36_{10} \text{ (incorrect, recheck)} \]

"To determine the probability that the damsteen is placed on a shaded square of the chessboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of squares on the chessboard:**
   A standard chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, so the total number of squares is:
   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64
   \]

2. **Determine the number of shaded squares:**
   The problem states that the first number is determined by dividing by 4 and the remainder is 1, 2, or 3. This means the first number can be 1, 2, or 3 (since \(4k + r\) where \(r\) is 1, 2, or 3). Similarly, the second number is determined by dividing by 5 and the remainder is 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means the second number can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   
   Therefore, there are \(3 \times 4 = 12\) possible combinations of the two numbers. Each combination corresponds to a unique square on the chessboard. Since the chessboard has 64 squares in total, the number of shaded squares is 12.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the damsteen is placed on a shaded square is the number of shaded squares divided by the total number of squares:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of specific angles, which gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[

- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane,
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{\text{C}}\).","[C, '\\text{C}']",\text{(C)},[],True
"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by determining the roots of \( g(x) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we have:

\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = 0 \]

This implies that \( x + 5 \) must be a root of \( f(x) \). Let the roots of \( f(x) \) be \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). Then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, \) and \( r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 \]

Next, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by:

\[ -\frac{a_2}{a_3} \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are \( a_3 = 1 \), \( a_2 = -49 \), \( a_1 = 623 \), and \( a_0 = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Substituting this back into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:

\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34 \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), we have \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, the identity simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\), so:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We also have the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle with angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C = 90^\circ\):

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \cot^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \cot^2 (90^\circ - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\) and \(B = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 9\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 9.
\]

Therefore, the original expression becomes:

\[

"To determine the number of sides \( n \) of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles minus one interior angle is \( 1070^\circ \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Recall the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon:**
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum of the interior angles and \( n \) is the number of sides.

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles minus one interior angle is \( 1070^\circ \). Let \( \theta \) be the measure of the interior angle that is subtracted. Then:
   \[
   S - \theta = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Substitute the formula for \( S \) into the equation:**
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \theta = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Solve for \( \theta \):**
   \[
   \theta = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

5. **Determine the range of possible values for \( \theta \):**
   Since \( \theta \) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Set up the inequality:**
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

7. **Solve the inequality step by step:**

   - First, solve \( 0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ \):
     \[
     1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
     \]
     Divide both sides by 180:
     \[
     \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     5.9444 < n-2
     \]
     Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     7.9444 < n
     \]
     Since \( n \) must be an integer:
     \[
     n \geq 8
     \]

   - Next, solve \( (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ \):
     \[
     (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
     \]
     Divide both sides by 180:
     \[
     n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     n-2 < 6.9444
     \]
     Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     n < 8.9444
     \]
     Since \( n \) must be an integer:
     \[
     n \leq 8

8. **Combine the results:**
   From both inequalities, we have:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8

"To find the unique one-digit integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by expressing the condition mathematically. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Here, we are given that \( x = t+2 \), so we can write:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( y^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( y \) from 1 to 11 (since \( y^2 \equiv (23-y)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.

From the above, we see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( t \) must be a one-digit integer, we have \( t = 4 \). To verify, we check if \( t+2 = 6 \) is the inverse of \( t = 4 \) modulo 23:

\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( SA \) is:

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.

"To find the average price of Juan's seëls in the 1970s, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of seëls from each country in the 1970s:**
   - Brazil: 12 seëls
   - Frankryk: 12 seëls
   - Peru: 6 seëls
   - Spain: 13 seëls

2. **Determine the price per seël for each country:**
   - Brazil: 6 sent per seël
   - Frankryk: 6 sent per seël
   - Peru: 4 sent per seël
   - Spain: 5 sent per seël

3. **Calculate the total cost for seëls from each country in the 1970s:**
   - Brazil: \( 12 \text{ seëls} \times 6 \text{ sent per seël} = 72 \text{ sent} \)
   - Frankryk: \( 12 \text{ seëls} \times 6 \text{ sent per seël} = 72 \text{ sent} \)
   - Peru: \( 6 \text{ seëls} \times 4 \text{ sent per seël} = 24 \text{ sent} \)
   - Spain: \( 13 \text{ seëls} \times 5 \text{ sent per seël} = 65 \text{ sent} \)

4. **Sum the total costs for all seëls in the 1970s:**
   \[
   72 \text{ sent} + 72 \text{ sent} + 24 \text{ sent} + 65 \text{ sent} = 233 \text{ sent}

5. **Calculate the total number of seëls in the 1970s:**
   \[
   12 \text{ seëls} + 12 \text{ seëls} + 6 \text{ seëls} + 13 \text{ seëls} = 43 \text{ seëls}

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezium with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezium \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with base \(CD = c\) and height \(AC = d\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

We need to find the relationship between \(d\) and \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\), we can express the area of \(\triangle ABC\) as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed in terms of the area of \(\triangle ABC\) and the area of trapezium \(ABCD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = [ABCD] - [\triangle ABC] = 42 - \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are in the ratio of their bases \(BC\) and \(AD\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{b}{a}
\]

Let \([\triangle ACD] = x\). Then:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{a} \times x
\]

Substituting this into the equation for the area of trapezium \(ABCD\):
\[
\frac{b}{a} \times x + x = 42
\]
\[
x \left( \frac{b}{a} + 1 \right) = 42
\]
\[
x \left( \frac{b + a}{a} \right) = 42
\]
\[
x = 42 \times \frac{a}{a + b}
\]

We already know that \(a + b = \frac{84}{h}\). Substituting this into the equation for \(x\):
\[
x = 42 \times \frac{a}{\frac{84}{h}} = 42 \times \frac{a \times h}{84} = \frac{42 \times a \times h}{84} = \frac{a \times h}{2}
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is also:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

From the right triangle \(\triangle ACD\), we have:
\[
d = h
\]

Thus:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]

Since \(d = h\), we equate the two expressions for \(\frac{a \times h}{2}\):
\[
\frac{a \times h}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]
\[
a = c
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{84}{2} = \frac{84}{4} = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}}
   \]
   Simplify inside the square roots:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{19} \cdot \frac{19}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( \frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right) \) to the fractions \( \frac{7}{30} \) and \( \frac{10}{21} \).

First, identify the values of \( m \), \( n \), \( p \), and \( q \) from the given fractions:
- \( m = 7 \)
- \( n = 30 \)
- \( p = 10 \)
- \( q = 21 \)

Next, substitute these values into the operation formula:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Now, perform the multiplication step by step:
1. Multiply \( m \) and \( p \):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

2. Multiply the result by \( \frac{q}{n} \):
\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30}
\]

To simplify \( 70 \times \frac{21}{30} \), we can first simplify the fraction \( \frac{21}{30} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 21 and 30 is 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, multiply \( 70 \) by \( \frac{7}{10} \):
\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 70 \times 0.7 = 49

Thus, the simplified value of \( \frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} \) is:

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), or any cyclic permutation of these orders.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: As mentioned, for \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must appear in one of the two orders \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations). There are 2 such orders. Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that segment \(AB\) and segment \(CD\) mekaar sny is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the shaded region. The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
According to the problem, the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. The area of the segment of the smaller circle is the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points where the circles intersect. Similarly, the area of the segment of the larger circle is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points where the circles intersect.

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points where the circles intersect is the same for both circles. The distance between the centers of the circles is 1 (the radius of the smaller circle), and the radius of the larger circle is 2. Using the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ADC\), we have:
\[
1^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times \cos \theta
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
1 = 4 + 4 - 8 \cos \theta
\]
\[
1 = 8 - 8 \cos \theta
\]
\[
8 \cos \theta = 7
\]
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{7}{8}
\]
The area of the triangle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we find:
\[
\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{49}{64} = \frac{15}{64}
\]
\[
\sin \theta = \sqrt{\frac{15}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{8}
\]
The area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} - 2 \sin \theta = \frac{\theta}{2} - 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{15}}{8} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}
\]
The area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
2\theta - 2 \sin \theta = 2\theta - 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{15}}{8} = 2\theta - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}
\]
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} + 2\theta - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = \frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}
\]
We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the denominators, we get:
\[
5\theta - \sqrt{15} = \frac{10\pi}{3}
\]
Solving for \(\theta\), we get:
\[
5\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3} + \sqrt{15}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{15}\) is not a multiple of \(\pi\), it must be that the term \(\sqrt{15}\) is zero in the context of the problem.

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of the volume of the tank to the volume of the beaker.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical beaker:
\[ \text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[

\[ 20 \text{ feet per minute} \times 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 240 \text{ inches per minute} \]

Next, we know that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds. Therefore, the speed in inches per second is:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from an 8 Republikeine and 6 Demokrate such that at least one member from each party is included, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a subcommittee consisting entirely of Republikeine or entirely of Demokrate).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 people (8 Republikeine and 6 Demokrate). This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is:

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists entirely of Republikeine. This is the number of ways to choose 5 members from the 8 Republikeine:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56
\]

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists entirely of Demokrate. This is the number of ways to choose 5 members from the 6 Demokrate:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a subcommittee consisting entirely of Republikeine or entirely of Demokrate) is the sum of the two cases above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement:

\[
2002 - 62 = 1940

Thus, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that ten minste one member of each party is:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[

Now, we multiply these two results together:

\[
(513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

Next, we are given that the product of these three integers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product divided by the average is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24
\]

We recognize that \((n-1) \cdot (n+1)\) is a difference of squares:
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:
\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]

Since we are looking for positive integers, we take \( n = 5 \).

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Thus, the expression becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is given by:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the height, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

In triangle \(BDC\), we can use the Law of Cosines:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC).
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), \(BD = CD\). Let \(BD = CD = x\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
BC^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cos(3\theta) = 2x^2(1 - \cos(3\theta)).
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = 2x^2(1 - (4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta))) = 2x^2(4\cos(\theta) - 4\cos^3(\theta)) = 8x^2\cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)) = 8x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta).
\]
In triangle \(ABD\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 = 10^2 + x^2 = 100 + x^2.
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), \(AC^2 = 100 + x^2\). In triangle \(AMC\), we can also use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC^2 = AM^2 + MC^2 = 11^2 + MC^2 = 121 + MC^2.
\]
Since \(MC = \frac{BC}{2}\), we have \(MC^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{BC^2}{4}\). Substituting \(BC^2 = 8x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)\) into the equation, we get:
\[
AC^2 = 121 + \frac{8x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)}{4} = 121 + 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta).
\]
Since \(AC^2 = 100 + x^2\), we can set the two expressions for \(AC^2\) equal to each other:
\[
100 + x^2 = 121 + 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2x^2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta) = 21 \implies x^2(1 - 2\cos(\theta)\sin^2(\theta)) = 21.
\]
Using the double angle identity for sine, \(\sin^2(\theta) = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}\), we substitute it into the equation:
\[
x^2\left(1 - 2\cos(\theta) \cdot \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}\right) = 21 \implies x^2\left(1 - \cos(\theta) + \cos(\theta)\cos(2\theta)\right) = 21.
\]
Using the double angle identity for cosine again, \(\cos(2\theta) = 2\cos^2(\theta) - 1\), we substitute it into the equation:
\[
x^2\left(1 - \cos(\theta) + \cos(\theta)(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1)\right) = 21 \implies x^2\left(1 - \cos(\theta) + 2\cos^3(\theta) - \cos(\theta)\right) = 21 \implies x^2\left(1 - 2\cos(\theta) + 2\cos^3(\theta)\right) = 21.
\]
Factoring out \(2\cos(\theta)\) from the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
x^2 \cdot 2\cos(\theta)(\cos^2(\theta) - \cos(\theta) + \frac{1}{2}) = 21.
\]
Since \(\cos^2(\theta) - \cos(\theta) + \frac{1}{2} = \left(\cos(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{4}\), we see that the expression inside the parentheses is always positive. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\) satisfies the equation. Substituting \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
x^2 \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) = 21 \implies x^2 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 21 \implies x^2 = 84 \implies x = \sqrt{84} = 2\sqrt{21}.
\]
Now, we can find \(BC\):
\[
BC = 2x = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{21} = 4\sqrt{21}.

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2\sqrt{100 + x^2} + 4\sqrt{21} = 2\sqrt{100 + 84} + 4\sqrt{21} = 2\sqrt{184} + 4\sqrt{21} = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{46} + 4\sqrt{21} = 4\sqrt{46} + 4\sqrt{21} = 4(\sqrt{46} + \sqrt{21}).

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187

To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factor the quadratic equation as follows:
\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, -7) \), \( (-7, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \). However, since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only need to test the interval \( [0, 3) \).

For \(0 \leq y < 3\), we can choose a test point, say \(y = 1\):
\[ (1)^2 + 4(1) - 21 = 1 + 4 - 21 = -16 \]
Since \(-16 < 0\), the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is true for \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Therefore, we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[

or

Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which grade has the number of male busryers that is closest to 135% of the number of female busryers, we need to calculate 135% of the percentage of female busryers for each grade and then compare it to the percentage of male busryers for that grade.

First, let's calculate 135% of the percentage of female busryers for each grade:

1. For the 9th grade:
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 39.4\% = 1.35 \times 39.4 = 55.71\%
   \]
   The percentage of male busryers in the 9th grade is 41.1%. The difference between 55.71% and 41.1% is:
   \[
   55.71\% - 41.1\% = 14.61\%
   \]

2. For the 10th grade:
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 33.1\% = 1.35 \times 33.1 = 44.685\%
   \]
   The percentage of male busryers in the 10th grade is 34.4%. The difference between 44.685% and 34.4% is:
   \[
   44.685\% - 34.4\% = 10.285\%
   \]

3. For the 11th grade:
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 13.8\% = 1.35 \times 13.8 = 18.63\%
   \]
   The percentage of male busryers in the 11th grade is 20.6%. The difference between 18.63% and 20.6% is:
   \[
   20.6\% - 18.63\% = 1.97\%
   \]

4. For the 12th grade:
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 8.6\% = 1.35 \times 8.6 = 11.55\%
   \]
   The percentage of male busryers in the 12th grade is 11.6%. The difference between 11.55% and 11.6% is:
   \[
   11.6\% - 11.55\% = 0.05\%
   \]

The smallest difference is 0.05%, which corresponds to the 12th grade. Therefore, the grade with the number of male busryers that is closest to 135% of the number of female busryers is the 12th grade.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Combining the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, we get:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.

"To determine the greatest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides of the field and two half-circular regions. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangular field by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two half-circular regions each have a radius equal to half the width of the field, which is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{W}{2} \) is given by:
\[
2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = \pi W
\]
Since there are two half-circular regions, the total length of the curved parts of the track is:
\[
2 \times \frac{\pi W}{2} = \pi W
\]

The total length of the straight parts of the track is:
\[
2L
\]

The sum of the lengths of the straight and curved parts gives us the total length of the track:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) to find the area of the field. Solving for \( L \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting \( L \) from the equation above:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \):
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)
\]
\[
L = 200 - 100
\]
\[
L = 100
\]

Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Therefore, the greatest possible area of the field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, for \(\angle R\), we have:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides (since side lengths are positive), we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of \(\angle T\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum value of \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):

\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]

The coordinates of the vertices are:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

We are given the distances from \( P \) to these vertices:
- \( PA = 3 \)
- \( PB = 7 \)
- \( PC = 8 \)
- \( PD = 9 \)
- \( PE = 11 \)

We need to find the distance \( PF \).

First, we use the distance formula to express the given distances in terms of \( x, y, \) and \( z \):

\[
PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7

\[

\[
PD = \sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
\[
PE = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11

\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40

\[
x = 10

\[

\[

\[
y^2 - 2y - 35 = 0

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[

\[

\]
\[
y = \frac{2 \pm 12}{2}
\]
\[
y = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -5

Next, we subtract the first equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 81 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 72

\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 20 = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y - 52 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
y = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 208}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{212}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{53}}{2}
\]
\[
y = -1 \pm \sqrt{53}
\]

Since \( y = 7 \) or \( y = -5 \) must satisfy both equations, we find that \( y = 7 \) is the only consistent solution.

Finally, we substitute \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 7 \) into the fifth equation to find \( z \):

"To solve the problem, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

According to the problem, Jen applies the same force to her ball as Jack does to his ball. Let's denote the force applied by both Jen and Jack as \( F \). Let the mass of Jen's ball be \( m_J = 200 \) g and the mass of Jack's ball be \( m_K = 150 \) g. Let the acceleration of Jen's ball be \( a_J \) and the acceleration of Jack's ball be \( a_K \).

Using Newton's second law for Jen's ball, we have:

\[ F = m_J \cdot a_J \]

Substituting the value of \( m_J \):

\[ F = 200 \cdot a_J \]

Using Newton's second law for Jack's ball, we have:

\[ F = m_K \cdot a_K \]

Substituting the value of \( m_K \):

\[ F = 150 \cdot a_K \]

Since the force \( F \) is the same for both balls, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 \cdot a_J = 150 \cdot a_K \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to the acceleration of Jack's ball, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_K} \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{150}{200} \]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's ball is:

"To determine how many of the same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) contains the digits: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- \(1165_8\) contains the digits: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

**Step 4: Count the number of common digits.**

There are 3 common digits: \(1, 5, 6\).

Thus, the number of same digits found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the number of handshakes that occur, we need to consider the interactions between the hekse and the towenaars. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Handshakes between the hekse and the towenaars:**
   - The hekse shakes hands with each of the 10 towenaars.
   - Therefore, the number of handshakes between the hekse and the towenaars is \(10\).

2. **Handshakes between the towenaars:**
   - Each towenaar shakes hands with every other towenaar exactly once.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 towenaars out of 10 to shake hands is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{2} \).
   - The combination formula \( \binom{n}{r} \) is calculated as \( \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \).
   - For \( \binom{10}{2} \), we have \( \frac{10!}{2!8!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45 \).
   - Therefore, the number of handshakes between the towenaars is \(45\).

3. **Total number of handshakes:**
   - The total number of handshakes is the sum of the handshakes between the hekse and the towenaars and the handshakes between the towenaars.
   - This is \(10 + 45 = 55\).

Thus, the total number of handshakes that have place in the menger is \(\boxed{55}\).","[55, '55']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Now, substitute \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(x_1\), and \(y_1\) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0 = -4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2, t = 1 + i, t = 1 - i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

Next, let's find the difference in the number of potloes:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one potloo by dividing the difference in cost by the difference in the number of potloes:
\[ \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29 \]

Since the cost is given in dollars, we need to convert it to sent. There are 100 sent in a dollar, so:

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((-a, b)\), \(B\) at \((a, b)\), \(C\) at \((a, -b)\), and \(D\) at \((-a, -b)\). The condition that a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed using the Euclidean distance formula. Specifically, a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(A\) if:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + y^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + y^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
x^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 \implies -a^2 < 2ax \implies x > -\frac{a}{2}
\]

Similarly, a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(B\) if:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + y^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + y^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
x^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 \implies 2ax < a^2 \implies x < \frac{a}{2}
\]

A point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(C\) if:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax < a^2 + 2by + b^2
\]

A point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(D\) if:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -a^2 - b^2 < 2ax + 2by
\]

Combining these inequalities, we see that the region where a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the square with vertices at \(\left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\), and \(\left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\).

\[

\]

The area of the original rectangle is:

\[
2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:

First, we perform the division:

The quotient is 9, which means that 6 fits into 54 exactly 9 times. To find the remainder, we multiply the quotient by the divisor and subtract the result from the original number:
\[54 - (6 \times 9) = 54 - 54 = 0\]

- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide by the number of students. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 80.
2. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 90.
3. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 100.
4. Add up all the scores to get the total sum.
5. Divide the total sum by the number of students to get the average.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total score for the students who scored 80 is:
   \[
   20 \times 80 = 1600
   \]

2. The total score for the students who scored 90 is:
   \[
   8 \times 90 = 720
   \]

3. The total score for the students who scored 100 is:
   \[
   2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

4. Add up all the scores to get the total sum:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

5. Divide the total sum by the number of students to get the average:
   \[
   \frac{2520}{30} = 84

Therefore, the class average score is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the numbers in the third row, the columns, and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the numbers in the third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Martha loops than Jim, we need to calculate the total distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim loops around the diagonal of the rectangular field. The diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2}
\]
Given the length is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{250000}
\]
\[
d = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha loops around the perimeter of the rectangular field. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
P = 2 \times (400 + 300)
\]
\[
P = 2 \times 700
\]
\[
P = 1400 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Martha travels 1400 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by Martha and Jim:
\[
\text{Difference} = 1400 - 500
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 900 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Martha loops \(\boxed{900}\) feet more than Jim.","[900, '900']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we get:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled by visiting each of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once, we need to consider all possible permutations of the points and calculate the total distance for each permutation. The point \(D\) is the starting point, so we will calculate the distance for each permutation of the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) after \(D\).

Let's list all the permutations of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\):
1. \(D \to A \to B \to C\)
2. \(D \to A \to C \to B\)
3. \(D \to B \to A \to C\)
4. \(D \to B \to C \to A\)
5. \(D \to C \to A \to B\)
6. \(D \to C \to B \to A\)

Now, we calculate the total distance for each permutation:
1. For \(D \to A \to B \to C\):
   \[
   DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
2. For \(D \to A \to C \to B\):
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
3. For \(D \to B \to A \to C\):
   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]
4. For \(D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
5. For \(D \to C \to A \to B\):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
   \]
6. For \(D \to C \to B \to A\):
   \[
   DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

From the calculations, we see that the shortest distance is 14, which corresponds to the permutation \(D \to B \to C \to A\).
