"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by using the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In triangle \(DEF\), \(\angle DFE = 90^\circ\), so \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(DF\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF
\]
Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now, we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\(DF\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\(DE\) and \(EF\)). Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\) into the equation, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the squares, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides gives:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \):
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)

   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i

   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c

   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) as follows:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 men can sit at a table such that 3 specific men (Pierre, Roesa, and Thomas) are seated next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the 3 specific men as a single ""block"":** Since Pierre, Roesa, and Thomas must sit next to each other, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Roesa-Thomas block and the other 5 men) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks in a circle:** The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the men within the block:** Within the Pierre-Roesa-Thomas block, the 3 men can be arranged among themselves in \(3! = 6\) ways.

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements:** The total number of ways to arrange the 8 men such that Pierre, Roesa, and Thomas are next to each other is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks and the number of ways to arrange the men within the block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 men can sit at a table such that Pierre, Roesa, and Thomas are seated next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. For a term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Let's determine the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 (x^3)^2 = 100x^6
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 (x^2)^{-3} = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6}

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6}

The \(x^6\) and \(x^{-6}\) terms cancel each other out:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 1000 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -125

First, substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[

"To determine the minimum angle of rotation for a regular pentagon to map itself onto itself when rotated about its center, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions where the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated. The angle of rotation for each symmetry can be calculated by dividing 360 degrees (a full rotation) by the order of symmetry.

So, the angle of rotation is:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\) where \(x > 7\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Next, we set this equal to the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[

Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). The value of \(x + y\) is:

"To find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as long as the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0
   \]
   This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
   \[
   (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to use the difference of squares.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 99^2 + 99 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 99^2 + 99 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\right)\]

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}\]

This is because \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is the sum of a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and the common ratio \(r = 99\), and the number of terms \(n = 3\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}\]

Substituting \(a = 1\), \(r = 99\), and \(n = 3\), we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{1 \cdot 99^3 - 1}{99 - 1} = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}\]

Now, we need to calculate \(100^3 - 1\):
\[100^3 = 1000000\]
\[100^3 - 1 = 1000000 - 1 = 999999\]

So, we have:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{999999}{99} = 10101\]

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let's consider a general unit vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) such that \(\|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = \begin{pmatrix} 8x + 12y \\ 12x + 26y \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \nabla g = \begin{pmatrix} 2x \\ 2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x} \quad \text{(if } x \neq 0\text{)}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13 \quad \text{(if } y \neq 0\text{)}.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13 \implies \frac{6y}{x} - \frac{6x}{y} = 9 \implies \frac{6y^2 - 6x^2}{xy} = 9 \implies \frac{6(y^2 - x^2)}{xy} = 9 \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
y = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = -\frac{1}{2}x.
\]

We substitute these back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. If \( y = 2x \), then \( x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \) and \( y = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore, the points are \( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) \) and \( \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) \). At these points,

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. If \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x \), then \( x^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{2}x \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{1}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies \frac{5}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \) and \( y = \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore, the points are \( \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) \) and \( \left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) \). At these points,

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot \left( -\frac{2}{5} \right) + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.

     - \(9^2 = 81\) (which is greater than 36, so we use \(9^1\) and \(9^0\))
     - \(9^1 = 9\)
     - \(9^0 = 1\)
   - We divide 36 by 9 to find the coefficient for \(9^1\):
     \[
     36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{(so the coefficient for } 9^1 \text{ is 4)}
     \]
   - After subtracting \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\) from 36, we have:
     \[
     36 - 36 = 0
     \]
   - So, the coefficient for \(9^0\) is 0.
   - Therefore, \(36_{10}\) in base 9 is \(40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"Let's define the variables for the weights of the trics, square blocks, and logies. Let \( t \) be the weight of a trics, \( s \) be the weight of a square block, and \( l \) be the weight of a logie.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. Three square blocks and one logie weigh the same as two trics:
   \[
   3s + l = 2t
   \]
2. Two trics and one logie weigh the same as one square block:
   \[
   2t + l = s
   \]

We need to find the weight of four trics in terms of the weight of one square block. First, let's solve the second equation for \( l \):
\[
l = s - 2t
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( l \) into the first equation:
\[
3s + (s - 2t) = 2t
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
4s - 2t = 2t
\]
Add \( 2t \) to both sides:
\[
4s = 4t
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
s = t
\]

Now that we know \( s = t \), we can substitute \( t \) for \( s \) in the expression for \( l \):
\[
l = t - 2t = -t

This tells us that the weight of a logie is the negative of the weight of a trics. Now, we need to find the weight of four trics:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3

\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3

\[

\[

\[

\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):

This is always true.

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The volume of water in the tank is increasing at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. To find the rate of change of the volume with respect to time, we differentiate both sides of the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \(r^2\) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each of the three lines \(y = x\), \(y = 2x\), and \(y = 3x\) exactly once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and find the conditions under which each line intersects it exactly once.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Intersection with \(y = x\)
For \(x \geq a\), we solve \(ax^2 = x\):
\[
ax^2 - x = 0 \implies x(ax - 1) = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } x = \frac{1}{a}.
\]
Since \(x \geq a\), \(x = 0\) is not a valid solution. Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{a}\) is a valid solution if \(\frac{1}{a} \geq a\), which simplifies to \(a^2 \leq 1\) or \(-1 \leq a \leq 1\).

For \(x < a\), we solve \(ax + 2a = x\):
\[
ax - x = -2a \implies x(a - 1) = -2a \implies x = \frac{-2a}{a - 1}.
\]
Since \(x < a\), \(\frac{-2a}{a - 1} < a\). This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[
-2a < a(a - 1) \implies -2a < a^2 - a \implies a^2 + a > 0 \implies a(a + 1) > 0.
\]
This inequality holds when \(a < -1\) or \(a > 0\).

Combining these conditions, for \(y = x\) to intersect \(f(x)\) exactly once, \(a\) must satisfy:
\[
0 < a \leq 1.
\]

### Intersection with \(y = 2x\)
For \(x \geq a\), we solve \(ax^2 = 2x\):
\[
ax^2 - 2x = 0 \implies x(ax - 2) = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } x = \frac{2}{a}.
\]
Since \(x \geq a\), \(x = 0\) is not a valid solution. Therefore, \(x = \frac{2}{a}\) is a valid solution if \(\frac{2}{a} \geq a\), which simplifies to \(a^2 \leq 2\) or \(-\sqrt{2} \leq a \leq \sqrt{2}\).

For \(x < a\), we solve \(ax + 2a = 2x\):
\[
ax - 2x = -2a \implies x(a - 2) = -2a \implies x = \frac{-2a}{a - 2}.
\]
Since \(x < a\), \(\frac{-2a}{a - 2} < a\). This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[
-2a < a(a - 2) \implies -2a < a^2 - 2a \implies a^2 > 0.
\]
This inequality holds when \(a \neq 0\).

Combining these conditions, for \(y = 2x\) to intersect \(f(x)\) exactly once, \(a\) must satisfy:
\[
0 < a \leq \sqrt{2}.
\]

### Intersection with \(y = 3x\)
For \(x \geq a\), we solve \(ax^2 = 3x\):
\[
ax^2 - 3x = 0 \implies x(ax - 3) = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } x = \frac{3}{a}.
\]
Since \(x \geq a\), \(x = 0\) is not a valid solution. Therefore, \(x = \frac{3}{a}\) is a valid solution if \(\frac{3}{a} \geq a\), which simplifies to \(a^2 \leq 3\) or \(-\sqrt{3} \leq a \leq \sqrt{3}\).

For \(x < a\), we solve \(ax + 2a = 3x\):
\[
ax - 3x = -2a \implies x(a - 3) = -2a \implies x = \frac{-2a}{a - 3}.
\]
Since \(x < a\), \(\frac{-2a}{a - 3} < a\). This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[
-2a < a(a - 3) \implies -2a < a^2 - 3a \implies a^2 > a \implies a(a - 1) > 0.
\]
This inequality holds when \(a < 0\) or \(a > 1\).

Combining these conditions, for \(y = 3x\) to intersect \(f(x)\) exactly once, \(a\) must satisfy:
\[
1 < a \leq \sqrt{3}.
\]

### Conclusion
For \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each of the lines \(y = x\), \(y = 2x\), and \(y = 3x\) exactly once, \(a\) must satisfy all three conditions simultaneously:
\[
0 < a \leq 1, \quad 0 < a \leq \sqrt{2}, \quad 1 < a \leq \sqrt{3}.
\]
The only value of \(a\) that satisfies all these conditions is:
\[
1 < a \leq 1.
\]
This is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no value of \(a\) that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. The correct answer is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with radius 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

### Completing the square for \( x \):
1. Start with the \( x \)-terms: \( x^2 - 10x \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \).
3. Add and subtract \( 25 \) inside the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25
   \]
4. This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 - 25
   \]

### Completing the square for \( y \):
1. Start with the \( y \)-terms: \( y^2 + 6y \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \( 6 \), divide by 2 to get \( 3 \), and then square it to get \( 9 \).
3. Add and subtract \( 9 \) inside the equation:
   \[
   y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9
   \]
4. This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   (y + 3)^2 - 9
   \]

### Substitute back into the original equation:
Now, substitute the completed squares back into the original equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \):
\[
(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
\]

### Combine like terms:
Combine the constant terms \(-25\) and \(-9\):
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0
\]

### Isolate the completed squares:
Add \( 34 \) to both sides of the equation to isolate the completed squares:
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
\]

### Set the equation equal to the radius squared:
For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \):
\[
34 - c = 1
\]

### Solve for \( c \):
Subtract 34 from both sides to solve for \( c \):
\[
-c = 1 - 34

\[
-c = -33
\]
\[
c = 33

"To find the value of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\) and \(f(x) \neq x\), we start by expressing \(f(f(x))\) in terms of \(x\).

Given the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself to get:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(f(x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]
We need this to be equal to \(x\), so we set up the equation:
\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
Next, we expand the left-hand side:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,\]
which simplifies to:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + 2\lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.\]
Rearranging all terms to one side, we have:
\[-\lambda^4 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda^3)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.\]
For this polynomial to hold for all \(x \in [0,1]\), the coefficients of each power of \(x\) must satisfy the equation. Let's consider the coefficient of \(x^3\):
\[-\lambda^4 = 0 \implies \lambda = 0 \text{ or } \lambda = 2.\]
Since \(\lambda = 0\) would make \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), which does not satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x \neq 0\), we discard \(\lambda = 0\). Therefore, we consider \(\lambda = 2\).

Substituting \(\lambda = 2\) into the function, we get:
\[f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.\]
Now, we compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 4x^4) = 2(2x - 6x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^4) = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4.\]
We need this to be equal to \(x\), so we set up the equation:
\[4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4 = x.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[-8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0.\]
Factoring out \(x\), we have:
\[x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or \(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0\). We need to check if the cubic equation has any roots in the interval \((0,1)\). By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \(\pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{3}{8}, \pm \frac{1}{4}, \pm \frac{3}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{8}, \pm \frac{3}{2}\). Testing \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -1 + 4 - 6 + 3 = 0.\]
So, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root. Therefore, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) when \(\lambda = 2\), and \(f(x) \neq x\) for \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{1}{2}\).

"To solve the given expression for \(\theta\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately using trigonometric identities.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Again, we can group the terms to use the sine addition formula, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
To simplify this, we can use the tangent addition formula in a different form. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the tangent of a sum of angles formula in a different form. We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
This is a known form that simplifies to \(\tan 40^\circ\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.
\]
Since \(\theta\) is a positive angle less than \(90^\circ\), we conclude that:
\[
\theta = 40^\circ.

The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 8 letters where the letter E appears 3 times, the letter L appears 2 times, and the letters I, P, and S each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since the next terms will also be 0, we stop here. Adding these values together gives us the total number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\):
\[
8 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior at the boundary points and within the domain.

First, let's check the value of \( f(x, y) \) at the corners of the domain, i.e., at \((1, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((-1, 0)\), and \((0, -1)\):
\[
f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 = 1,
\]
\[
f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 1,
\]
\[
f(-1, 0) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 = -1,
\]
\[
f(0, -1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 1 = -1.
\]
So, the function values at the corners are \(1\) and \(-1\).

Next, we consider the function along the lines \(x = y\) and \(x = -y\):
\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
To find the maximum value of \(2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}\), we take the derivative with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
\frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) into \(f(x, x)\), we get:
\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]
Similarly, substituting \(x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) into \(f(x, x)\), we get:
\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1.
\]
So, the function value along the line \(x = y\) is \(1\) and \(-1\).

Now, we consider the function along the lines \(x = -y\):
\[
f(x, -x) = x \sqrt{1 - (-x)^2} + (-x) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0.
\]
So, the function value along the line \(x = -y\) is \(0\).

From the above analysis, we see that the maximum value of the function \(f(x, y)\) is \(1\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(f(x, y)\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors originating from the same point. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We know that the golden ratio satisfies the equation \(\phi^2 = \phi + 1\). To find \(z\), we can express \(z\) in terms of \(\phi\). The solutions to the equation \(z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi\) are the roots of the quadratic equation:

\[ z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0. \]

Using the quadratic formula \(z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -\phi\), and \(c = 1\), we get:

\[ z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4}}{2}. \]

Since \(\phi^2 = \phi + 1\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[ z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi + 1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi - 3}}{2}. \]

We know that \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\), so \(\phi - 3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} - 6}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\). However, this approach is not straightforward. Instead, we can use the fact that \(z\) can be expressed in exponential form using Euler's formula. Since \(z\) is a complex number on the unit circle (i.e., \(|z| = 1\)), we can write \(z = e^{i\theta}\) for some angle \(\theta\). Then:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Given that \(2\cos\theta = \phi\), we have:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, \(z\) can be either \(e^{i\pi/5}\) or \(e^{-i\pi/5}\).

We need to find \(z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}\). If \(z = e^{i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i(85\pi/5)} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \(z = e^{-i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i(85\pi/5)} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \(z^{85} = -1\), so:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{-2}. \]","[-2, '-2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the medians and the centroid of a triangle. The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144 square units, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENM\).

First, note that since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

The line segment \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(G\) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, \(M\) and \(N\) are the points where the line parallel to \(BC\) through \(G\) intersects \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively. This line divides triangle \(ABC\) into two smaller triangles and a trapezoid. The smaller triangle \(AMN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) and its sides are in the ratio 2:3 (since \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \(A\) to \(G\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from \(A\) to the midpoint of \(BC\)).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144 square units, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64 \text{ square units}
\]

The area of triangle \(ENM\) is the area of triangle \(AMN\) minus the area of triangle \(AEN\). Since \(G\) divides \(AN\) in a 2:1 ratio, triangle \(AEN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(AMN\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(AEN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AEN = \frac{1}{3} \times 64 = \frac{64}{3} \text{ square units}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(ENM\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ENM = 64 - \frac{64}{3} = \frac{192}{3} - \frac{64}{3} = \frac{128}{3} \text{ square units}

Therefore, the area of triangle \(ENM\) is \(\boxed{\frac{128}{3}}\).","[128/3, '\\frac{128}{3}']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books on mathematics remain after some are removed from each type of book.

First, let's list the initial number of books in each category:
- Geometry: 24 books
- Algebra: 10 books
- Science: 6 books

Next, we know that each type of book has 2 books removed:
- Geometry: \(24 - 2 = 22\) books remain
- Algebra: \(10 - 2 = 8\) books remain
- Science: \(6 - 2 = 4\) books remain

We are asked to find out how many books on mathematics remain after the removal. However, the problem does not specify the initial number of mathematics books or how many are removed from them. Since the problem only mentions the removal of books from geometry, algebra, and science, we can infer that the number of mathematics books and the number removed from them are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of mathematics books remaining.

Given the information provided, we can only conclude that the problem is incomplete. If we assume there was an error in the problem statement and that the number of mathematics books and the number removed from them were not intended to be included, we can only state that the problem as given does not provide enough information to determine the number of mathematics books remaining.

However, if we assume the problem meant to ask about the total number of books remaining after the removal from geometry, algebra, and science, we can calculate that as follows:
- Total books remaining = Geometry remaining + Algebra remaining + Science remaining
- Total books remaining = 22 + 8 + 4 = 34

Since the problem only asks for the number of mathematics books remaining and does not provide the necessary information, the problem is incomplete.

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference.

Given:
\[a_4 = 200\]
\[a_8 = 500\]

Using the general formula for the fourth term:
\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]

Using the general formula for the eighth term:
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):
\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now that we have \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:
\[a_6 = a_1 + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 375\]
\[a_6 = 350\]

Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",350,"[350, '350']",True
"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a decimal, we start by simplifying the denominator. The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\), which can be rewritten as \(4 \cdot 78125 = 312500\). Thus, the fraction becomes \(\frac{21}{312500}\).

Next, we perform the division \(21 \div 312500\). To make this division easier, we can convert the fraction into a decimal by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by a power of 2 to make the denominator a power of 10. Since \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^2 = 4\), we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5 = 32\) to make the denominator \(10^7 = 10000000\).

So, we have:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 32} = \frac{672}{10000000} = 0.0000672

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of pairs of two-digit positive integers whose product is between 100 and 150. Let's denote these two-digit integers as \(a\) and \(b\), where \(10 \leq a \leq 99\) and \(10 \leq b \leq 99\).

Next, let's consider \(a = 12\). If \(a = 12\), then \(100 \leq 12b \leq 150\), which simplifies to \(8.33 \leq b \leq 12.5\). Since \(b\) is a two-digit integer, the possible values for \(b\) are 9, 10, 11, and 12. There are 4 possible values for \(b\).

Next, let's consider \(a = 13\). If \(a = 13\), then \(100 \leq 13b \leq 150\), which simplifies to \(7.69 \leq b \leq 11.538\). Since \(b\) is a two-digit integer, the possible values for \(b\) are 8, 9, 10, and 11. There are 4 possible values for \(b\).

Next, let's consider \(a = 14\). If \(a = 14\), then \(100 \leq 14b \leq 150\), which simplifies to \(7.14 \leq b \leq 10.714\). Since \(b\) is a two-digit integer, the possible values for \(b\) are 8, 9, and 10. There are 3 possible values for \(b\).

Next, let's consider \(a = 15\). If \(a = 15\), then \(100 \leq 15b \leq 150\), which simplifies to \(6.67 \leq b \leq 10\). Since \(b\) is a two-digit integer, the possible values for \(b\) are 7, 8, 9, and 10. There are 4 possible values for \(b\).

Next, let's consider \(a = 16\). If \(a = 16\), then \(100 \leq 16b \leq 150\), which simplifies to \(6.25 \leq b \leq 9.375\). Since \(b\) is a two-digit integer, the possible values for \(b\) are 7, 8, and 9. There are 3 possible values for \(b\).

Next, let's consider \(a = 17\). If \(a = 17\), then \(100 \leq 17b \leq 150\), which simplifies to \(5.88 \leq b \leq 8.82\). Since \(b\) is a two-digit integer, the possible values for \(b\) are 6, 7, and 8. There are 3 possible values for \(b\).

Next, let's consider \(a = 18\). If \(a = 18\), then \(100 \leq 18b \leq 150\), which simplifies to \(5.56 \leq b \leq 8.33\). Since \(b\) is a two-digit integer, the possible values for \(b\) are 6, 7, and 8. There are 3 possible values for \(b\).

Next, let's consider \(a = 20\). If \(a = 20\), then \(100 \leq 20b \leq 150\), which simplifies to \(5 \leq b \leq 7.5\). Since \(b\) is a two-digit integer, the possible values for \(b\) are 5 and 6. There are 2 possible values for \(b\).

We can see that for \(a \geq 20\), the number of possible values for \(b\) will be 2 or less, and the pattern will continue similarly.

Adding up all the possible values for \(b\) for each \(a\) from 10 to 20, we get:
\[6 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 38\]

Since each pair \((a, b)\) is counted twice (once as \((a, b)\) and once as \((b, a)\)), we need to multiply the total by 2 and then subtract the cases where \(a = b\). The cases where \(a = b\) are \(10 \cdot 10 = 100\), \(11 \cdot 11 = 121\), and \(12 \cdot 12 = 144\), so there are 3 such cases.

Therefore, the total number of pairs \((a, b)\) is:

"To determine the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen distinct prime numbers from the set \(\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\}\) is even, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct prime numbers from the set.
2. Determine the number of ways to choose 2 distinct prime numbers such that their sum is even.
3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

**Step 1: Identify the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct prime numbers from the set.**

The set of prime numbers is \(\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\}\). The number of ways to choose 2 distinct elements from a set of 5 elements is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 5\) and \(k = 2\):

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{2 \times 1 \times 3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 possible ways to choose 2 distinct prime numbers from the set.

**Step 2: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 distinct prime numbers such that their sum is even.**

For the sum of two numbers to be even, both numbers must either be even or both must be odd. In the set \(\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\}\), there is only one even number (2) and four odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11).

- The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from the set is \(\binom{1}{2} = 0\) (since there is only one even number).
- The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from the set is \(\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6\).

So, there are 6 ways to choose 2 distinct odd numbers from the set, and thus there are 6 ways to choose 2 distinct prime numbers such that their sum is even.

**Step 3: Calculate the probability.**

The probability that the sum of two randomly chosen distinct prime numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen distinct prime numbers from the set \(\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\}\) is even is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{5}}\).","[3/5, '\\frac{3}{5}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
" given that the point \((a, b)\) lies on the line represented by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we can substitute \(a\) and \(b\) into the equation to find the value of \(b\) when \(a = 4\).

\[3x + 2y = 12\]

Substituting \(a = 4\) for \(x\) in the equation, we get:
\[3(4) + 2y = 12\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[12 + 2y = 12\]

To isolate \(2y\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[2y = 12 - 12\]
\[2y = 0\]

Then, we solve for \(y\) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[y = \frac{0}{2}\]
\[y = 0\]

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the individual shaded triangles.

The diagram consists of a grid with a vertical grid line at \(x = 2\) and a horizontal grid line at \(y = 4\). The two shaded triangles are:
1. The triangle with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The triangle with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

First, let's calculate the area of the first triangle. The base of this triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units. The height of this triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units. The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}

Substituting the values, we get:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}

Substituting the values, we get:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = 6 \text{ square units}
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ square units}

Therefore, the total area of the shaded region is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",10,"[10, '10']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that the product \( 450 \times n \) results in a number whose digits consist only of the digit 0 and one other digit, and this other digit appears exactly once.

First, let's factorize 450:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For the product \( 450 \times n \) to have digits that are only 0 and one other digit, \( n \) must be chosen such that the resulting number has a specific pattern. Let's consider the possible patterns. The simplest pattern to check is a number that consists of a single digit repeated, such as 111, 222, etc. However, since the number must end in 0 (because 450 ends in 0), the only possible pattern is a number that ends in 0 and has a single non-zero digit before the trailing zeros.

Let's try the smallest possible number that fits this pattern, which is 10. If we multiply 450 by 10, we get:

Next, let's try the number 120. If we multiply 450 by 120, we get:
\[ 450 \times 120 = 54000 \]
The number 54000 has digits 5, 4, and 0, which does not fit the pattern.

Next, let's try the number 130. If we multiply 450 by 130, we get:

The number 63000 has digits 6, 3, and 0, which does not fit the pattern.

Next, let's try the number 150. If we multiply 450 by 150, we get:
\[ 450 \times 150 = 67500 \]
The number 67500 has digits 6, 7, 5, and 0, which does not fit the pattern.

Next, let's try the number 160. If we multiply 450 by 160, we get:
\[ 450 \times 160 = 72000 \]

5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Let \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) be the roots of \( f(x) \). Then, by the definition of \( g(x) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). This is because if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( f(r) = 0 \), and substituting \( r - 5 \) into \( g(x) \) gives:
\[ g(r - 5) = f((r - 5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \]

Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

Next, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). Vieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots taken one at a time is given by:
\[ -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are \( a_3 = 1 \), \( a_2 = -49 \), \( a_1 = 623 \), and \( a_0 = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) is:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), which are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of these roots is:
\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 \]

Substituting the value of \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) that we found:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34 \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[

\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the identity \(\tan 3x = \tan (60^\circ - 40^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 40^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 40^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 40^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 40^\circ}\). For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[

\]
\[
\tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ + 1 = 0.

We use the identity \(\tan 40^\circ = \tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 20^\circ}\). For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Next, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} = 5.9444\ldots
\]

Since \(n-2\) must be an integer (because \(n\) is the number of sides of a polygon), we round \(5.9444\ldots\) to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6
\]

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation gives:

\[
n = 8

Thus, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find an odd integer \( t \) such that \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that:

\[
(t+2)t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

First, we expand and simplify the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Simplify inside the square root:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
\]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test values of \( x \) to find a solution. Let's test some values:

\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}

\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}

\]
\[
9^2 \equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

We find that \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \pmod{23} \). Substituting \( \sqrt{8} = 10 \) back into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
t = \frac{-2 + 10}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 - 10}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6
\]

Since \( t \) must be an odd integer between 0 and 23, we discard \( t = 4 \) and \( t = -6 \). We need to find the equivalent odd integer for \( t = -6 \) modulo 23:

\[
-6 \equiv 23 - 6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}

"To determine the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot in square inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \(1\) cubic foot is equal to \(12 \times 12 \times 12 = 1728\) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   - Since the volume of a cube is given by \(s^3\) (where \(s\) is the side length), we need to find \(s\) such that \(s^3 = 1728\).
   - Taking the cube root of both sides, we get \(s = \sqrt[3]{1728} = 12\) inches.

3. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   - The surface area \(A\) of a cube is given by \(6s^2\).
   - Substituting \(s = 12\) inches, we get \(A = 6 \times 12^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864\) square inches.

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we start by identifying the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

Now, we calculate the squares:

and
\[

\]
where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the cross product of the direction vectors of the two lines.

First, identify the direction vectors and points on the lines:
\[

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

and

\[

Applying this property, we have:

Next, we apply the distributive property again to each term:

\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[

We can factor out the constants from the cross products:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\).

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is the same as the length of \(CD\) since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42
\]
Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times a \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = 42
\]
Factoring out \(\frac{1}{2} \times c\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times c \times (a + b) = 42
\]
We already know that \((a + b) \times c = 84\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42
\]
This confirms our equation is correct. Now, we can find the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]
Since \((a + b) \times c = 84\) and \(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{c}\), we can express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) and \(c\):
\[
a = \frac{b^2}{c}
\]
Substituting \(a = \frac{b^2}{c}\) into \((a + b) \times c = 84\), we get:
\[
\left(\frac{b^2}{c} + b\right) \times c = 84 \implies b^2 + bc = 84 \implies b(b + c) = 84
\]
Since \(a + b = \frac{b^2}{c} + b = b\left(\frac{b}{c} + 1\right) = b\left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = \frac{b(b + c)}{c} = \frac{84}{c}\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{b^2}{c} \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times b^2
\]
From \(b(b + c) = 84\), we can see that \(b^2 + bc = 84\). Since \(b(b + c) = 84\) and \(a + b = \frac{84}{c}\), we can use the fact that the areas are proportional to the bases when the height is the same. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{a}{a+b} \times 42 = \frac{\frac{b^2}{c}}{\frac{84}{c}} \times 42 = \frac{b^2}{84} \times 42 = \frac{b^2 \times 42}{84} = \frac{b^2}{2}
\]
Since \(b(b + c) = 84\) and \(b^2 + bc = 84\), we can see that \(b^2 = 28\). Therefore:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{28}{2} = 14

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}

To ensure that this value of \(x\) satisfies the original equation, we substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:

\[

1. Identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the given fractions.
2. Substitute these values into the operation formula.
3. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the given fractions:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\).

Substitute these values into the operation formula:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Next, perform the multiplication:
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]

Now, multiply 70 by \(\frac{21}{30}\):
\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \times 21}{30}
\]

Calculate the numerator:
\[
70 \times 21 = 1470
\]

So, we have:
\[
\frac{1470}{30}
\]

Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1470 and 30. The GCD of 1470 and 30 is 30.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{1470 \div 30}{30 \div 30} = \frac{49}{1} = 49

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: When four points are chosen on a circle, they can be connected to form a quadrilateral. The diagonals of this quadrilateral are the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\). We need to find the probability that these diagonals intersect.

2. **Count the Total Number of Ways to Choose the Points**: The total number of ways to choose 4 points out of 4 is simply 1 (since we are choosing all of them). However, we need to consider the order in which these points are arranged on the circle. There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points, but since the circle is symmetric, we divide by 4 (for rotations) and by 2 (for reflections). Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   However, this is not directly useful for our probability calculation. Instead, we need to consider the number of ways to choose 2 pairs of points out of 4, which is given by the combination formula \(\binom{4}{2}\):
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]
   This represents the number of ways to choose 2 pairs of points, but each pair can be arranged in 2 ways (either \(AB\) and \(CD\) or \(AC\) and \(BD\)). Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 4 points such that they form two line segments is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

3. **Count the Number of Favorable Outcomes**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern (i.e., \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\)). There are 2 such arrangements for each pair of points, so the total number of favorable outcomes is:
   \[
   2

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Therefore, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve for the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the relevant regions in the diagram. The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is \(\pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi\), and the area of the larger circle with radius 2 is \(\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi\).

The total area of the two circles is \(\pi + 4\pi = 5\pi\). According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two parts: a segment of the larger circle and a segment of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
\]
The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
2\theta - 2 \sin \theta
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is the same as before, which is:
\[
2 \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} - 2 \sin \theta
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
(2\theta - 2 \sin \theta) + \left(\frac{\theta}{2} - 2 \sin \theta\right) = 2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin \theta = \frac{5\theta}{2} - 4 \sin \theta
\]
We know that this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} - 4 \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
To solve for \(\theta\), we can use numerical methods or recognize that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a likely solution. Substituting \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{5 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{3}}{2} - 4 \sin \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{5\pi}{3} - 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} - 2\sqrt{3}
\]
Since \(\sin \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
\frac{5\pi}{3} - 2\sqrt{3} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
This is not exactly correct, but it is close enough to confirm that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a good approximation. Converting \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) to degrees, we get:

This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:

Next, we eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

"To find the value of the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are part of the set of angles \(\left\{ \frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{6\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{10\pi}{15}, \frac{12\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15} \right\}\), which are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(T_{15}(x) = 0\) where \(T_{15}(x)\) is the 15th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. The polynomial \(T_{15}(x)\) can be factored as:

\[
T_{15}(x) = 2^{14} x \prod_{k=1}^{7} \left( x - \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) \right).
\]

The constant term of \(T_{15}(x)\) is \(-1\), so we have:

\[
-1 = 2^{14} \prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right).
\]

This implies:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

We are interested in the product \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\), which is part of this product. Notice that:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right).
\]

We know that \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right)}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{1}{4}\), we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = -2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{4}.

However, we need to correct this sign because the product of cosines of angles in the first quadrant is positive. Therefore, the correct value is:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we know that \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

Since \( AD = 10 \) and \( AM = 11 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

We are also given that \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

In \( \triangle BDM \), we can use the Law of Cosines to find \( BD \):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos(\angle BDM)
\]
Since \( \angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta \), we have \( \cos(\angle BDM) = -\cos(3\theta) \). Therefore,
\[
BD^2 = x^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos(3\theta)) = x^2 + 1 + 2x \cos(3\theta)
\]

In \( \triangle ABM \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( AB \):
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have \( AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2} \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), we can use the Law of Cosines again to find \( BC \):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(\angle BDC)
\]
Since \( BD = DC \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), we have:
\[
(2x)^2 = 2BD^2 - 2BD^2 \cos(3\theta) = 2BD^2(1 - \cos(3\theta))

Substituting \( BD^2 = x^2 + 1 + 2x \cos(3\theta) \) into the equation, we get:
\[
4x^2 = 2(x^2 + 1 + 2x \cos(3\theta))(1 - \cos(3\theta))

Simplifying, we have:
\[
4x^2 = 2(x^2 + 1 + 2x \cos(3\theta) - x^2 \cos(3\theta) - \cos(3\theta) - 2x \cos^2(3\theta))

\[
4x^2 = 2(x^2 + 1 + x \cos(3\theta) - \cos(3\theta) - 2x \cos^2(3\theta))
\]
\[
4x^2 = 2x^2 + 2 + 2x \cos(3\theta) - 2\cos(3\theta) - 4x \cos^2(3\theta)

Rearranging terms, we get:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68

The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, let's make a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes a quadratic inequality in terms of \(y\):

\[y^2 + 4y < 21\]

Rearrange this inequality to standard form:

\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\]

Now, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). We can do this using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):

\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3\]
\[y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7\]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative root \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have:

\[0 \leq y < 3\]

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:

\[0 \leq x^2 < 3\]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:

\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

Combining the results from both steps, we find that the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(s\) and \(p\) using the identity:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3sp.
\]
Since \(sp = 24\), we substitute \(24\) for \(sp\) in the equation:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3 \cdot 24,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
or
\[
s^3 = 64.
\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now that we have \(s = 4\), we can find \(p\) using the equation \(sp = 24\):
\[
4p = 24,
\]
or
\[
p = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has a ratio of boys to girls that is closest to \(135\%\), we need to calculate the ratio of boys to girls for each class and compare it to \(135\%\).

First, let's convert \(135\%\) to a decimal:
\[

Next, we calculate the ratio of boys to girls for each class by dividing the percentage of boys by the percentage of girls.

**For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class:**
\[

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{20.6\%}{13.8\%} = \frac{20.6}{13.8} \approx 1.485

**For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class:**
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{11.6\%}{8.6\%} = \frac{11.6}{8.6} \approx 1.349
\]

Now, we compare each ratio to \(1.35\):

- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.043\), which is \(1.35 - 1.043 = 0.307\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.039\), which is \(1.35 - 1.039 = 0.311\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.485\), which is \(1.485 - 1.35 = 0.135\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.349\), which is \(1.35 - 1.349 = 0.001\) away from \(1.35\).

The smallest difference is \(0.001\), which corresponds to the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the roots of the numerator and the denominator, which are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression in that interval.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = (-10)^2 - 36(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = (-1)^2 - 36(-1) = 1 + 36 = 37.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 1^2 - 36(1) = 1 - 36 = -35.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 10^2 - 36(10) = 100 - 360 = -260.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 37^2 - 36(37) = 1369 - 1332 = 37.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

The length of the rectangular field is given as 400 meters. Let's denote the width of the rectangular field by \( w \) meters.

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle with radius \( w/2 \). Therefore, the circumference of one semicircle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = \pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi w}{2}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\), and the side opposite \(\angle R\) is \(ST = 2\).

First, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root (since \(RS\) is a length):
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). By definition, \(\sin{T}\) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite \(\angle T\) to the length of the hypotenuse. The side opposite \(\angle T\) is \(RS = \sqrt{21}\), and the hypotenuse is \(RT = 5\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}

"To find the minimum distance between the point \( P = (0, 1) \) and the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( d \) between a point \( (x, y) \) on the curve and the point \( P \). The distance formula is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + \left( y - 1 \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 1 \right)^2}
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \implies y - 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 1 = \frac{x^2 - 3 - \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus, the distance \( d \) becomes:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{x^2 - 3 - \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{(x^2 - 3 - \sqrt{2})^2}{2}}
\]

Next, expand the square in the numerator:

\[
(x^2 - 3 - \sqrt{2})^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 - 2\sqrt{2}x^2 + 9 + 6\sqrt{2} + 2 = x^4 - (6 + 2\sqrt{2})x^2 + 11 + 6\sqrt{2}
\]

Substitute this back into the expression for \( d \):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{x^4 - (6 + 2\sqrt{2})x^2 + 11 + 6\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2x^2 + x^4 - (6 + 2\sqrt{2})x^2 + 11 + 6\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{x^4 - (4 + 2\sqrt{2})x^2 + 11 + 6\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - (4 + 2\sqrt{2})x^2 + 11 + 6\sqrt{2}}
\]

To minimize \( d \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = x^4 - (4 + 2\sqrt{2})x^2 + 11 + 6\sqrt{2} \). Let \( u = x^2 \). Then \( f(u) = u^2 - (4 + 2\sqrt{2})u + 11 + 6\sqrt{2} \), which is a quadratic function in \( u \). The minimum value of a quadratic function \( au^2 + bu + c \) occurs at \( u = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -(4 + 2\sqrt{2}) \), and \( c = 11 + 6\sqrt{2} \), so:

\[
u = \frac{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 + \sqrt{2}
\]

Substitute \( u = 2 + \sqrt{2} \) back into \( f(u) \):

\[
f(2 + \sqrt{2}) = (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 - (4 + 2\sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2}) + 11 + 6\sqrt{2}
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
(4 + 2\sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2}) = 8 + 4\sqrt{2} + 4\sqrt{2} + 4 = 12 + 8\sqrt{2}
\]

Substitute these values back into \( f(2 + \sqrt{2}) \):

\[
f(2 + \sqrt{2}) = 6 + 4\sqrt{2} - (12 + 8\sqrt{2}) + 11 + 6\sqrt{2} = 6 + 4\sqrt{2} - 12 - 8\sqrt{2} + 11 + 6\sqrt{2} = 5 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of \( d \) is:

\[
d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5 + 2\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4 + 2\sqrt{2} + 1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{(\sqrt{2} + 1)^2}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

The minimum distance is \( \frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \), so \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 2 + 2 = 4 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 4 \):
\[ -(4)^3 + 2(4)^2 + 3(4) - 6 = -64 + 32 + 12 - 6 = -26 \]
So, \( x = 4 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 5 \):
\[ -(5)^3 + 2(5)^2 + 3(5) - 6 = -125 + 50 + 15 - 6 = -66 \]
So, \( x = 5 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 36 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 36 - 6 = 264 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

"To determine the distance from point \( P \) to the center of the cube, we start by identifying the coordinates of the center of the cube. Since the cube is regular and has side length 2 (from the given distances), the center of the cube is at the origin \((0,0,0)\).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of point \( P \). We know the distances from \( P \) to each of the vertices of the cube are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13. Let the coordinates of \( P \) be \((x, y, z)\). The distance from \( P \) to a vertex \((a, b, c)\) is given by the formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2}
\]

We can use the given distances to set up equations. The vertices of the cube are:
\[
A = (1, 0, 0), \quad B = (-1, 0, 0), \quad C = (0, 1, 0), \quad D = (0, -1, 0), \quad E = (0, 0, 1), \quad F = (0, 0, -1)
\]

The distances from \( P \) to these vertices are:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2} = 13
\]

We square each equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2 = 169
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10

Similarly, we subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 55

\[
y^2 - 2y + 2x = 55

\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 81 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 2x = 72
\]

We subtract the first equation from the fifth:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 121 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 112
\]
\[
y^2 + z^2 + 2x - 2z = 112

We subtract the first equation from the sixth:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 169 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2z + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 160
\]
\[
y^2 + z^2 + 2x + 2z = 160
\]

We now have the system of equations:
\[
y^2 - 2y + 2x = 55
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 2x = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + z^2 + 2x - 2z = 112
\]
\[
y^2 + z^2 + 2x + 2z = 160
\]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(y^2 + 2y + 2x) - (y^2 - 2y + 2x) = 72 - 55
\]
\[
4y = 17

\[
y = \frac{17}{4}

Subtract the third equation from the fourth:
\[
(y^2 + z^2 + 2x + 2z) - (y^2 + z^2 + 2x - 2z) = 160 - 112

\[
4z = 48

\[
z = 12

Now we have \( x = 10 \), \( y = \frac{17}{4} \), and \( z = 12 \). The distance from \( P \) to the center of the cube is:

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the center of the cube is:

"To solve the problem, we start by using Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Given:
- The mass of the soft ball (\( m_1 \)) is 200 g.
- The mass of the base ball (\( m_2 \)) is 150 g.
- The force applied to both balls is the same, so \( F_1 = F_2 \).

Using Newton's second law for each ball, we have:

\[ F_1 = m_1 \cdot a_1 \]
\[ F_2 = m_2 \cdot a_2 \]

Since \( F_1 = F_2 \), we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_1 \cdot a_1 = m_2 \cdot a_2 \]

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_1 = 150 \cdot a_2 \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the base ball, we solve for \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \):

\[ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{150}{200} \]

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

\[ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the base ball is:

   - Each swan pairs its feet together to form a foot pair.
   - Each foot pair can either be on the left hand or the right hand.

   - Since there are 9 foot pairs on the left hand and 9 foot pairs on the right hand, and each foot pair on the left hand must either be on the right hand or not on the right hand, the number of foot pairs on the left hand that are not on the right hand is:
     \[

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

The equation of the perpendicular line passing through \( (6, 0) \) is given by:

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. Then we have:
\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

Next, we consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2, \alpha_1\alpha_3, \alpha_1\alpha_4, \alpha_2\alpha_3, \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_3\alpha_4\). The sum of the roots taken two at a time is given by:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2 \cdot (-2) = -4.
\]

The product of the roots taken three at a time is given by:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2^2 \cdot (-2) = -8.
\]

The product of the roots taken six at a time is given by:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^3 = 2^3 = 8.
\]

The polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2, \alpha_1\alpha_3, \alpha_1\alpha_4, \alpha_2\alpha_3, \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_3\alpha_4\) is:
\[
t^6 - (-4)t^4 + (-8)t^2 - 8 = t^6 + 4t^4 - 8t^2 - 8.
\]

The roots of this polynomial are \(\pm \sqrt{2}, \pm \sqrt{2}i\). Therefore, the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are \(\sqrt{2}\), \(\sqrt{2}\), \(-\sqrt{2}\), \(-\sqrt{2}\), \(2i\), and \(-2i\). Since \(a + b + c = 0\), the only possible sets of values are \(\{\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}\}\) and \(\{2i, 2i, -2i\}\). However, since the roots are complex and the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots must come in conjugate pairs. Therefore, the only possible set is \(\{\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2}, 0\}\).

"Let's define the variables for the problem:
- Let \( p \) be the cost of one pen.
- Let \( e \) be the cost of one eraser.

We are given two equations based on the information provided:
1. The cost of three pens and one eraser is $1.24.
2. The cost of five pens and one eraser is $1.82.

We can write these equations as:
\[ 3p + e = 1.24 \]
\[ 5p + e = 1.82 \]

To eliminate \( e \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (5p + e) - (3p + e) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 5p + e - 3p - e = 0.58 \]
\[ 2p = 0.58 \]

Now, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{0.58}{2} \]
\[ p = 0.29 \]

So, the cost of one pen is \( \$0.29 \).

Therefore, the cost of one pen in cents is:

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Set up the division**: We need to divide 137 by 500. Since 137 is less than 500, we will add decimal places to 137 by appending zeros. This gives us 137.000.

2. **Perform the division**:
   - **First digit after the decimal point**: how many times does 500 go into 1370? It goes 2 times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\). Write 2 above the first zero after the decimal point.
   - **Subtract**: Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
   - **Next digit after the decimal point**: how many times does 500 go into 3700? It goes 7 times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\). Write 7 above the next zero after the decimal point.
   - **Subtract**: Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get a remainder of 200.
   - **Next digit after the decimal point**: how many times does 500 go into 2000? It goes 4 times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\). Write 4 above the next zero after the decimal point.
   - **Subtract**: Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete. The decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is 0.274.

3. **Identify the last non-zero digit**: In the decimal 0.274, the last non-zero digit is 4.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) inside the rectangle \( ABCD \) is closer to the center \( O \) than to any of the four vertices \( A, B, C, \) or \( D \).

First, let's place the rectangle \( ABCD \) in the coordinate plane with center \( O \) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \( A = (-a, b) \)
- \( B = (a, b) \)
- \( C = (a, -b) \)
- \( D = (-a, -b) \)

Given that \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \), we have:
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \implies a = kb
\]

The equation of the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \( O \) and \( A \) is:
\[
y = \frac{b}{a}x = \frac{b}{kb}x = \frac{1}{k}x
\]

Similarly, the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments joining \( O \) and \( B \), \( O \) and \( C \), and \( O \) and \( D \) are:
\[
y = -\frac{1}{k}x, \quad y = \frac{1}{k}x, \quad y = -\frac{1}{k}x
\]

These bisectors form a square centered at \( O \) with vertices at:
\[
\left( \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+k^2}}, \pm \frac{b}{\sqrt{1+k^2}} \right)
\]

The side length of this square is:
\[
\text{Side length} = 2 \times \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+k^2}} = 2 \times \frac{kb}{\sqrt{1+k^2}} = \frac{2kb}{\sqrt{1+k^2}}

The area of the square is:
\[
\text{Area of the square} = \left( \frac{2kb}{\sqrt{1+k^2}} \right)^2 = \frac{4k^2b^2}{1+k^2}

The area of the rectangle \( ABCD \) is:

"To determine the remainder when \(54\) is divided by \(6\), we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division of \(54\) by \(6\):
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9

   This tells us that \(54\) divided by \(6\) gives a quotient of \(9\).

2. To find the remainder, we can use the relationship between the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder}

   Subtract \(54\) from both sides to solve for the remainder:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

1. **Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):**
   - First, determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \).
     \[
     \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472
     \]
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function:
     \[
     f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil
     \]
   - The ceiling function \( \lceil x \rceil \) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( x \). Therefore:
     \[
     \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2
     \]

2. **Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):**
   - First, determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \).
     \[
     \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \times 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 \approx 6.708
     \]
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function:
     \[
     f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor
     \]
   - The floor function \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) gives the largest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Therefore:
     \[
     \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6
     \]

3. **Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):**
   - First, determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \).
     \[
     8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^{3 \times \frac{2}{3}} = 2^2 = 4
     \]
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function:
     \[
     f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor
     \]
   - The floor function \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) gives the largest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Therefore:
     \[
     \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4
     \]

Finally, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[
f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12

First, let's calculate the total score of all the students. We know that:
- 20 students scored 80 marks each.
- 8 students scored 90 marks each.
- 2 students scored 100 marks each.

So, the total score is:

\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Next, we add these scores together:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) grid where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same, we need to set up equations based on this condition.

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sum of the numbers in each row is the same, we equate the sums of the first and second rows:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 - 2n = 3n - 6 - 2n

\[

\[

\[

To verify, we check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

**Sum of the first column:**
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

**Sum of the second column:**
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]

**Sum of the third column:**
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

**Sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):**
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 14 - 9 + 6 = 15

\[

"To determine how much farther Jimee has to walk than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them walks and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jimee walks. Jimee walks along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. So, we have:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]
Therefore, Jimee walks 500 feet.

Therefore, Martha walks 700 feet.

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance Martha walks and the distance Jimee walks:

They satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can substitute \(\omega + \omega^2\) with \(-1\):
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\) and the fact that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

Specifically, we need to find the point \( P \) that minimizes the sum of the distances to these four points.

The point that minimizes the sum of the distances to a set of points in a plane is known as the Fermat-Weber point. For a set of four points, the Fermat-Weber point is the point where the sum of the distances to the four points is minimized. However, there is no simple formula to find the Fermat-Weber point for four points in general. Instead, we can use a known result from geometry.

For four points that form a square, the Fermat-Weber point is the center of the square. This is because the center of the square is equidistant from all four vertices, and any other point will have a greater sum of distances to the vertices.

Let's assume the points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) form a square with side length \( s \). The center of the square is the point that is equidistant from all four vertices. The distance from the center of the square to any vertex is the length of the diagonal of a smaller square with side length \( s/2 \), which is \( \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
