"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\).

Given:
\[
\sin D = 0.7
\]
\[
EF = 7
\]

We can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\):
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DF\) is the hypotenuse and \(EF\) and \(DE\) are the legs of the right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To find \(DE^2\), we solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is:

"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

   Simplify each term:
   \[
   = \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} - 3i \frac{2}{2} - 3i^2 \frac{2}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system:**
   Add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around the table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is:
\[

Thus, the number of ways is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each factor modulo 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder of 4 modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.

Next, find the remainder of 6 modulo 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.

\[

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), and knowing that \(x > 7\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. Let's consider the other possibility, which is that the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is bisected by the diagonal connecting \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\).

First, find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Again, \(x = 4\) is not a valid solution because \(x > 7\). Finally, let's consider the possibility that the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is bisected by the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\).

First, find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:

"To find \(\tan A\) given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\) in a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute this into the tangent formula:

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can simplify the expression by canceling \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as these values will cause the function to approach infinity or negative infinity.

First, we factor the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7
\]
\[
x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
\]
Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by analyzing the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[

\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( \lambda_1 = 16 \). Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Hence, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for all 2-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\),

The fifth roots of unity are \( 1, z, z^2, z^3, z^4 \), and they satisfy the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Using the property of fifth roots of unity, we know that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one trick.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one square.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one curl.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. Seven tricks have the same weight as three squares and one curl. This can be written as:

   \]
2. Two tricks and one curl have the same weight as one square. This can be written as:

We need to eliminate \( G \) from these equations to find a relationship between \( T \) and \( S \). First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:

We know that this polynomial must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per minute, and the height of the water is rising at a rate of 4 meters per minute. This means that the volume of water added per minute is equal to the rate of change of the volume with respect to time, \( \frac{dV}{dt} \), and the height of the water added per minute is equal to the rate of change of the height with respect to time, \( \frac{dh}{dt} \). Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case \(x \geq a\):
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval occurs at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
If \(a > 0\), then \(f(x) \geq a^3\) for all \(x \geq a\). If \(a < 0\), then \(f(x) \leq a^3\) for all \(x \geq a\).

Next, consider the case \(x < a\):
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a line with slope \(a\). The value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left is:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]
If \(a > 0\), then \(f(x)\) is increasing and \(f(x) < a^2 + 2a\) for all \(x < a\). If \(a < 0\), then \(f(x)\) is decreasing and \(f(x) > a^2 + 2a\) for all \(x < a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must be all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

If \(a > 0\):
- The minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\).
- The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\).
We need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\):
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2)\) and \((2, \infty)\). Testing a point in each interval:
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \(1(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = -2 \leq 0\), so the inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \(3(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = 12 > 0\), so the inequality does not hold.
Thus, the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for \(0 < a \leq 2\).

If \(a < 0\):
- The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\).
- The minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\).
We need \(a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a\):
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0. \]
The roots of the equation are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the intervals \((-\infty, -1)\) and \((-1, 0)\). Testing a point in each interval:
- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \(-2(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = 8 > 0\), so the inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \(-0.5(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = -0.375 < 0\), so the inequality does not hold.
Thus, the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0\) holds for \(a \leq -1\).

Combining both cases, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To find the value of \( c \) in the equation of the circle \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

Given that the radius \( r \) is 1, the standard form becomes \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = 1^2 = 1\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms in the given equation.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since we know the standard form of the circle's equation is \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 1\), we can set the right sides equal to each other:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). Since \(\lambda > 0\), the inequality \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) simplifies to \(\lambda \ge 1\), and the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is always true. Therefore, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\), so \(y\) is also a fixed point of \(f\). Since \(f(x) \neq x\), \(y \neq x\). Therefore, the fixed points of \(f\) must be distinct, which means \(\lambda \ge 2\) (because if \(\lambda = 1\), the only fixed point is \(x = 0\)).

Now, we need to check if there exists \(x\) such that \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) and \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = x\). We already know that \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), so \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, which is not what we want. Therefore, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

We solve the equation \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x) = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
The solutions to this quadratic equation are:
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \sqrt{\lambda^4 - 4\lambda^2(\lambda - 1)}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \sqrt{\lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{\lambda} + \frac{4}{\lambda^2}}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda^2 \left(1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right)}{2\lambda^2}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 + \lambda^2 - 2\lambda}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{2\lambda^2 - 2\lambda}{2\lambda^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda},
\]
and
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 + 2\lambda}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{2\lambda}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) and \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\). We need to check if these solutions satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\).

For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\):
\[
f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
Then,
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
So, \(f(f(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda})) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\):
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
Then,
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
So, \(f(f(\frac{1}{\lambda})) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 2\).

"To find the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) that satisfies the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\).

The given expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:
\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these formulas, we can rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Similarly, we can rewrite the denominator as:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ (-\sin 30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

The maximum value of \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\) is 1, which occurs when \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi\) for any integer \(k\). Since \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}\), the only possible value is \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

1. Substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \) into the formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",350,"[350, '350']",True

"To find the number of two-digit positive integers that are common divisors of 100 and 150, we need to determine the common divisors of 100 and 150 and then count the two-digit ones.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. Therefore, the common divisors of 100 and 150 are the divisors of \(2 \times 5^2 = 50\). Let's list the divisors of 50:

Now, we identify the two-digit divisors from this list:

"To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as a perfect \( n \)-th power. This means there exists an integer \( k \) such that

\[ 2^{24} = k^n. \]

Since the left side of the equation is a power of 2, \( k \) must also be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2^m \) into the equation, we get

\[ 2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn}. \]

For the equation \( 2^{24} = 2^{mn} \) to hold, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, we have

\[ 24 = mn. \]

We need to find all pairs \((m, n)\) of positive integers such that \( mn = 24 \) and \( n > 1 \). First, we list the factors of 24:

2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents:

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 11 - x

Next, we substitute \( y \) into the second equation:

Now, simplify the equation:

\[

\[
5x = 75 - 55

\[

"To determine the total area of the shaded region in the given diagram, we need to analyze the two overlapping right triangles formed by the diagonals of the two 1x1 squares.

First, let's identify the two right triangles:
1. The first right triangle has its vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The second right triangle has its vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

Both triangles share the same height of 4 units but have different bases. The base of the first triangle is 2 units, and the base of the second triangle is 3 units.

The area of a right triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Let's calculate the area of each triangle:
1. The area of the first triangle is:
\[

\]
2. The area of the second triangle is:

Since the two triangles overlap in a smaller right triangle with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((2, 0)\), and \((3, 0)\), we need to subtract the area of this overlapping triangle to avoid double-counting. The base of the overlapping triangle is 1 unit (from 2 to 3), and the height is 4 units. Therefore, the area of the overlapping triangle is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25. \]
A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's analyze these divisibility rules one by one:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00 or 25 or 50 or 75. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00.

   - The first digit can be any number from 1 to 4 (since it is the remainder when divided by 4).
   - The second digit can be any number from 1 to 3 (since it is the remainder when divided by 5).

2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - There are 4 possible outcomes for the first digit.
   - There are 3 possible outcomes for the second digit.
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

3. **Identify the pattern of shaded squares on the checkerboard:**

   - Therefore, there are 6 shaded squares and 6 unshaded squares.

4. **Determine the probability that the checker lands on a shaded square:**

"To find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, calculate the denominator:

\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,

\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x)\) is given by:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Let \(x = 20^\circ\), then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

Dividing both sides by 180, we get:

\[
n-2 \approx \frac{1070}{180} \approx 5.9444
\]

Adding 2 to both sides, we get:

\[
n \approx 7.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we test \(n = 7\) and \(n = 8\).

If \(n = 7\), the sum of the interior angles is:

\[
180(7-2) = 900^\circ
\]

This means the excluded angle \(x\) would be:

\[
x = 900 - 1070 = -170^\circ

Since \(x\) cannot be negative, \(n = 7\) is not a valid solution.

If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles is:

\[
180(8-2) = 1080^\circ
\]

This means the excluded angle \(x\) would be:

\[
x = 1080 - 1070 = 10^\circ

Since \(0 < x < 180^\circ\), \(n = 8\) is a valid solution.

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test the values from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[ 1^2 = 1, \quad 2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 6^2 = 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}, \quad 7^2 = 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \quad 8^2 = 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 9^2 = 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \quad 10^2 = 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \quad 11^2 = 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}. \]
Thus, the modular square root of 2 modulo 23 is 5. Therefore, we have:
\[ t = -1 \pm 5. \]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4, \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since \( t \) must be a positive integer less than 23, we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). However, we are asked to find the unique odd integer \( t \), so we need to check if there are any other solutions. The other solution to the quadratic congruence is:
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]
Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:
\[ t = 17. \]
Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{17}. \]","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True
"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot in square inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the cube in feet:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3

   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:

"To find the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to multiply \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"The given sequence is \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), which is an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

For our sequence, substituting \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula, we get:

2. Subtract 1 from \( f(5) \).

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]

Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[

\]

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

"To find the distance between two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:
\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we can use the fact that the distance between two parallel lines is the length of the perpendicular segment between them. This perpendicular segment is along the direction vector that is perpendicular to the direction vector of the lines. Since the direction vectors are parallel (one is a scalar multiple of the other), we can use the direction vector of either line.

The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, we can use \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

The distance between the two lines is the length of the projection of the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line onto the vector \(\mathbf{d}\). Let's choose the points \(\mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector connecting these points is:

\]

The distance is the magnitude of the cross product of this vector with the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) divided by the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}\):
\[
\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, we find the cross product:
\[
\mathbf{d} \times \left( \mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0) \right) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} \left( -9 \cdot 5 - (-2) \cdot 7 \right) - \mathbf{j} \left( 2 \cdot 5 - (-2) \cdot (-8) \right) + \mathbf{k} \left( 2 \cdot 7 - (-9) \cdot (-8) \right).
\]
\[

\]

Next, we find the magnitude of this cross product:
\[
\left\| \mathbf{d} \times \left( \mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0) \right) \right\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):
\[
\left\| \mathbf{d} \right\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance between the two lines is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\left\| \mathbf{d} \times \left( \mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0) \right) \right\|}{\left\| \mathbf{d} \right\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

1. **Identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values for the interior points:**
   - The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-5\) to \(5\). For a point to be strictly inside the rectangle, its \(x\)-coordinate must be strictly between \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, the possible integer \(x\)-coordinates are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).
   - The \(y\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-4\) to \(4\). For a point to be strictly inside the rectangle, its \(y\)-coordinate must be strictly between \(-4\) and \(4\). Therefore, the possible integer \(y\)-coordinates are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\).

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{z}\),

\[

Applying this property, we get

\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Now, we substitute the given values of the cross products:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.

So the expression becomes

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

- Brazil: 12 stamps, each costing 6 cents
- France: 12 stamps, each costing 4 cents

We know that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h

To find \(h\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the base \(a\) of \(\triangle ACD\) is part of the base \(a + b\) of the trapezoid. However, we do not need the exact value of \(a\) or \(b\) to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar in a certain sense, but we only need the total area and the height to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

Given that the total area of the trapezoid is 42 and the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because the base \(a\) is part of the total base \(a + b\):

However, since we do not have the exact ratio of \(a\) to \(a + b\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:

[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To solve the problem, we need to use the definition of the operation @ given in the problem. The operation @ is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

We are given the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). According to the definition, we substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the expression:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)

We can simplify this by canceling the \(10\) in the denominator with the \(70\) in the numerator:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are \(4\) points, and we need to pair them into two line segments. The number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 for the first segment is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\). However, since the order in which we choose the pairs does not matter, we divide by 2. Therefore, the total number of ways to pair the points is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

2. **Determine the number of ways the line segments intersect:**
   For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). There are exactly 2 such arrangements out of the 6 possible pairings.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of intersecting pairings to the total number of pairings. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

"To find the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the given sector. The area of the larger circle is:

The area of the smaller circle is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The total area of the two circles is:
\[

The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The shaded region is a sector of the larger circle with radius 2. The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]
where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius. For the larger circle, the area of the sector is:

"To determine how many cylindrical mugs are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the mugs and the tank and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the mug's volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical mug. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical mug, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we find the number of cylindrical mugs needed to fill the spherical tank by dividing the volume of the tank by the volume of one mug:
\[ \text{Number of mugs} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, the expression becomes \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A)
\]

This is a product of two binomials, which can be expanded as:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A = 2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]

Notice that the terms \(\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A\) and \(-\cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A\) cancel each other out. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A = 2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]

We can use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\) to express \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\) in terms of \(\sin A\) and \(\sin B\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right) \left(0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4\right)
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we have:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9

So the equation becomes:

The sum of these 27 integers can be calculated as follows:

\[
a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\), the last term \(a+26\), and the number of terms 27. The sum \(S\) of an arithmetic series is given by:

We know that the sum of these 27 integers is \(3^7\). Therefore, we can write:

"To determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ (x^2)^2 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:

Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), the absolute value can be removed:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:

Since \( x^2 \) is always non-negative, the left part of the inequality \( -2 < x^2 \) is always true. Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:
\[ x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:

4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),

\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).

Next, we use the identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting the given value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 4p).
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 4p^3}{p^2},
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12(144 - 4p^3)}{p^3},
\]
\[
-8p^3 = 12(144 - 4p^3),

\[
-8p^3 = 1728 - 48p^3,

\[

"To determine which grade has the number of male bus users closest to 135% of the number of female bus users, we need to calculate the number of male and female bus users for each grade and then find the grade where the ratio of male to female bus users is closest to 135%.

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus users for each grade:

1. **9th Grade:**
   - Male bus users: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\)
   - Female bus users: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.0424\)

2. **10th Grade:**
   - Male bus users: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103\)
   - Female bus users: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.0404\)

3. **11th Grade:**

   - Female bus users: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.3462\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

### Step 1: Factor the denominator
The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the numerator
The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of a quadratic expression. We can factor \(x^2 - 81\) as:
\[
x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9)
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|
\]

### Step 3: Determine the critical points
The critical points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. These points are:
\[
x = 0, \quad x = 9, \quad x = -9, \quad x = 36
\]

### Step 4: Test the intervals determined by the critical points
We need to test the sign of the expression \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

#### Interval \((-\infty, -9)\)
Choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10 - 9)(-10 + 9)|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{10 \cdot (-46)} = \frac{19}{-460} < 0
\]
The expression is negative.

#### Interval \((-9, 0)\)
Choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1 - 9)(-1 + 9)|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{1 \cdot (-37)} = \frac{80}{-37} < 0
\]
The expression is negative.

#### Interval \((0, 9)\)
Choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1 - 9)(1 + 9)|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1 \cdot (-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0
\]
The expression is negative.

#### Interval \((9, 36)\)
Choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|(10 - 9)(10 + 9)|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|(1)(19)|}{10 \cdot (-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0
\]
The expression is negative.

#### Interval \((36, \infty)\)
Choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|(37 - 9)(37 + 9)|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|(28)(46)|}{37 \cdot 1} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive.

### Step 5: Consider the critical points
The expression \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.

### Step 6: Combine the results
The expression is negative in the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by understanding the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the sine function. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.

Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can denote the length of the side opposite to angle \(R\) as \(2k\) and the length of the hypotenuse as \(5k\), where \(k\) is a positive constant. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):

\[
(5k)^2 = (2k)^2 + \text{(adjacent side)}^2
\]
\[
25k^2 = 4k^2 + \text{(adjacent side)}^2
\]
\[
\text{(adjacent side)}^2 = 21k^2
\]
\[
\text{(adjacent side)} = \sqrt{21}k
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is the same as the adjacent side to angle \(R\), which is \(\sqrt{21}k\), and the hypotenuse is the same as the hypotenuse of the triangle, which is \(5k\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}k}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"To find the shortest distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the graph \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance \(d\) from the origin to this point is given by the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To minimize \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by finding the critical points of \(f(x)\) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(d\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}

In this form, \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\). The final answer is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors: \( x = 0 \) and \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions.

Therefore, the only solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Therefore, the only solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the solutions:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular tetrahedron, we start by considering the properties of a regular tetrahedron and the given distances from \( P \) to the five vertices.

A regular tetrahedron has four vertices, and the problem states that the distances from \( P \) to five of these vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Since a regular tetrahedron has only four vertices, one of these distances must be repeated or correspond to a vertex that is not part of the tetrahedron but rather a point in space relative to the tetrahedron.

However, the problem can be solved by considering the geometric properties and symmetry of the tetrahedron. The key insight is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron is constant and equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the tetrahedron to the vertices plus the square of the distance from the point to the center of the tetrahedron.

Given the distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of these distances is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the tetrahedron to the vertices plus the square of the distance from \( P \) to the center of the tetrahedron.

The sum of the squares of the given distances is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324. \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the tetrahedron to the vertices is a constant, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex must be such that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the tetrahedron to the vertices plus the square of the distance from \( P \) to the center of the tetrahedron.

" first, we need to understand the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), or mathematically:

\[
F = m \cdot a
\]

In this scenario, we have two objects: a baseball and a softball. The masses of these objects are given as follows:

- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \, \text{g} \)
- Mass of the softball, \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \, \text{g} \)

Since both balls are being thrown with the same force (the force exerted by the pitcher), we can denote this force as \( F \).

Now, we can express the acceleration of each ball in terms of the force and its mass:

1. For the baseball:
\[
a_{\text{baseball}} = \frac{F}{m_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{F}{150}
\]

2. For the softball:
\[
a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{F}{m_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{F}{200}

Next, we need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{\frac{F}{200}}{\frac{F}{150}}

2. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 50:

Expanding this product is quite complex, so instead, we can use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and the expressions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are symmetric sums of the products of the roots. By symmetry and the properties of the roots of the polynomial, we can deduce that the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 + 2t^2 + 2 = 0\). Solving this polynomial, we get
\[
t = -1 \pm i, \quad t = -1.
\]

Therefore, the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are \(-1 + i\), \(-1 - i\), and \(-1\). The set of these values is

"To determine the last non-zero digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to convert the fraction into a decimal. We can do this by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

First, we note that \(500 = 5^3 \times 2^2\). To simplify the division, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^2 = 4\):
\[
\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137 \times 4}{500 \times 4} = \frac{548}{2000}
\]
Now, we perform the division \(548 \div 2000\):
\[
548 \div 2000 = 0.274
\]
So, the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

The digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit in this sequence is 4.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Let the coordinates of \(A\) be \((-a, b)\), \(B\) be \((a, b)\), \(C\) be \((a, -b)\), and \(D\) be \((-a, -b)\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(2a / 2b = k\) or \(a = kb\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A(-a, b)\), is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). We need to find the region where \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\), and similarly for the other vertices.

Squaring both sides of the inequality \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\), we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:
\[x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2,\]
\[0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2,\]
\[2by < 2ax + a^2 + b^2,\]
\[y < \frac{a}{b}x + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}.\]
Since \(a = kb\), this becomes:
\[y < kx + \frac{k^2b^2 + b^2}{2b} = kx + \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{2b} = kx + \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2}.\]
Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other vertices:
\[y > -kx + \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2},\]
\[y < kx - \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2},\]
\[y > -kx - \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2}.\]
These four inequalities define a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{k}\) and \(\frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{k}\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[\left(\frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{k}\right) \left(\frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{k}\right) = \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)^2}{k^2}.\]
The area of the original rectangle is:
\[2a \cdot 2b = 4ab = 4kb^2.\]
The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[\frac{\frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)^2}{k^2}}{4kb^2} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^3}.\]
Thus, the probability is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many cents remained after converting the total amount of money into dollars and then into the largest possible number of dollars and cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money collected.
2. Convert the total amount into cents.
3. Determine the largest possible number of dollars and cents after converting the total amount into dollars and then into the largest possible number of dollars and cents.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money collected:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \$27.47 + \$35.23 + \$37.37 + \$26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money collected is \$126.59.

Next, we convert this total amount into cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we need to determine the largest possible number of dollars and cents after converting the total amount into dollars and then into the largest possible number of dollars and cents. Since 12659 cents is equivalent to 126 dollars and 59 cents, the largest possible number of dollars and cents is 126 dollars and 59 cents.

Therefore, the number of cents that remained is:
\[
\boxed{59}

"To find the class average score, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score:
- 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these total scores to get the overall total score:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Next, we divide the overall total score by the number of students to find the average score:
\[\text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):

The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The main diagonal contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

The other main diagonal contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n+1 = 8 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
2 + 5 + 8 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how much shorter the distance that 짐 walks compared to the distance that 마사 walks, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance that 짐 walks. 짐은 필드를 대각선으로 가로질러 걷습니다. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
For the given field, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Therefore, the distance that 짐 walks is:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance that 마사 walks. 마사는 길이와 너비를 따라 걸어서 same position에 도착합니다. Therefore, the distance that 마사 walks is the sum of the length and the width of the field:
\[ \text{Distance} = l + w = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the difference between the distance that 마사 walks and the distance that 짐 walks:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \(\omega\) is a complex number satisfying \(\omega^3 = 1\). This implies that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the identity \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
