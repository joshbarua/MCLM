"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\).

Given:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
and
\[
EF = 7
\]
we can substitute these values into the equation to find \(DF\):
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, \(EF\) is one leg, and \(DE\) is the other leg. Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}i}{2} + \frac{6\sqrt{2}i^2}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]
\[121 \div 11 = 11\]
\[11 \div 11 = 1\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor separately:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that 3 specific people (Pierr, Rose, and Thomas) sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierr, Rose, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"".** This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table. The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

2. **Arrange Pierr, Rose, and Thomas within their block.** There are 3 people in the block, and they can be arranged among themselves in \(3! = 6\) ways.

3. **Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" by the number of ways to arrange Pierr, Rose, and Thomas within their block.** This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierr, Rose, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7. We start by substituting \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression.

First, we calculate each term in the product modulo 7:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, we substitute these congruences back into the product:

Next, we calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \):
\[

We then find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must rotate counterclockwise around its center to match its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles.

A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5 equal angles. The total angle around the center of the pentagon is 360 degrees. Since the pentagon is regular, it will look the same after being rotated by an angle that is a fraction of 360 degrees corresponding to the number of sides. Specifically, the pentagon will look the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

Calculating this, we get:

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid either. Let's consider the last possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes, the horizontal asymptote, and then sum the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is \( 2x \), so:
\[ 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]

Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Sum the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)
We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

\[ \boxed{5} \]","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will start by expressing all trigonometric functions in terms of sine and cosine. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we simplify the first term by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now that the terms have the same denominator, we can combine them into a single fraction:

We use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) to simplify the numerator:

- Let \( G \) be the weight of one golf ball.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The weight of ten tricycles is equal to the weight of three skivags and one golf ball:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]

2. The weight of two tricycles and one golf ball is equal to the weight of one skivag:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find the weight of a single tricycle in terms of the weight of a single skivag and a single golf ball. Let's start by solving the second equation for \( S \):
\[
S = 2T + G
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( S \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3(2T + G) + G
\]

Now, we expand and simplify the right-hand side:
\[
10T = 6T + 3G + G
\]
\[
10T = 6T + 4G
\]

Next, we isolate \( T \) by subtracting \( 6T \) from both sides:
\[
4T = 4G
\]

Finally, we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[
T = G
\]

So, the weight of a single tricycle is equal to the weight of a single golf ball. Therefore, the weight of a single tricycle is \(\boxed{G}\).","[G, 'G']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\):
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\):
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\):
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
   \]
   This is true.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), which must equal \(6\):
   \[

   This is true.

Since all the coefficients match, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To find the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the information given in the problem. The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the water in the tank. The rate at which the volume is changing is the derivative of the volume with respect to time, which can be expressed as:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know from the problem that \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) cubic meters per hour and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\) meters per hour. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To isolate \(r^2\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\):

\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) defined piecewise:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first piece \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x \geq a \).
2. **Behavior**: Since \( a \) is a constant, the function \( ax^2 \) is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).
3. **Minimum/Maximum**: 
   - If \( a > 0 \), the minimum value occurs at \( x = a \), giving \( f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \).
   - If \( a < 0 \), the maximum value occurs at \( x = a \), giving \( f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the second piece \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x < a \).
2. **Behavior**: This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \).
3. **Value at \( x = a \)**: As \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left, \( f(x) \) approaches \( a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a \).

### Step 3: Determine the range of \( f(x) \)

1. **For \( x \geq a \)**:
   - If \( a > 0 \), the range is \( [a^3, \infty) \).
   - If \( a < 0 \), the range is \( (-\infty, a^3] \).

2. **For \( x < a \)**:
   - The range is \( (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \) if \( a > 0 \).
   - The range is \( (a^2 + 2a, \infty) \) if \( a < 0 \).

### Step 4: Ensure intersection with every horizontal line

For the graph of \( y = f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the ranges of both pieces must cover all real numbers. This means:

- If \( a > 0 \), the range must be \( (-\infty, \infty) \). This requires \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \).
- If \( a < 0 \), the range must also be \( (-\infty, \infty) \). This requires \( a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a \).

### Step 5: Solve the inequalities

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   \[
   a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \implies a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0
   \]
   The roots of \( a^2 - a - 2 = 0 \) are \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -1 \). Since \( a > 0 \), we consider \( a \in (0, 2] \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   \[
   a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a \implies a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0
   \]
   The roots are the same, but since \( a < 0 \), we consider \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \).

### Step 6: Find the largest value of \( a \)

The largest value of \( a \) that satisfies the condition for \( a > 0 \) is \( a = 2 \).

Thus, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda > 1\)).

Next, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's start by expressing \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
We can factor out \(x\) from both sides:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\).
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

The first case \(x = 0\) is a fixed point, so we discard it. We need to solve the second equation:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 = 1 \implies -\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this cubic equation has a root \(x \in [0,1]\) that is not a fixed point. We already know that \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda > 1\)) are fixed points, so we need to check if the cubic equation has a root in \([0,1]\) that is different from these fixed points.

By analyzing the behavior of the function and the cubic equation, we find that the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are \(\lambda = 2\) and \(\lambda = 4\). For these values, the cubic equation has a root in \([0,1]\) that is not a fixed point.

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) are:

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To find the value of \(\theta\), we can use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can further simplify this by recognizing that \(\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ\) and \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), and using the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 40^\circ\):
\[
\tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\cos 40^\circ} = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\sin 50^\circ} = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\cos 40^\circ} = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\cos 40^\circ} = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\cos 40^\circ} = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\cos 40^\circ}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By continuing this pattern, we can see that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of the centroid and similar triangles. The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

Given that the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \), we can use the fact that \( \triangle AMN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. Since \( MN \parallel BC \), the corresponding angles \( \angle AMN = \angle ABC \) and \( \angle ANM = \angle ACB \) are equal.

The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians. Since \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), the ratio of the sides of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 2:3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \).

The area of \( \triangle AMN \) is:

- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Polly and Gadi is even, we first need to identify the six smallest prime numbers. These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of these numbers. Among the six smallest prime numbers, there is one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

The sum of two numbers is even if and only if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Therefore, we need to calculate the probability of the following two scenarios:
1. Polly chooses an even number and Gadi chooses an even number.
2. Polly chooses an odd number and Gadi chooses an odd number.

First, let's calculate the probability of the first scenario:
- The probability that Polly chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
- The probability that Gadi chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
- Therefore, the probability that both Polly and Gadi choose even numbers is \(\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}\).

- The probability that Polly chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\).

First, let's identify the dimensions of the rectangle. The rectangle is formed by 14 squares, each with a side length of 1 unit. The arrangement of these squares suggests that the rectangle has a width of 3 units and a height of 4 units. Therefore, the area of the entire rectangle is:

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Since the number must consist only of the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to be divisible by 25. Additionally, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 to be divisible by 9.

Let's denote the number as \( N \). Since \( N \) ends in 00, we can write \( N \) as \( 100M \) where \( M \) is a number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We can use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

   The measure of the missing angle \(x\) must be less than \(180^\circ\) because it is an interior angle of a convex polygon. Therefore, we can find the range for \(x\) by considering the maximum possible value for \(x\), which is just less than \(180^\circ\).

3. **Estimate the number of sides \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the approximate value of \(n\) by assuming \(x\) is close to \(0^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round \(5.9444\) to the next whole number, which is \(6\). Therefore, \(n\) is likely to be \(6\).

4. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 6\), the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   (6-2) \times 180^\circ = 4 \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ
   \]
   The measure of the missing angle \(x\) is:
   \[
   x = 720^\circ - 1070^\circ = -350^\circ
   \]
   This value is not possible because it is negative. Therefore, we need to check the next possible value for \(n\).

   If \(n = 7\), the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   The measure of the missing angle \(x\) is:
   \[
   x = 900^\circ - 1070^\circ = -170^\circ
   \]
   This value is still not possible because it is negative. Therefore, we need to check the next possible value for \(n\).

   If \(n = 8\), the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   The measure of the missing angle \(x\) is:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   This value is possible because it is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(8\).

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test the values from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[ 1^2 = 1, \quad 2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 6^2 = 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}, \quad 7^2 = 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \quad 8^2 = 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 9^2 = 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \quad 10^2 = 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \quad 11^2 = 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}. \]
Thus, the modular square root of 2 modulo 23 is 5. Therefore, we have:
\[ t = -1 \pm 5. \]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4, \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since we are looking for a positive integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). We need to check if \( t = 4 \) is odd. Since 4 is even, it is not a solution. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

We need to find the correct odd solution. Let's re-evaluate the quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We can use the quadratic formula again, but this time we need to find the correct odd solution. We can test the values of \( t \) from 1 to 22:
\[ t = 1: \quad 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 - 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 3: \quad 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 14 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 5: \quad 5^2 + 2 \cdot 5 - 1 = 34 \equiv 11 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 7: \quad 7^2 + 2 \cdot 7 - 1 = 62 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 9: \quad 9^2 + 2 \cdot 9 - 1 = 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 11: \quad 11^2 + 2 \cdot 11 - 1 = 142 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 13: \quad 13^2 + 2 \cdot 13 - 1 = 182 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 15: \quad 15^2 + 2 \cdot 15 - 1 = 234 \equiv 11 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 17: \quad 17^2 + 2 \cdot 17 - 1 = 302 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 19: \quad 19^2 + 2 \cdot 19 - 1 = 382 \equiv 11 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t = 21: \quad 21^2 + 2 \cdot 21 - 1 = 470 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]

   where \(s\) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic foot, we have:

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes

and
\[

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)|}{|\mathbf{d}_1|}.
\]
First, we identify the direction vectors \(\mathbf{d}_1\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2\):
\[
\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.

Since \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), the lines are indeed parallel. Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get:

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height of \(\triangle ACD\) from vertex \(A\) to side \(CD\) is the same as the height \(h\) of the trapezoid. The base of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(CD\), which is equal to \(a\) because \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), making \(CD = AD = a\).

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h

To find \(a\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have the same height \(h\) and the base of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(a\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both triangles and the sum of the bases of the two triangles is \(a + b\), we can use the area relationship to find \(a\).

However, we can directly use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because the height and the base \(a\) are the same as the height and the base of the trapezoid, respectively, and the base \(a\) is half of the sum of the bases \(a + b\) due to the angle bisector property.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To find the value of the operation \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we use the definition of the operation @, which is given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

We can simplify this by canceling the \(10\) in the denominator with the \(70\) in the numerator:

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 7 \times 7 = 49

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",49,"[49, '49']",True
"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form one segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the other segment. This is given by:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]
   However, since the order of the segments does not matter, we can simply consider the number of ways to arrange 4 points in a sequence and then pair them, which is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]

2. **Determine the number of ways the segments intersect:**
   For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their rotations and reflections). There are exactly 2 such arrangements for any given set of 4 points.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (the segments intersect) divided by the total number of outcomes (all possible pairings). Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is \(2\). The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is \(1\). The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi
   \]

3. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   The problem states that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region \(A_{\text{shaded}}\) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Identify the components of the shaded area:**
   The shaded area consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area of a sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
   \]
   Therefore, the area of the sector of the larger circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{large sector}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 \cdot \theta = 2\theta
   \]
   And the area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small sector}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta
   \]
   The total area of the shaded region is the sum of these two areas:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = 2\theta + \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{5}{2}\theta
   \]

5. **Set up the equation and solve for \(\theta\):**
   We know that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{5}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Solving for \(\theta\):
   \[
   \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]

6. **Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:**
   To convert radians to degrees, we use the fact that \(\pi\) radians is \(180\) degrees. Therefore:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \cdot 180}{3} = 120

"To determine how many cylindrical measuring cups are needed to fill a spherical container, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical cup and the spherical container and then divide the volume of the spherical container by the volume of one cylindrical cup.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical measuring cup. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical measuring cup, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical container, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical measuring cups are needed to fill the spherical container, we divide the volume of the spherical container by the volume of one cylindrical measuring cup:
\[ \text{Number of cups} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical measuring cups needed to fill the spherical container is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]
Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\). Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Substituting these values into the angle addition formula, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]

Next, we use the angle subtraction formula for sine:
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]
Substituting the values we found, we get:
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]
This is a difference of squares, so we have:
\[
(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2\sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

Therefore,
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{9}{100} = 0.09.

1. Convert the speed from ""ropes per minute"" to ""ropes per second.""
2. Convert the speed from ""ropes per second"" to ""inches per second.""

First, we know that there are 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the speed in ""ropes per second"" is:
\[ \text{Speed in ropes per second} = \frac{20 \text{ ropes per minute}}{60 \text{ seconds per minute}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ ropes per second} \]

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with all members from the same party:**
   - The number of ways to choose 5 members all from the Republicans is \( \binom{8}{5} \):
     \[
     \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

   - The number of ways to choose 5 members all from the Democrats is \( \binom{6}{5} \):

2. **Average of the integers**: The average of the three integers is:
   \[

"To find the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64

This gives us two possible equations:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

1. **Define the angles:**
   Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

2. **Use the tangent function:**
   Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the height, we have:
   \[
   \tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11}
   \]
   and
   \[
   \tan \left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{BM}{1}
   \]
   because \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

3. **Express \(\tan \left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right)\) in terms of \(\tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\):**
   Using the triple angle identity for tangent, we have:

   \tan \left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{3\tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - \tan^3 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{1 - 3\tan^2 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}

   Setting this equal to \(\frac{BM}{1}\) and \(\tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{BM}{11}\), we get:
   \[
   \frac{3 \cdot \frac{BM}{11} - \left(\frac{BM}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{BM}{11}\right)^2} = BM

   Simplifying, we have:
   \[
   \frac{3 \cdot \frac{BM}{11} - \frac{BM^3}{1331}}{1 - 3 \cdot \frac{BM^2}{121}} = BM

   \[
   \frac{33BM - \frac{BM^3}{1331}}{121 - 3BM^2} = BM

   Multiplying both sides by \(121 - 3BM^2\), we get:

   33BM - \frac{BM^3}{1331} = BM(121 - 3BM^2)
   \]
   \[
   33BM - \frac{BM^3}{1331} = 121BM - 3BM^3

   Rearranging terms, we have:

   3BM^3 - \frac{BM^3}{1331} = 88BM

   \[
   \frac{3993BM^3 - BM^3}{1331} = 88BM

   Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we have:
   \[
   BC = 2BM = 2 \cdot 5.42 = 10.84

Let the 27 consecutive integers be \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\). The sum of these integers can be expressed as:

\[

\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, 3)\). Thus, the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, define \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[-4 < y^2 + 4y.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The root of the equation \((y + 2)^2 = 0\) is \(y = -2\). This root divides the real number line into two intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\) and \((-2, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -2)\), choose \(y = -3\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-3 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((- \infty, -2)\).

2. For \(y \in (-2, \infty)\), choose \(y = -1\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-1 + 2)^2 = (1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-2, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) is \((-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, \infty)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, \infty)\). Thus, the solution to \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is:
\[x \in \mathbb{R}.\]

Finally, we find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and properties of symmetric polynomials.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given that \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we can solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[-8 + 36 = \frac{1728}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[28 = \frac{1728}{p^3}.\]
Solving for \(p^3\), we get
\[p^3 = \frac{1728}{28} = \frac{432}{7}.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

However, we need to check if this value is consistent with the original equations. Instead, we can use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try to find a simpler solution. By trial and error or further algebraic manipulation, we find that \(p = 6\) is a solution that satisfies both equations.

"To determine for which class the number of male students who took the bus is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female students who took the bus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of male students who took the bus for each class.
2. Calculate the number of female students who took the bus for each class.
3. Calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female students who took the bus for each class.
4. Find the class for which the number of male students who took the bus is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female students who took the bus.

Let's start with the calculations:

### Class 9th
- Number of male students who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3\)
- Number of female students who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.394 = 118.2\)
- \(135\%\) of the number of female students who took the bus: \(118.2 \times 1.35 = 158.67\)

### Class 10th
- Number of male students who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2\)
- Number of female students who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3\)
- \(135\%\) of the number of female students who took the bus: \(99.3 \times 1.35 = 133.545\)

### Class 11th
- Number of male students who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8\)
- Number of female students who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4\)
- \(135\%\) of the number of female students who took the bus: \(41.4 \times 1.35 = 55.99\)

### Class 12th
- Number of male students who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8\)
- Number of female students who took the bus: \(300 \times 0.086 = 25.8\)
- \(135\%\) of the number of female students who took the bus: \(25.8 \times 1.35 = 34.83\)

Now, we compare the number of male students who took the bus to \(135\%\) of the number of female students who took the bus for each class:

- Class 9th: \(123.3\) vs \(158.67\) (difference: \(35.37\))

- Class 12th: \(34.8\) vs \(34.83\) (difference: \(0.03\))

The smallest difference is for Class 12th, which is \(0.03\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the denominator in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

In boxed form, the answer is:

"To find the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we need to consider the given information about the perimeter of the field and the circular segments. The perimeter of the field consists of two straight sides and two semicircular arcs. The total perimeter is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangular field by \( L \) meters and the width by \( W \) meters. The two semicircular arcs together form a full circle with a radius equal to the width \( W \) of the rectangle. The circumference of this circle is \( 2\pi W \).

The perimeter of the field can be expressed as the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle:
\[
2L + 2\pi W = 400
\]
We can simplify this equation to:
\[
L + \pi W = 200
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:
\[
L = 200 - \pi W
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \cdot W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = (200 - \pi W)W = 200W - \pi W^2
\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( W \), and it represents a downward-opening parabola. The maximum area occurs at the vertex of this parabola. The vertex form for a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -\pi \) and \( b = 200 \), so:
\[
W = -\frac{200}{2(-\pi)} = \frac{200}{2\pi} = \frac{100}{\pi}
\]
Substituting \( W = \frac{100}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \), we get:
\[
L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 100 = 100
\]
Therefore, the area \( A \) of the field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). This means that the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units. Let's denote the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) as \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \(x\):

\[
x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
\]
\[
x^2 + 4 = 25
\]
\[
x^2 = 21

\[
x = \sqrt{21}

So, the sides of the triangle are \(RT = 5\), \(RS = \sqrt{21}\), and \(ST = 2\). Since \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), angle \(T\) is complementary to angle \(R\). Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\).

The cosine of angle \(R\) is the adjacent side to angle \(R\) divided by the hypotenuse:

\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \( y \) into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root. Let \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We take the derivative of \( f(x) \) and set it to zero to find the critical points:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us three critical points: \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

The minimum distance can be expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3

   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

   Testing \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   3^3 - 2 \cdot 3^2 - 3 \cdot 3 + 6 = 27 - 18 - 9 + 6 = 6 \neq 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 3 \) is not a solution.

   Since \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) are not solutions, and there are no other rational roots to test, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 equilateral triangle faces. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given that the distances from point \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, \) and \( A_6 \), where \( A_1 \) is opposite to \( A_4 \), \( A_2 \) is opposite to \( A_5 \), and \( A_3 \) is opposite to \( A_6 \).

The key property we will use is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to \( 4a^2 \), where \( a \) is the edge length of the octahedron.

First, we need to find the edge length \( a \) of the octahedron. The distance between opposite vertices of a regular octahedron is \( a\sqrt{2} \). Since the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is constant.

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to \( A_6 \) as \( x \). Then, the sum of the squares of the distances is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 4a^2 \]

Calculating the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324 \]

So, we have:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 4a^2 \]

Since \( a\sqrt{2} \) is the distance between opposite vertices, and the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to \( 4a^2 \).

Given that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, and the sum of the squares of these distances is 324, we can find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex by solving:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 4a^2 \]

Since \( 4a^2 \) is a constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to \( 4a^2 \). Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:
\[ x = \sqrt{4a^2 - 324} \]

Given that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, and the sum of the squares of these distances is 324, we can find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex by solving:
\[ x = \sqrt{4a^2 - 324} \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to \( 4a^2 \), the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to that of the baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Given that the force applied to both the softball and the baseball is the same, we can write:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for both objects, we have:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the softball and the baseball:
\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ grams} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ grams} \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, which is:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \]

From the equation \( m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \), we can solve for \( a_{\text{softball}} \) in terms of \( a_{\text{baseball}} \):

\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{softball}}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Substituting the given masses, we get:

\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{150}{200} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

"To determine how many common digits are in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Identify common digits
Now, we compare the digits in the base 7 representation \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation \(1165_8\).

The digits in \(1556_7\) are: \(1, 5, 6\)

The digits in \(1165_8\) are: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are: \(1, 5, 6\)

There are 3 common digits.

Thus, the number of common digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the number of handshakes that occurred in the meeting, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 6 women and 10 men at the meeting.
2. Each woman shakes hands with each man, but no woman shakes hands with another woman, and no man shakes hands with another man.

Since each of the 6 women shakes hands with each of the 10 men, the total number of handshakes is calculated by multiplying the number of women by the number of men. This is because each woman has 10 handshakes (one with each man), and there are 6 women, so the total number of handshakes is:

\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of handshakes that occurred in the meeting is \(\boxed{60}\).","[60, '60']",60,"[60, '60']",True
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2.

Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can express \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Notice that:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product, we get:
\[

\]

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and can be expressed in terms of complex numbers. The roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) are:
\[
\alpha_1 = -1 + i, \quad \alpha_2 = -1 - i, \quad \alpha_3 = 1 + i, \quad \alpha_4 = 1 - i.
\]

Now, we can calculate \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\):
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = (-1 + i)(-1 - i) + (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = (-1 + i)(1 + i) + (-1 - i)(1 - i) = -1 - 1 + i - i - 1 - 1 - i + i = -4,

\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = (-1 + i)(1 - i) + (-1 - i)(1 + i) = -1 + 1 - i + i - 1 + 1 + i - i = 0.
\]

Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

Let \( x \) be the cost of one orange in dollars and \( y \) be the cost of one grape in dollars. The problem states that three oranges and one grape cost \$1.24, and five oranges and one grape cost \$1.82. We can express these relationships with the following equations:

\[ 3x + y = 1.24 \]
\[ 5x + y = 1.82 \]

To eliminate \( y \), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 2x = 0.58 \]
\[ x = 0.29 \]

Since \( x \) is the cost of one orange in dollars, we convert this amount to cents by multiplying by 100:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Assume \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region inside the rectangle where \(d_O < d_A\), \(d_O < d_B\), \(d_O < d_C\), and \(d_O < d_D\). Let's start with the inequality \(d_O < d_A\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These four inequalities define a smaller rectangle inside the original rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\) and side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{smaller rectangle}} = \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\right) \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original rectangle}} = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{smaller rectangle}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original rectangle}}} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{16a^2b^2}

Given that \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \), we have \( \frac{2a}{2b} = k \) or \( \frac{a}{b} = k \). Therefore, \( a = kb \). Substituting \( a = kb \) into the probability expression, we get:

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Total amount in dollars:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 = 126.60 \]

**Step 2: Convert the total amount into cents.**

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:

**Step 3: Determine the maximum amount that can be converted into bills.**

The maximum amount that can be converted into bills is the largest whole number less than or equal to 126.60 dollars, which is 126 dollars. Converting this into cents:

"To find the average (arithmetic mean) of the class's scores, we need to follow these steps:

- 20 students received a score of 80. So, the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- 8 students received a score of 90. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students received a score of 100. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these scores to get the total score for the entire class:

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[

\]

### Step 5: Calculate the sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n-9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[

The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals must be equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, let's solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the other equation \( 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \):
\[
2(7) + 1 = 4(7) - 13 \implies 14 + 1 = 28 - 13 \implies 15 = 15

\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}

2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest path that visits all four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once, we need to consider all possible permutations of the points and calculate the total distance for each permutation. The distances between the points are given as follows:

- \(AB = 6\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will evaluate the total distance for each permutation of the points starting and ending at any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

### Permutation 1: \(A \to B \to C \to D \to A\)
The total distance is:
\[AB + BC + CD + DA = 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20\]

### Permutation 2: \(A \to B \to D \to C \to A\)
The total distance is:
\[AB + BD + DC + CA = 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19\]

### Permutation 3: \(A \to C \to B \to D \to A\)
The total distance is:
\[AC + CB + BD + DA = 6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 19\]

### Permutation 4: \(A \to C \to D \to B \to A\)
The total distance is:
\[AC + CD + DB + BA = 6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19\]

### Permutation 5: \(A \to D \to B \to C \to A\)
The total distance is:
\[AD + DB + BC + CA = 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19\]

### Permutation 6: \(A \to D \to C \to B \to A\)
The total distance is:
\[AD + DC + CB + BA = 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20\]

From the above calculations, the shortest path is 19. Therefore, the shortest path that visits all four points exactly once is \(\boxed{19}\).","[19, '19']",13,"[13, '13']",False
