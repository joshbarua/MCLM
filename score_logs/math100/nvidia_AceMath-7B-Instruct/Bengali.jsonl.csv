"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \),
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{6i}{2} + i^2\frac{6i}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within their block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit in any order. The number of ways to arrange 3 people in a line is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the arrangements**: To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units around the table by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the exponent of \(x\) in the term is zero (since a constant term has no \(x\)). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100 x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6} = -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6}
\]

Combining these, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100 x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot x^6 \cdot \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7. Let's substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression and simplify step by step.

First, we substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = ((7k + 2) + 2)((7k + 2) + 4)((7k + 2) + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).
\]

Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

So, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7 becomes:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, we calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24,
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3.
\]

So, the remainder is 3. Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

"To find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. So, we need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   We can factorize the quadratic expression as follows:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Therefore, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   So, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Here, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

   So, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Here, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,
   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Hence, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1.

2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\]

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

"Let's denote the weight of one tricycle as \( T \), the weight of one square as \( S \), and the weight of one golf ball as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. The weight of ten tricycles is equal to the weight of three squares and one golf ball:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. The weight of two tricycles and one golf ball is equal to the weight of one square:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find how many tricycles have the same weight as one square. To do this, we will express \( S \) in terms of \( T \) and \( G \) using the second equation, and then substitute this expression into the first equation.

From the second equation, we can solve for \( S \):
\[
S = 2T + G
\]

Now substitute \( S = 2T + G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3(2T + G) + G

\[
10T = 6T + 3G + G
\]
\[

\[

\[
T = G

Now that we know \( T = G \), we can substitute \( G = T \) back into the expression for \( S \):
\[
S = 2T + T

\[

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by multiplying the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) and then comparing the resulting polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare this polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By comparing the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step. From the fourth equation, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation and solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the second equation to verify:

\[

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.

\]

### Case 1: \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on \(x \geq a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) is decreasing and can take any value from \(-\infty\) to \(a^3\).

### Case 2: \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is increasing and can take any value from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is decreasing and can take any value from \(\infty\) to \(a^2\).

### Combining Both Cases
To ensure that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of \(f(x)\) in both cases.

- If \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) is \([a^3, \infty)\) for \(x \geq a\) and \((-\infty, \infty)\) for \(x < a\). Therefore, the overall range is \([a^3, \infty) \cup (-\infty, \infty) = (-\infty, \infty)\), which means every horizontal line is intersected.
- If \(a < 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\) for \(x \geq a\) and \([a^2, \infty)\) for \(x < a\). Therefore, the overall range is \((-\infty, a^3] \cup [a^2, \infty)\). For the graph to intersect every horizontal line, the range must be \((-\infty, \infty)\), which means \(a^3 \geq a^2\). Since \(a < 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a^2\) (which is positive) to get \(a \geq 1\). However, this is a contradiction because \(a < 0\). Therefore, there is no negative value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition.

Thus, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 0\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.

Rearranging terms, we have:

This gives us two solutions:

x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) \implies x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) \implies x(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\)
2. \(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0\).

The first case \(x = 0\) corresponds to the fixed point \(x = 0\). We need to consider the second case:
\[
1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Let's test the boundary values of \(x\):
- If \(x = 1\), then \(\lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda \cdot 1 + \lambda \cdot 1^2) = 0 \neq 1\). So, \(x = 1\) is not a solution.
- If \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = x\). So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, not a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Therefore, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\) has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the function and its behavior, we find that this equation has a solution for \(2 < \lambda \le 4\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the solution is \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), and for \(\lambda = 4\), the solution is \(x = \frac{1}{2}\).

Thus, the values of \(\lambda\) are:

"To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which the given expression holds, we start by simplifying the given expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine. Recall that:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these identities, we can rewrite the numerator and the denominator of the given expression.

The numerator is:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

This can be grouped as:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

This can be grouped as:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula, we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We now use the tangent addition formula \(\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\). Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we can rewrite it as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities:

\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]

we get:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is:

\[

"The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 7 letters: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Here, the letter 'E' appears twice and the letter 'L' appears twice.

To find the number of ways to arrange these letters, we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times \ldots \times n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

In this case:
- Total letters \( n = 7 \)
- Frequency of 'E' \( n_1 = 2 \)
- Frequency of 'L' \( n_2 = 2 \)
- Frequency of 'I' \( n_3 = 1 \)
- Frequency of 'P' \( n_4 = 1 \)
- Frequency of 'S' \( n_5 = 1 \)

Now, we can calculate the number of arrangements:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{7!}{2! \times 2!}
\]

Calculating \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Calculating \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

Now substituting back into the formula:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{5040}{2 \times 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the product.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

Calculating each term:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since all higher powers of 5 will result in fractions less than 1, their integer parts will be 0. Therefore, we sum the values:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product, i.e., \(\frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v}\|\).

Here, \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
So, the cross product is \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"To find the area of triangle \(ENG\), we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \(G\) of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that \(G\) is the centroid, the line segment \(MN\) parallel to \(BC\) and passing through \(G\) divides triangle \(ABC\) into two regions: a smaller triangle \(AMN\) and a trapezoid \(MNCB\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, triangle \(AMN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(2:3\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(AMN\) is:

The area of trapezoid \(MNCB\) is the remaining part of triangle \(ABC\):

Given that the fourth term \( a_4 = 200 \) and the eighth term \( a_8 = 500 \), we can set up the following equations:

1. For the fourth term:
\[
a + 3d = 200 \quad \text{(1)}

2. For the eighth term:

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use the properties of the sine function and symmetry. First, we note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). We can use this identity to find the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\):

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Therefore, the original expression becomes:

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

So, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we find:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

"To find the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the condition:

\[ (t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2 modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the values from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), the possible values are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). However, 4 is even, so the only solution is:

1. Calculate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from \( f(5) \).

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]

Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
2 \frac{x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

Thus, the solutions to the equation are

x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the properties of the cross product. The cross product is distributive over vector addition, so we can expand the expression as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are no restrictions on the order in which they are chosen. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the points is simply the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24

2. **Determine the number of ways in which the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect:**
   For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their rotations and reflections).

   There are 2 possible alternating patterns for any given arrangement of the points. Since there are \(4!\) total arrangements of the points, and half of these arrangements will result in intersecting line segments, we have:

The total area of the shaded regions is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the total area of the shaded regions is:

\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:

The total area of the shaded regions is the sum of these two areas:
\[

Now, to find out how many conical vessels are required to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one conical vessel:
\[ \text{Number of conical vessels} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cone}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{24 \pi} = \frac{288}{24} = 12 \]

"To solve the problem of forming a 5-member committee from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that each party must have at least one member in the committee, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Ways to Choose 5 Members**: First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats) without any restrictions. This can be calculated using the combination formula:

   \[
   \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
   \]

   Here, \( n = 14 \) and \( k = 5 \):

   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!}
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = 2002
   \]

2. **Ways to Choose 5 Members with No Republicans**: Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members from only the Democrats (6 Democrats). This is given by:

   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = 6
   \]

3. **Ways to Choose 5 Members with No Democrats**: Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members from only the Republicans (8 Republicans):

   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56
   \]

4. **Applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**: To find the number of valid committees where at least one member from each party is included, we subtract the cases where one party is entirely excluded from the total number of committees:

   \[
   \text{Valid Committees} = \text{Total Ways} - \text{Ways with No Republicans} - \text{Ways with No Democrats}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Valid Committees} = 2002 - 6 - 56 = 1940

   \]

2. **Finding the average of the integers:**
   The average of the three integers is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

Solving the first equation:

\[

Solving the second equation:

\[

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), where \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\). We are also given that \(D\) is a point on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\).

Given that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), we can use the fact that \(D\) lies on the altitude \(AM\). The key property here is that \(\angle BDC\) is the external angle to \(\triangle BDM\) and \(\triangleCDM\), and it is equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles. Therefore, \(\angle BDC = \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ - \theta\).

However, we are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), so we have:
\[3\theta = 180^\circ - \theta\]
\[4\theta = 180^\circ\]
\[\theta = 45^\circ\]

Thus, \(\angle BAC = 45^\circ\), and \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 67.5^\circ\).

Now, since \(\angle BAC = 45^\circ\), triangle \(ABC\) is a right isosceles triangle with \(AB = AC\) and \(\angle BAC = 90^\circ\). The altitude \(AM\) is the median to the hypotenuse \(BC\), and it is also the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Therefore, \(AM = \frac{BC}{2}\).

Given \(AM = 11\), we have:
\[BC = 2 \times 11 = 22\]

In a right isosceles triangle, the legs \(AB\) and \(AC\) are equal, and they can be found using the relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse:
\[AB = AC = \frac{BC}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{22}{\sqrt{2}} = 11\sqrt{2}\]

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is the sum of the lengths of its sides:
\[AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{2} + 11\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22\sqrt{2} + 22\]

Thus, the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we discard the part of the interval where \(y < 0\). Thus, the solution in terms of \(x\) is:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
So, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is \((- \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, define \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[-4 < y^2 + 4y.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The root of the equation \((y + 2)^2 = 0\) is \(y = -2\). This root divides the real number line into two intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\) and \((-2, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -2)\), choose \(y = -3\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-3 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((- \infty, -2)\).

2. For \(y \in (-2, \infty)\), choose \(y = -1\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-1 + 2)^2 = (1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-2, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) is \((-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, \infty)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we discard the part of the interval where \(y < 0\). Thus, the solution in terms of \(x\) is:
\[x^2 > 0.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[x \neq 0.\]
So, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is \((-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)\).

Finally, we find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities:
\[
(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}) \cap ((-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)) = (-\sqrt{3}, 0) \cup (0, \sqrt{3}).

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use the identity for the sum of cubes and some algebraic manipulation.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this expression in terms of symmetric sums:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the equation, we get:
\[12 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[24 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
\[24 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p) = s(s^2 - 4p),\]
\[24 = sp.\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right) = \frac{24}{p} \left(\frac{576}{p^2} - 4p\right) = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 4p^3}{p^2} = \frac{24(576 - 4p^3)}{p^3}.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[-8 = \frac{13824 - 96p^3}{p^3},\]
\[-8p^3 = 13824 - 96p^3,\]
\[88p^3 = 13824,\]
\[p^3 = \frac{13824}{88} = 156.81818181818182,\]

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero.

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the denominator in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

This property is a generalization of the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular polygon is constant.

Given that the distances from point \( P \) to five of the vertices of the regular octagon are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's denote the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the octagon as \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6, d_7, \) and \( d_8 \). According to the property of the regular octagon, the sum of the squares of these distances is constant. Therefore, we have:

Let's calculate the sum of the squares of these distances:

\[ d_1^2 = 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ d_2^2 = 7^2 = 49 \]
\[ d_3^2 = 8^2 = 64 \]
\[ d_4^2 = 9^2 = 81 \]
\[ d_5^2 = 11^2 = 121 \]

Adding these values together, we get:

\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324 \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all eight vertices is constant, we have:

\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2 = 324 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2 \]

However, we only need to find the distance to the sixth vertex, \( d_6 \). The sum of the squares of the distances to the other three vertices, \( d_7 \) and \( d_8 \), must be such that the total sum remains constant. Since the sum of the squares of the distances to the other three vertices is not specified, we can assume that the sum of the squares of the distances to the sixth vertex is the remaining part of the constant sum after subtracting the sum of the squares of the known distances.

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

\[ d_6 = \sqrt{324 - (d_7^2 + d_8^2)} \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances to the other three vertices is not specified, we can assume that the sum of the squares of the distances to the sixth vertex is the remaining part of the constant sum after subtracting the sum of the squares of the known distances.

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

\[ d_6 = \sqrt{324 - 324} = 0 \]

However, this is not possible since the distance cannot be zero. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octagon to the vertices is constant and that the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices of a regular octagon.

The correct distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

\[ d_6 = \sqrt{324 - 324} = 0 \]

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine how many digits are the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:

- Base 7: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The digits that are the same in both representations are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\). There are 3 such digits.

Thus, the number of digits that are the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

First, we find the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We use the identity for the product of sums of products of roots:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Expanding this product is quite complex, so we use another approach. We know that \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial whose coefficients are symmetric functions of \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). From Vieta's formulas, we can deduce that the polynomial is \(t^3 + 4t + 4 = 0\). Therefore, the roots of this polynomial are \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\).

We solve the polynomial \(t^3 + 4t + 4 = 0\) using the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4\). Testing these, we find:
\[
t = -2 \implies (-2)^3 + 4(-2) + 4 = -8 - 8 + 4 = -12 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = -1 \implies (-1)^3 + 4(-1) + 4 = -1 - 4 + 4 = -1 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = 1 \implies 1^3 + 4(1) + 4 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = 2 \implies 2^3 + 4(2) + 4 = 8 + 8 + 4 = 20 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = -4 \implies (-4)^3 + 4(-4) + 4 = -64 - 16 + 4 = -76 \neq 0,
\]
\[
t = 4 \implies 4^3 + 4(4) + 4 = 64 + 16 + 4 = 84 \neq 0.
\]
Since none of the rational roots work, we conclude that the roots are not rational. However, we know they are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 + 4t + 4 = 0\), which has three distinct roots. Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Assume the center \(O\) is at the origin \((0,0)\), and the vertices are \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). Given that the ratio of the length to the width of the rectangle is \(k\), we have \(a = k \cdot b\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

For the point \((x, y)\) to be closer to the center \(O\) than to vertex \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other vertices:
- For vertex \(B = (a, b)\):
  \[
  ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
  \]
- For vertex \(C = (a, -b)\):
  \[
  ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
  \]
- For vertex \(D = (-a, -b)\):
  \[
  ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
  \]

These inequalities describe a smaller rectangle inside the original rectangle \(ABCD\) with the same center \(O\) and sides parallel to the original rectangle. The side lengths of this smaller rectangle are half the side lengths of the original rectangle, so the area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\left(\frac{a}{2}\right) \left(\frac{b}{2}\right) = \frac{ab}{4}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\frac{\frac{ab}{4}}{ab} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the second row equal to the sum of the first row:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
