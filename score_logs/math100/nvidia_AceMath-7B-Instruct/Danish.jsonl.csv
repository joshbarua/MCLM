"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by using the given information that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of \(EF\) is 7 units. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:

\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this triangle, we have:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplifying the squares, we have:

\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To isolate \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:

\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) and \( c \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.**
2. **Rotate the translated \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise.**
3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.**

Let's start with the first step. The complex number \( z \) is \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and the complex number \( c \) is \( 2 - 3i \). To translate \( z \) and \( c \) so that \( c \) is at the origin, we subtract \( c \) from \( z \):

\[
z - c = \left( (2 + \sqrt{2}) - 2 \right) + \left( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (-3) \right)i = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
\]

Next, we rotate the complex number \( \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise. The rotation of a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise is given by multiplying it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), so:

\[
e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

We multiply \( \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

\[
\left( \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
\]

First, we expand \( \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \):

\[
\sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i
\]

Next, we expand \( -(3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \):

\[
-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = -(3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -(3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i^2
\]

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:

\[
-(3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (-1) = -(3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i + (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i
\]

Combining the real and imaginary parts, we get:

\[
1 + i + (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i = 1 + \frac{(3 + 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( 1 - \frac{(3 + 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) i
\]

Simplifying the real part:

\[
1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 = 4 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Simplifying the imaginary part:

\[
1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} = 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 = -2 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

So, the rotated complex number is:

\[
4 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - \left( 2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) i
\]

Finally, we translate this complex number back to the original coordinate system by adding \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\[
\left( 4 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2 \right) + \left( - \left( 2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - (-3) \right)i = \left( 2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)i
\]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Combining these results, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

4. Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization. We know that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block, which is \(3! = 6\).

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

\[
= \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot x^{-6}

\[

\[

\[

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each factor modulo 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder of 4 when divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder of 6 when divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder of 8 when divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, find the remainder of 24 when divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,

so

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise around its center to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

Here are the steps to find the answer:

1. Identify the total degrees in a full rotation: \(360^\circ\).
2. Determine the number of sides of the pentagon: 5.
3. Calculate the angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself by dividing the full rotation by the number of sides: \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means there must be another possible configuration for the parallelogram. Let's consider the other diagonal, connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\), and the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, this does not satisfy \(x > 7\). Let's consider the last possible configuration, where the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\) is parallel to the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\), and the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is parallel to the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\).

The vector from \((5, 3)\) to \((7, 4)\) is \((2, 1)\). The vector from \((6, 8)\) to \((x, y)\) must be the same, so:
\[
(x-6, y-8) = (2, 1) \implies x-6 = 2 \implies x = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad y-8 = 1 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). This satisfies \(x > 7\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine.

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   We can factorize the quadratic expression as follows:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   Let \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

   Let \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[9 + 8 = 17.\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36.\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the weights of the treeks, squigs, and goolees. Let's define the weights as follows:
- Let the weight of one treek be \( T \).
- Let the weight of one squig be \( S \).
- Let the weight of one goolee be \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The weight of three treeks and one goolee is equal to the weight of three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   3T + G = 3S + G
   \]
   By subtracting \( G \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   3T = 3S
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
   \[
   T = S
   \]
   So, the weight of one treek is equal to the weight of one squig.

2. The weight of two treeks and one goolee is equal to the weight of one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]
   Since \( T = S \), we can substitute \( S \) for \( T \) in the equation:
   \[
   2T + G = T
   \]
   Subtracting \( T \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   T + G = 0
   \]
   Therefore, the weight of one goolee is:
   \[
   G = -T
   \]
   Since \( T = S \), we can also write:
   \[
   G = -S
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many treeks have the same weight as one squig. Since the weight of one treek is equal to the weight of one squig, the number of treeks that have the same weight as one squig is:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of the resulting polynomial with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\):
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\):
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\):
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

   This is true.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), which must equal \(6\):
   \[

Since all the coefficients match, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank multiplied by the height of the water added per hour. The cross-sectional area of the tank is \( \pi r^2 \), and the height of the water added per hour is 4 meters. Therefore, the volume of water added per hour can also be expressed as:

\[ \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

Since the volume of water added per hour is given as \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \pi r^2 \cdot 4 = 20\pi \]

To solve for \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):

\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) defined piecewise:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first piece \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x \geq a \).
2. **Behavior**: This is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).
3. **Minimum/Maximum**: 
   - If \( a > 0 \), the minimum value occurs at \( x = a \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]
   - If \( a < 0 \), the maximum value occurs at \( x = a \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]

### Step 2: Analyze the second piece \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x < a \).
2. **Behavior**: This is a linear function.
3. **Slope**: The slope is \( a \).
   - If \( a > 0 \), the function is increasing.
   - If \( a < 0 \), the function is decreasing.

### Step 3: Determine the range of \( f(x) \)

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - The parabola \( ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \) has a minimum value of \( a^3 \).
   - The linear function \( ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( x \) decreases.
   - Therefore, the range of \( f(x) \) is \( (-\infty, a^3] \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - The parabola \( ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \) has a maximum value of \( a^3 \).
   - The linear function \( ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \) approaches \( \infty \) as \( x \) decreases.
   - Therefore, the range of \( f(x) \) is \( [a^3, \infty) \).

### Step 4: Ensure intersection with every horizontal line

For \( f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range must cover all real numbers. This is only possible if \( a^3 \) is the only critical point and it is either the minimum or maximum.

### Step 5: Find the largest \( a \)

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**: The range is \( (-\infty, a^3] \). This does not cover all real numbers.
2. **For \( a < 0 \)**: The range is \( [a^3, \infty) \). This does not cover all real numbers either.

### Conclusion

The only way for \( f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line at least once is if \( a = 0 \). In this case, the function simplifies to:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x \geq 0,\\
0 & \text{if } x < 0.

\]

This function is constant and intersects every horizontal line at least once.

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\), so \(y\) must be a fixed point of \(f\). Therefore, \(y\) can be either 0 or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

We consider two cases:

1. \(y = 0\):
   \[
   f(x) = 0 \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = 0 \implies x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1.
   \]
   For \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), we have \(f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0\) or \(f(f(x)) = f(1) = 0\), respectively. In both cases, \(f(f(x)) = x\) if \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), but \(f(x) = x\) for these values. Therefore, \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\) are not solutions.

2. \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\):
   \[
   f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda^2 x(1 - x) = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
   \]
   This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
   \[
   \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
   \]
   The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative for \(x\) to be real:
   \[
   \Delta = (-\lambda^2)^2 - 4(\lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) = \lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2 = \lambda^2(\lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 4) = \lambda^2(\lambda - 2)^2.
   \]
   Since \(\lambda^2 \geq 0\) and \((\lambda - 2)^2 \geq 0\), the discriminant is always non-negative. Therefore, the quadratic equation always has real solutions.

   We need to ensure that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) be the solutions to the quadratic equation. Then \(f(x_1) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) and \(f(x_2) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). We need to check if \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = x_1\) or \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = x_2\).

   Calculating \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\):
   \[
   f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
   \]
   Therefore, \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), which means \(f(f(x)) = x\) if \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) if \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \neq 0\) and \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). This is true for \(\lambda \neq 1\).

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we can further simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression matches the tangent of a specific angle. By trial and error or using a calculator, we find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.

Therefore, the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) is:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S is 1 each.

Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

\[

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle formed by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) is half the magnitude of the cross product of these vectors. The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant as follows:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]

So, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

The magnitude of the cross product is:

\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and thus the given equation becomes:

\[
e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta).
\]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, we can deduce that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of these two numbers and then identify which of these factors are two-digit numbers.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. Therefore, the common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of the product of the lowest powers of these common prime factors:

"To determine how many five-cent coins Hillary has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( x \) be the number of one-cent coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of ten-cent coins.
- Let \( z \) be the number of five-cent coins.

According to the problem, the total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since one-cent coins are worth 1 cent each, ten-cent coins are worth 10 cents each, and five-cent coins are worth 5 cents each, we can write the following equation:

\[ 1x + 10y + 5z = 75 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x + 10y + 5z = 75 \]

We need to find the value of \( z \). To do this, we need to consider that \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative integers. Let's isolate \( z \):

\[ z = \frac{75 - x - 10y}{5} \]

For \( z \) to be an integer, the expression \( 75 - x - 10y \) must be divisible by 5. Since 75 is divisible by 5 and 10y is divisible by 5, \( x \) must also be divisible by 5. Therefore, \( x \) can be 0, 5, 10, 15, etc.

Let's test some values for \( y \) and see if we can find a valid \( z \):

1. If \( y = 0 \):
   \[ z = \frac{75 - x}{5} \]
   - If \( x = 0 \), then \( z = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \).
   - If \( x = 5 \), then \( z = \frac{70}{5} = 14 \).
   - If \( x = 10 \), then \( z = \frac{65}{5} = 13 \).
   - And so on...

2. If \( y = 1 \):
   \[ z = \frac{65 - x}{5} \]
   - If \( x = 0 \), then \( z = \frac{65}{5} = 13 \).
   - If \( x = 5 \), then \( z = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \).
   - If \( x = 10 \), then \( z = \frac{55}{5} = 11 \).
   - And so on...

3. If \( y = 2 \):
   \[ z = \frac{55 - x}{5} \]
   - If \( x = 0 \), then \( z = \frac{55}{5} = 11 \).
   - If \( x = 5 \), then \( z = \frac{50}{5} = 10 \).
   - If \( x = 10 \), then \( z = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \).
   - And so on...

We can see that \( z \) can take various values depending on the values of \( x \) and \( y \). However, the problem does not specify the exact number of one-cent and ten-cent coins, so we can only determine the maximum possible value of \( z \) when \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0 or 2. Since we are only allowed to use the digits 0 and 1, the last digit of our number must be 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since we are only allowed to use the digits 0 and 1, the last two digits of our number must be 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since our number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, the number must contain exactly 9 ones.

   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - The first number determines the column on the chessboard, and the second number determines the row on the chessboard.

\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\).

The relationship between cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) and Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) is given by:
\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the properties of the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying, we get:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles except one:**
   If we exclude one interior angle, the sum of the remaining interior angles is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(one interior angle)}
   \]
   We know this sum is \(1070^\circ\). Let's denote the excluded interior angle by \(x\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Determine the range of the excluded interior angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the excluded interior angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < x < 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Find the range for \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):**
   By adding \(x\) to both sides of the equation, we get:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Since \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\), it follows that:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \(n\):**
   Divide the entire inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444

   Since \(n-2\) must be an integer, we have:

   n-2 = 6

The number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique even integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence equation \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find this square root:
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]
Since we are looking for the unique even integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we check which of these solutions is even. The number 4 is even, and the number 17 is odd. Therefore, the unique even integer \( t \) is:

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes

\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula

\[

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we compute \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

Simplifying the components, we get:

Now, we compute the magnitude of this vector:

   The rectangle extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). Therefore, the width of the rectangle is \(5 - (-5) = 10\) and the height is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}\). Applying this property, we get

\[

- **France**: 12 stamps, each costing 6 cents.
- **Peru**: 6 stamps, each costing 4 cents.

- Total cost for France: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents.
- Total cost for Peru: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cents.

[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we need to use the information that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the base \(a\) of \(\triangle ACD\) is part of the base \(a + b\) of the trapezoid. However, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because the height \(h\) is the same and the base \(a\) is part of the total base \(a + b\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are in the ratio of their bases \(b\) and \(a\). However, we can use the fact that the total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\), and since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to be one pair (the other two points will automatically form the other pair). This is given by:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]
   However, since the order of the pairs does not matter, we divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
   So, there are 3 ways to pair the points into two segments.

2. **Determine the number of ways the segments can intersect:**
   For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we list the points in order around the circle, they must be in one of the following orders: \(ACBD\), \(ADBC\), \(BACD\), \(BDAC\), \(CABD\), \(CBDA\), \(DABC\), or \(DBCA\). Out of these 8 possible orders, only 2 will result in intersecting segments: \(ACBD\) and \(ADBC\). Therefore, there are 2 ways for the segments to intersect.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of ways they can intersect divided by the total number of ways to pair the points:
   \[

"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the shaded regions. The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The total area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle with the same central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of these two areas:
\[
2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}

"To determine how many cylindrical containers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical container and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical tank to the volume of one cylindrical container.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical container, \( r = 3 \) cm and \( h = 8 \) cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, \( r = 6 \) cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical containers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical container:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical containers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, the expression becomes \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B)
\]

Notice that this is a product of the form \((x + y)(x - y)\), which simplifies to \(x^2 - y^2\). Here, \(x = \sin A \cos B\) and \(y = \cos A \sin B\), so we have:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B) = (\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

Now, we substitute these values into the expression:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists entirely of members from one party.

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 Republicans and 6 Democrats):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that consists entirely of Republicans:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that consists entirely of Democrats:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Now, add the number of ways to form a subcommittee entirely of Republicans and entirely of Democrats:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62

Finally, subtract this sum from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members to get the number of ways to form a subcommittee with at least one member from each party:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we know that the product of these three integers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1.\]
So, we can write another equation:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24.\]
Since \(x+1 \neq 0\), we can cancel \(x+1\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[x(x+2) = 24.\]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[x^2 + 2x = 24.\]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0.\]
We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-24\) and add up to \(2\). These numbers are \(6\) and \(-4\). Therefore, we can write:
\[(x + 6)(x - 4) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[

"To find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties. We know that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\). Point \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta\).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Place \(M\) at the origin \((0,0)\), so \(A\) is at \((0,11)\). Let \(B\) be at \((-x,0)\) and \(C\) be at \((x,0)\). Since \(AB = AC\), we have:
\[
AB = \sqrt{x^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}
\]
\[
AC = \sqrt{x^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}
\]
Thus, \(AB = AC = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}\).

Now, point \(D\) is at \((0,1)\). We need to use the given condition \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). The tangent of \(\angle BAC\) is:
\[
\tan \angle BAC = \tan 2\theta = \frac{2\tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}
\]
The tangent of \(\angle BDC\) can be found using the coordinates of \(B\), \(D\), and \(C\):
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \left| \frac{\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x}}{1 + \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{x}} \right| = \left| \frac{0}{1 + \frac{1}{x^2}} \right| = 0
\]
However, this is incorrect because \(\angle BDC\) is not a straight line. Instead, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Using the tangent triple angle identity:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}
\]
We know that \(\tan \angle BDC = \frac{2x}{11}\) and \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\). Setting these equal and solving for \(x\) is complex, so we use the geometric properties directly.

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}
\]
Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\) and \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\), we have \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\). Using the fact that \(BD = \sqrt{x^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 100}\) and \(CD = \sqrt{x^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 100}\), we can find \(x\).

\]

The sum of 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as the product of the number of integers and their average. Let the 27 consecutive integers be \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\). The sum of these integers is:

\[
a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\), the last term \(a+26\), and the number of terms 27. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)

We know that the sum is 2187, so we set up the equation:

\[ (x^2)^2 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), we can simplify this to:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:
\[ -2 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies further to:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]
Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),

\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),

Substituting the known value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 4p).
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.

Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right),

\[

1. Calculate the number of male bus passengers for each class.
2. Calculate the number of female bus passengers for each class.
3. Determine the ratio of male bus passengers to female bus passengers for each class.
4. Find the class for which this ratio is closest to \(1.35\).

Let's start with the calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of male bus passengers for each class
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3\)
- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2\)

- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.044\)
- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.04\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (except at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but these points do not affect the sign of the inequality since they make the expression zero, not negative).

Now, let's determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Additionally, we must exclude the points where the numerator is zero, which are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but \(x = 9\) is already included in the interval \((0, 36)\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular mark, we need to analyze the given information about the running track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles at the ends. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) meters and the width by \( W \) meters. The two semicircles at the ends form a full circle with a diameter equal to the width \( W \) of the rectangle. The circumference of this circle is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):

\[

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is:
   \[
   \text{opposite} = \sin{R} \times \text{hypotenuse} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side \(ST\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \( y \) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the expression inside the square root. Let \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

The minimum distance can be expressed as \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since \( a = 10 \) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we have:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center.

However, for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is also equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the opposite vertices. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices.

Let the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex be \( x \). Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is constant, we can write:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

We can also write:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = (3^2 + 11^2) + (7^2 + 9^2) + (8^2 + x^2)

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices is equal, we can pair the distances:
\[
3^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 121 = 130
\]
\[
7^2 + 9^2 = 49 + 81 = 130

Therefore, we have:

\[
260 + 64 + x^2 = \text{constant}

\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}

Since the constant is the same, we can conclude that:

Since both Jens and Jack are applying the same force, we can set their forces equal to each other:

\[

\]

This gives us:

\[
m_{\text{Jens}} \cdot a_{\text{Jens}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}}

\[

Next, we need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jens' softball to Jack's baseball:

Now we have the two representations:

The common digits between the two sets are:

- From \(1556_7\): \(1, 5, 6\)
- From \(1165_8\): \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

"To determine the number of handshakes that took place at the meeting, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 6 witches and 10 trolls.
2. Each witch shakes hands with each troll.
3. Witches do not shake hands with each other.
4. Trolls do not shake hands with each other.

Since each of the 6 witches shakes hands with each of the 10 trolls, the total number of handshakes is calculated by multiplying the number of witches by the number of trolls. This is because each witch shakes hands with each troll exactly once.

The calculation is as follows:
\[ 6 \text{ witches} \times 10 \text{ trolls} = 60 \text{ handshakes} \]

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we can use a property of polynomials that states the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0).
\]

Now, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2.
\]

Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

First, we calculate the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we calculate the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We start by expressing \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so we use a known result for the roots of a quartic polynomial. The product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) for the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\) is given by \(d^2\). In our case, \(d = 2\), so:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2^2 = 4.
\]

Now we know that \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 4\), the polynomial simplifies to:
\[
t^3 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - 4 = 0.
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1\), we use the identity:
\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Expanding and simplifying this expression is also complex, but it can be shown that:
\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = -2.
\]

Thus, the polynomial becomes:
\[
t^3 - 2t - 4 = 0.
\]

We solve this polynomial by trying possible rational roots. Testing \(t = 2\):
\[
2^3 - 2 \cdot 2 - 4 = 8 - 4 - 4 = 0.
\]

So, \(t = 2\) is a root. We can factor \(t^3 - 2t - 4\) as:
\[
t^3 - 2t - 4 = (t - 2)(t^2 + 2t + 2).
\]

The roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 + 2t + 2 = 0\) are:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2i}{2} = -1 \pm i.
\]

Therefore, the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 2t - 4 = 0\) are \(2, -1 + i,\) and \(-1 - i\). The set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of one blyant in cents, we start by defining the variables and setting up the system of equations based on the given information. Let \( b \) be the cost of one blyant in dollars and \( v \) be the cost of one jumbo viskelæder in dollars. The problem provides us with the following two equations:

1. \( 3b + v = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5b + v = 1.82 \)

We can eliminate \( v \) by subtracting the first equation from the second:

\[
(5b + v) - (3b + v) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2b = 0.58
\]

Solving for \( b \), we get:

\[
b = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29

Since \( b \) is the cost of one blyant in dollars, we convert this to cents by multiplying by 100:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the rectangle as \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \), we have \( a = kb \).

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is the midpoint of both \(AB\) and \(CD\), and also the midpoint of both \(AD\) and \(BC\). Therefore, the coordinates of \(O\) are \((0, 0)\) if we place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(A = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\), \(B = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\), \(C = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\), and \(D = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\).

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if its distance to \(O\) is less than its distance to any vertex. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + \frac{a}{2})^2 + (y + \frac{b}{2})^2}\). For \(P\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + \frac{a}{2})^2 + (y + \frac{b}{2})^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 + by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < ax + by + \frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
\[
ax + by < -\frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
\[
ax + by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the distances to the other vertices \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\):
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]
\[
-ax + by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}

\[
-ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
2. Identify the quotient and the remainder.

First, let's do the division:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

The quotient is 9. Now, to find the remainder, we can use the relationship between the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder, which is given by:

\[ \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder} \]

In this case, the dividend is 54, the divisor is 6, and the quotient is 9. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 54 = (6 \times 9) + \text{Remainder} \]

Calculating the product of 6 and 9:

\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 54 = 54 + \text{Remainder} \]

To find the remainder, we subtract 54 from both sides of the equation:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

3. Determine how many dollars they can get by vekselting the money.
4. Calculate the remaining cents after vekselting the money.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money earned in dollars.**

Linda earned \$27.47.
Sherry earned \$35.23.
June earned \$37.37.
Connie earned \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

First, add 27.47 and 35.23:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]

Next, add 37.37 to 62.70:
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]

Finally, add 26.52 to 100.07:
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money earned is \$126.59.

**Step 2: Convert the total amount into cents.**

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many dollars they can get by vekselting the money.**

To find out how many dollars they can get, we divide the total amount in cents by 100 and take the integer part:

\left\lfloor \frac{12659}{100} \right\rfloor = 126 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining cents after vekselting the money.**

To find the remaining cents, we multiply the number of dollars by 100 and subtract this from the total amount in cents:
\[
126 \times 100 = 12600 \text{ cents}

\[
12659 - 12600 = 59 \text{ cents}

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[

"To determine how many fewer feet Jim travels compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally across the rectangular mark. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the mark).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:

d = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}

So, Jim travels 500 feet.

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
