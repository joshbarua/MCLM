"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate the complex numbers so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{6i}{2} + i^2\frac{6i}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate the complex number \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.
   \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Now, we use the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct ways to arrange 8 people in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas always sit together. We can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person,"" which reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) in a circle.

The number of distinct ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange in a circle, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 ""people"" is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of distinct ways to arrange 8 people in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" in a circle and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This gives us:

\[ 120 \times 6 = 720 \]

Thus, the number of distinct ways to arrange 8 people in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we need to identify the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero. We will use the Binomial Theorem for this purpose.

The Binomial Theorem states that:
\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]
In our case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]
Simplifying the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
Solving for \(k\), we get:
\[
k = 3
\]
Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:
\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid either. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) where \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(2\cos A\) for \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can simplify the expression by canceling \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\tan A = 2

Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
   \]

   So, the solutions are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is \( 2x \), which is zero at \( x = 0 \). Therefore, the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \).

   Thus, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

   So, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

   - If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases, so it does not have a minimum value.

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).
   - If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases and decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases.
   - If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases and increases without bound as \(x\) decreases.

To ensure that the curve \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the function must cover all real values. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

Since \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases if \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) will cover all real values if \(a > 0\). However, we need to check if there is a specific value of \(a\) that ensures the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

For \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). We need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Dividing both sides by \(a\) (since \(a > 0\)), we get:
\[ a^2 \leq a + 2. \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ a^2 - a - 2 \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ (a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The solutions to this inequality are:
\[ -1 \leq a \leq 2. \]
Since \(a > 0\), the largest value of \(a\) is \(2\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the curve \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the value of \( c \) for which the radius of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) is 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). Since \(\lambda > 0\), the inequality \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) simplifies to \(\lambda \ge 1\), and the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is always true. Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in \([0,1]\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\), and since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:
\[
f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a complex equation, so we will consider the specific case where \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). If \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then:
\[
y = f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
This means that \(y = x\), so \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, which is not what we want. Therefore, we need to consider other values of \(x\).

We will now consider the case where \(x\) is a root of the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). Then:
\[
y = f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}.
\]
We need \(f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), so:
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left(\frac{4 - \lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2 (4 - \lambda)}{16} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by 16, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (4 - \lambda) = 8 \implies 4\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 = 8 \implies \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0.
\]
We need to find the roots of this cubic equation in the interval \([0,4]\). By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8\). Testing these, we find:
\[
\lambda = 2 \implies 2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0.
\]
Therefore, \(\lambda = 2\) is a root. We can factor \(\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8\) as:
\[
\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = (\lambda - 2)(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4).
\]
The quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4 = 0\) has roots:
\[
\lambda = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}.
\]
Since \(\lambda\) must be in the interval \([0,4]\), we have:
\[
\lambda = 1 + \sqrt{5}.
\]
Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) are:
\[

"To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) in degrees for which the given equation holds, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\).

The given expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:
\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these formulas, we can rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Similarly, we can rewrite the denominator as:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]

Therefore, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is:
\[
\theta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ.

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of the number \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Since there is only 1 even number out of 6, the probability that Paul chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\), and the probability that Jesse chooses an even number is also \(\frac{1}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both choose even numbers is:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers. Since there are 5 odd numbers out of 6, the probability that Paul chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability that Jesse chooses an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both choose odd numbers is:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}
\]

To find the total probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios:
\[
\frac{1}{36} + \frac{25}{36} = \frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}
\]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is \(\boxed{\frac{13}{18}}\).","[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",True
"To find the value of \( b \) when the point \( (a, b) \) lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \) and \( a = 4 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = a = 4 \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \).
2. Solve for \( y = b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

Now, we isolate \( 2b \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Finally, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ b = \frac{0}{2} \]

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0s and 1s, we start by considering the prime factorization of 450. We have:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25. \]
A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. 

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9.

Given that the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the only way to satisfy the divisibility by 9 is if the number contains exactly 9 ones. Therefore, the number must be of the form \(11111111100\).

Let's verify that \(11111111100\) is divisible by 450:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
- The sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\), so it is divisible by 9.
- Since it ends in 0, it is divisible by 2.

Thus, \(11111111100\) is divisible by 450. Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0s and 1s is:

"To determine the probability that the pelinappula asetetaan shakkilaudan varjostetulle ruudulle, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Each pyörä pyöritetään kahdesti, joten jokaista pyörän numeron on yhtä todennäköinen.
   - There are 10 possible outcomes for each pyörä (0-9), so for two pyörät, the total number of possible outcomes is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - The first number determines the column on the chessboard, and there are 8 columns (a-h).
   - The second number determines the row on the chessboard, and there are 8 rows (1-8).
   - Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes (where the pelinappula asetetaan varjostetulle ruudulle) is \(8 \times 8 = 64\).

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   - So, the probability is \(\frac{64}{100} = \frac{16}{25}\).

"To determine the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the properties of the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

\[

Simplifying, we get:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Determine the measure of the missing interior angle:**
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Find the range for \(x\):**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < x < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Estimate the value of \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the approximate value of \(n\) by assuming \(x\) is close to the middle of its range. Let's start by solving the equation without considering the exact value of \(x\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Since \(x\) is less than \(180^\circ\), we can approximate:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ + 180^\circ = 1250^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 6.9444
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   n \approx 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we test \(n = 8\) and \(n = 9\).

6. **Check \(n = 8\):**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   The missing angle \(x\) would be:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(0^\circ < 10^\circ < 180^\circ\), \(n = 8\) is a valid solution.

7. **Check \(n = 9\):**
   If \(n = 9\), the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (9-2) \times 180^\circ = 7 \times 180^\circ = 1260^\circ
   \]
   The missing angle \(x\) would be:
   \[
   x = 1260^\circ - 1070^\circ = 190^\circ
   \]
   Since \(190^\circ\) is not less than \(180^\circ\), \(n = 9\) is not a valid solution.

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the property of modular inverses. If \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, then we have:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have two candidates: \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). The odd one is \( t = 17 \).

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

Next, we need to find \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Recall that \(\cot(\phi) = \frac{1}{\tan(\phi)}\), so \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\).

Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:

To find \(h\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\).

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{CD}\) as one of its legs. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed in terms of the segments created by the angle bisector theorem, but a simpler approach is to use the fact that the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles and the total area of the trapezoid.

Given that \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid if we consider the symmetry and the fact that the height is the same:

"To find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we use the definition of the operation @ given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

We can simplify this by canceling the \(10\) in the denominator with the \(70\) in the numerator:

\[

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose and arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the points.

Next, we need to count the number of these permutations where the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, the points must be in an alternating pattern. There are 2 possible alternating patterns for any given pair of points \(A\) and \(B\):
1. \(A, C, B, D\)
2. \(A, D, B, C\)

For each pair of points \(A\) and \(B\), there are 2 possible choices for the points \(C\) and \(D\) that will result in an intersection. Since there are \(4\) points, there are \(4\) choices for \(A\) and \(3\) choices for \(B\) (after \(A\) is chosen), giving us \(4 \times 3 = 12\) ways to choose \(A\) and \(B\). For each of these choices, there are 2 ways to choose \(C\) and \(D\) such that the chords intersect. Therefore, the total number of permutations where the chords intersect is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).

However, we have overcounted because each pair of chords is counted twice (once for each order of the points). Therefore, the correct number of permutations where the chords intersect is \(12\).

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable permutations to the total number of permutations:
\[
\frac{12}{24} = \frac{1}{2}

Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the varved area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the areas of the circles:**
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \(1\).
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\).
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\).

2. **Determine the area of the varved region:**
   - The varved area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   - Therefore, the varved area is \(\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

3. **Identify the varved region:**
   - The varved region is the area of the larger circle that is not covered by the smaller circle.
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi\).
   - The area of the varved region is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle plus the area of the overlapping sector of the smaller circle.
   - Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the smaller circle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}\).
   - Therefore, the varved area is \(4\pi - \pi + \frac{\theta}{2} = 3\pi + \frac{\theta}{2}\).

4. **Set up the equation and solve for \(\theta\):**
   - We know that the varved area is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\).
   - So, we have the equation \(3\pi + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).
   - Subtract \(3\pi\) from both sides: \(\frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} - 3\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3} - \frac{9\pi}{3} = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\).
   - Multiply both sides by 2: \(\theta = -\frac{8\pi}{3}\).

5. **Convert \(\theta\) to degrees:**
   - Since \(\theta\) is negative, we take the positive equivalent by adding \(2\pi\): \(\theta = 2\pi - \frac{8\pi}{3} = \frac{6\pi}{3} - \frac{8\pi}{3} = -\frac{2\pi}{3}\).
   - Convert \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) to degrees: \(\frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 120^\circ\).

"To determine how many cylindrical containers of water are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical container and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical container, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical containers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical container:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical containers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To convert the speed of the polkupyörä from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert feet per minute to feet per second.

Next, we know that there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, to convert the speed from feet per second to inches per second, we multiply by 12:

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee with all members from the same party.

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from 14 members (8 republicans and 6 democrats):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with all members from the same party. There are two cases to consider: all members are republicans, or all members are democrats.

The number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with all republicans is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

The number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with all democrats is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Add these two cases together to get the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with all members from the same party:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62

Finally, subtract this number from the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee to get the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with at least one member from each party:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   The product divided by the average is 24:

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096

So the equation becomes:

\[

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[

Given that \(D\) is a point on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the length of \(BC\) and the sides \(AB\) and \(AC\).

First, we use the tangent function in triangles \(ABM\) and \(BDM\). In \(\triangle ABM\),
\[
\tan \angle BAM = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{a}{11}.
\]
Let \(\angle BAM = \theta\). Then \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\) and \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\).

In \(\triangle BDM\),
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{a}{1}.
\]
Since \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ - 3\theta\), we have
\[
\tan (90^\circ - 3\theta) = \cot 3\theta = \frac{1}{\tan 3\theta}.
\]
Using the tangent triple angle identity, \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\), we get
\[
\cot 3\theta = \frac{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\tan \angle BDM\), we have
\[
\frac{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta} = a.
\]
Substituting \(\tan \theta = \frac{a}{11}\) into the equation, we get
\[
\frac{1 - 3\left(\frac{a}{11}\right)^2}{3\left(\frac{a}{11}\right) - \left(\frac{a}{11}\right)^3} = a.

Simplifying the numerator and the denominator, we have

\[

\[

\]
\[
1331 - 33a^2 = 363a^2 - a^4,

\[

Let \(x = a^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{785.2}{2} = 392.6 \quad \text{(not an integer)} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{6.8}{2} = 3.4.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two roots: \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is less than zero between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, we have:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the part of the solution where \(y < 0\). Thus, we get:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, define \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(-4 < y^2 + 4y\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
This can be factored as:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The expression \((y + 2)^2\) is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at \(y = -2\). It is greater than zero for all \(y\) except \(y = -2\). Therefore, we have:
\[y \neq -2.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, \(y\) can never be \(-2\). Thus, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get:

\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[

\[

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

"To determine in which class the number of male bus riders is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders, we need to calculate the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders for each class and then find the class where this ratio is closest to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus riders for each class:
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class:
  - Number of male bus riders: \(41.1\% \times 600 = 246.6 \approx 247\)
  - Number of female bus riders: \(39.4\% \times 600 = 236.4 \approx 236\)
  - Ratio: \(\frac{247}{236} \approx 1.0466\)

- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class:
  - Number of male bus riders: \(34.4\% \times 600 = 206.4 \approx 206\)
  - Number of female bus riders: \(33.1\% \times 600 = 198.6 \approx 199\)
  - Ratio: \(\frac{206}{199} \approx 1.0352\)

- For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class:
  - Number of male bus riders: \(20.6\% \times 600 = 123.6 \approx 124\)
  - Number of female bus riders: \(13.8\% \times 600 = 82.8 \approx 83\)
  - Ratio: \(\frac{124}{83} \approx 1.4939\)

- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class:
  - Number of male bus riders: \(11.6\% \times 600 = 69.6 \approx 70\)
  - Number of female bus riders: \(8.6\% \times 600 = 51.6 \approx 52\)
  - Ratio: \(\frac{70}{52} \approx 1.3462\)

Now, we compare these ratios to \(1.35\):
- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.0466\), which is \(1.35 - 1.0466 = 0.3034\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.0352\), which is \(1.35 - 1.0352 = 0.3148\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.4939\), which is \(1.4939 - 1.35 = 0.1439\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.3462\), which is \(1.35 - 1.3462 = 0.0038\) away from \(1.35\).

The smallest difference is \(0.0038\), which corresponds to the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class.

Therefore, the class in which the number of male bus riders is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders is \(\boxed{12^{\text{th}}}\).","[135*(1/100), '12^{']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

In boxed form, the answer is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular field inside the football field, we need to analyze the given diagram and the constraints provided. The football field consists of a rectangle with two semicircular ends, and the total length of the field is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangular part of the field by \( L \) meters and the width of the rectangular part (which is also the diameter of the semicircles) by \( W \) meters. The radius of each semicircle is therefore \( \frac{W}{2} \) meters.

The total length of the field is the sum of the length of the rectangular part and the circumferences of the two semicircles. Since the circumference of a full circle is \( 2\pi r \), the circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi r \). Therefore, the total length of the field is:
\[
L + 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \pi W \right) = L + \pi W
\]
We know that the total length of the field is 400 meters, so we can write:
\[
L + \pi W = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \), we get:
\[
L = 400 - \pi W
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular part of the field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = (400 - \pi W) W = 400W - \pi W^2
\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 400 - 2\pi W
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
400 - 2\pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
W = \frac{400}{2\pi} = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right) = 400 - 200 = 200
\]
The maximum area \( A \) is then:
\[
A = L \times W = 200 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{40000}{\pi}
\]
Therefore, the maximum possible area of the rectangular field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\) and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2.

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x^2 + 4 = 25

   \[
   x^2 = 21

   \[

   \]
   So, the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) is \(\sqrt{21}\).

3. **Determine \(\sin{T}\):**

"To solve the problem, we start with the well-known physics formula that states force is equal to mass times acceleration, which can be written as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force,
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( a \) is the acceleration (or kiihtyvyys in Finnish).

In this problem, Jen and Jack are throwing balls with the same force. Let's denote the force as \( F \), the mass of Jen's pebble as \( m_1 = 200 \) g, and the mass of Jack's baseball as \( m_2 = 150 \) g. Let \( a_1 \) be the acceleration of Jen's pebble and \( a_2 \) be the acceleration of Jack's baseball. According to the formula, we have:

\[ F = m_1 \cdot a_1 \]
\[ F = m_2 \cdot a_2 \]

Since the force is the same for both balls, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_1 \cdot a_1 = m_2 \cdot a_2 \]

Substituting the masses into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_1 = 150 \cdot a_2 \]

To find the ratio of Jen's pebble's acceleration to Jack's baseball's acceleration, we solve for \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \):

\[ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{150}{200} \]

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

\[ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of Jen's pebble's kiihtyvyyden to Jack's baseball's kiihtyvyyteen is:

"To determine how many same digits are present in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder } 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder } 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder } 5

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

\[

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder } 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder } 6

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

\[

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We list the digits in each representation:

- Base 7 digits: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8 digits: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

Now, we identify the common digits between the two sets:

- The digit \(1\) appears in both representations.
- The digit \(5\) appears in both representations.
- The digit \(6\) appears in both representations.

Thus, the common digits are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\).

\]

where the line is in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,

2. Five pencils and one eraser cost \$1.82:
   \[

To eliminate the variable \( e \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:

Solving for \( p \), we divide both sides by 2:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) as the origin. Assume \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The condition \(AB/AD = k\) implies that \(\frac{2a}{2b} = k\) or \(a = kb\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The distance from \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). We need to find the region where \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\) for all four vertices.

Let's start with the inequality for vertex \(A\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2

Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < -a^2 - b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

This is the equation of a line. Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:
\[
ax + by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax + by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[

These four inequalities define a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:

The area of the original rectangle is:

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{16a^2b^2}

Since \(a = kb\), we substitute \(a\) with \(kb\):
\[
\frac{(k^2b^2 + b^2)^2}{16(kb)^2b^2} = \frac{(b^2(k^2 + 1))^2}{16k^2b^4} = \frac{b^4(k^2 + 1)^2}{16k^2b^4} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{16k^2}

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\) by dividing 54 by 6:
\[
q = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]
Next, we use the quotient to find the remainder \(r\) by substituting \(q\) back into the division algorithm:
\[
54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
54 = 54 + r
\]
To isolate \(r\), we subtract 54 from both sides:
\[
r = 54 - 54 = 0
\]
Thus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students in the class.

First, let's calculate the total score of the students:
- 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these scores to get the total score of the class:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students in the class to find the average score:
\[\text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given \( 3 \times 3 \) matrix is a magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals is the same. The matrix is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3 + n+2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n-9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13
\]

And the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

For the matrix to be a magic square, all these sums must be equal. Therefore, we set the sums equal to each other and solve for \( n \).

From the sums of the rows and columns, we have:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

We need to verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the sums of the diagonals:
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
4n - 13 = 4(7) - 13 = 28 - 13 = 15
\]

The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, \( n = 7 \) is indeed the correct value.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"To find the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we substitute \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega^2 + \omega = -1\):
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
