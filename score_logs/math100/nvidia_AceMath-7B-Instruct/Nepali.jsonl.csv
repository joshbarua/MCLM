"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \),
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (\sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   We expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   Simplifying each term separately,
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} = 1 + i,
   \]
   and
   \[
   (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} i + \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} i^2.
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \),
   \[
   \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} i + \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} (-1) = \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} i - \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}.
   \]
   Combining the real and imaginary parts, we get
   \[
   z'' = \left( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right) + \left( 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right) i = \left( \frac{2 - 3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{2 + 3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right) i = \left( \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right) i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = \left( \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 2 \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} - 3 \right) i = \left( \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2} + 4}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4 - 6}{2} \right) i = \left( \frac{12 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 10}{2} \right) i.

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying the general term, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[
15 - 5k = 0

Solving for \(k\), we get:

\[

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

"To determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[ n = 7k + 2. \]
Then,
\[ n + 2 = 7k + 4, \]
\[ n + 4 = 7k + 6, \]
\[ n + 6 = 7k + 8. \]

Now, we need to find the product \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7:
\[ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \pmod{7}. \]

Since \(7k \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\), we can simplify the expression to:
\[ (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}. \]

Next, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\):
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24, \]
\[ 24 \cdot 8 = 192. \]

Now, we find the remainder when 192 is divided by 7:
\[ 192 \div 7 = 27 \text{ remainder } 3. \]
So,

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), let the fourth vertex be \((x, y)\).

First, we find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be the same:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices.

Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be the same:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid.

Finally, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be the same:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\), this solution is valid.

Finally, we find \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, let's compute \( A^T A \):
\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}, \]
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[ \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0. \]
Solving the quadratic equation, we get:
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}. \]
Thus, the eigenvalues are:
\[ \lambda_1 = 16, \quad \lambda_2 = 1. \]

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\). This means the operator norm of \( A \) is 4.

Hence, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the number of tricks whose combined weight is equal to the weight of one squiggle.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one trick.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squiggle.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one gull.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. The weight of ten tricks is equal to the weight of three squiggles plus the weight of one gull:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. The weight of two tricks plus the weight of one gull is equal to the weight of one squiggle:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to eliminate \( G \) from these equations to find a relationship between \( T \) and \( S \). First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Combine like terms on the right side:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to isolate terms involving \( T \) on one side:
\[
12T = 4S

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
3T = S

or
\[
S = 3T

This equation tells us that the weight of one squiggle is equal to the weight of three tricks. Therefore, the combined weight of one squiggle is equal to the weight of three tricks.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this polynomial is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

5. The constant term is \(-2a\), so we have:

"To determine the value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each of the coordinate axes at most once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) defined piecewise:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Intersection with the y-axis

The y-intercept occurs when \( x = 0 \). We need to evaluate \( f(0) \):

- For \( x < a \):
  \[
  f(0) = a \cdot 0 + 2a = 2a.
  \]

Thus, the y-intercept is \( (0, 2a) \).

### Step 2: Intersection with the x-axis

The x-intercept occurs when \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. **For \( x \geq a \)**:
   \[
   ax^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = 0 \implies x = 0.
   \]
   However, since \( x \geq a \), this case does not yield a valid x-intercept unless \( a \leq 0 \).

2. **For \( x < a \)**:
   \[
   ax + 2a = 0 \implies ax = -2a.
   \]
   If \( a \neq 0 \):
   \[
   x = -2.
   \]
   This is a valid x-intercept as long as \( -2 < a \).

### Step 3: Analyzing the conditions

To ensure that the graph intersects each axis at most once, we need to consider the following conditions:

1. The y-intercept \( (0, 2a) \) must be unique, which is always true since it is determined by \( a \).
2. The x-intercept \( (-2, 0) \) must be unique, which requires \( -2 < a \).
3. The function must not intersect the axes more than once. This means we need to ensure that the parabola \( ax^2 \) does not intersect the x-axis for \( x \geq a \) unless \( a \leq 0 \).

### Step 4: Conclusion

Combining the conditions, we find that:

- For \( a > 0 \), the x-intercept \( (-2, 0) \) is valid, and the parabola \( ax^2 \) does not intersect the x-axis for \( x \geq a \).
- For \( a \leq 0 \), the x-intercept \( (-2, 0) \) is not valid since \( -2 < a \) does not hold.

Thus, the maximum value of \( a \) that satisfies the condition of intersecting each axis at most once is when \( a \) is just above \( -2 \). The largest integer value of \( a \) that satisfies this condition is \( a = 0 \).

"To find the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that for \(x \in [0,1]\), \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(x \in [0,1]\), the second solution is valid if and only if \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). This inequality simplifies to:

\[ 0 \le \lambda - 1 \le \lambda, \]
\[ 1 \le \lambda \le 2. \]

So, the fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(1 \le \lambda \le 2\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's start by finding \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need this to equal \(x\):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]

Since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(x = \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)}\) into \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\):

\[ y = \lambda \left( \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y}{1 - y} \left( \frac{\lambda (1 - y) - y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y (\lambda - \lambda y - y)}{\lambda (1 - y)^2} = \frac{y (\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y)}{\lambda (1 - y)^2}. \]

Multiplying both sides by \(\lambda (1 - y)^2\), we get:

\[ \lambda y (1 - y)^2 = y (\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y). \]

Assuming \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[ \lambda (1 - y)^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y. \]

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

\[ \lambda (1 - 2y + y^2) = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda - 2\lambda y + \lambda y^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda y^2 - 2\lambda y + (\lambda + 1)y = 0, \]
\[ y (\lambda y - 2\lambda + \lambda + 1) = 0, \]
\[ y (\lambda y - \lambda + 1) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ y = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

If \(y = 0\), then \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point. If \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(x = \frac{\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}}{\lambda \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}}{\lambda \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda}} = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), which is also a fixed point.

However, we need \(f(x) \neq x\), so \(y \neq 0\) and \(y \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). This means that \(y\) must be a solution to the quadratic equation \(\lambda y^2 - 2\lambda y + (\lambda + 1) = 0\) that is not a fixed point. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:

\[ \Delta = (-2\lambda)^2 - 4 \cdot \lambda \cdot (\lambda + 1) = 4\lambda^2 - 4\lambda^2 - 4\lambda = -4\lambda. \]

For the quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative, but \(-4\lambda\) is non-negative only if \(\lambda = 0\), which is not in the range \(1 \le \lambda \le 2\). Therefore, there are no real solutions to the quadratic equation that are not fixed points.

Thus, the only values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are those for which the fixed points are not solutions to the quadratic equation, which is not possible in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To find the value of \(\theta\) for which the given expression is valid, we start by simplifying the given expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine. Recall that:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these identities, we can rewrite the numerator and the denominator of the given expression.

The numerator is:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, this becomes:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula, this becomes:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We need to find an angle \(\theta\) such that this expression is equal to \(\tan \theta\). By inspection or using known values, we find that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we can see that this expression is equal to \(\tan 45^\circ = 1\). Therefore, the value of \(\theta\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word contains repeated letters. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E, where the letter E appears twice and the letter L appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[

So, the expression becomes:

\frac{5040}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   This means there are 8 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40).

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1

   This means there is 1 multiple of 25 (25).

3. Count the multiples of 125 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
   This means there are no multiples of 125 in this range.

Since higher powers of 5 will also contribute factors of 5, but there are no such multiples in the range from 1 to 42, we stop here.

Adding up all the factors of 5, we get:

The area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product, i.e., \(\frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v}\|\).

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

Given that \(M\) and \(N\) are points on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively, such that \(GM \parallel BC\) and \(GN \parallel BC\), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since \(GM \parallel BC\), triangles \(AGM\) and \(ABD\) are similar, and since \(GN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AGN\) and \(ACD\) are similar.

The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the corresponding medians, which is 2:1. Therefore, the height from \(G\) to \(AB\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\), and the height from \(G\) to \(AC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\).

Now, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AC\) and \(N\) is on \(AC\) such that \(GN \parallel BC\), \(N\) is the midpoint of \(AC\). Therefore, \(EN\) is half the length of \(AC\).

"To determine the probability that a checker will be placed in a shaded square on a checkerboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of squares on the checkerboard:**
   A standard checkerboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, so the total number of squares is:
   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64
   \]

2. **Identify the number of shaded squares on the checkerboard:**
   In a standard checkerboard, half of the squares are shaded and the other half are unshaded. Therefore, the number of shaded squares is:
   \[
   \frac{64}{2} = 32
   \]

3. **Determine the probability that a checker will be placed in a shaded square:**
   The probability is the ratio of the number of shaded squares to the total number of squares. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{32}{64} = \frac{1}{2}

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\). So, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal. Performing the division, we get:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we identify the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). We sum these digits:

First, we note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). We can use this identity to find the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\):

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Therefore, the original expression becomes:

"To find the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The magnitude of this vector is:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we find:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). The polynomial \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the polynomial \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. This means that if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Since the roots of \( g(x) \) are each 5 less than the roots of \( f(x) \), the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the sum of the interior angles of the polygon be \(S\). Since the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), the sum of all the interior angles \(S\) is:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   where \(x\) is the measure of the one interior angle that is not included in the sum.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Using the formula for the sum of the interior angles, we have:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of the interior angles \(S\) must be slightly more than \(1070^\circ\) but less than \(1070^\circ + 180^\circ = 1250^\circ\).

3. **Find the possible value of \(n\):**
   We need to find \(n\) such that:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   First, solve the inequality:
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   This means the measure of the one interior angle that is not included is:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(x = 10^\circ\) is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon, the solution is correct.

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

Let's start by expanding and rewriting the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We need to solve this quadratic congruence. First, we find the discriminant of the quadratic equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 = 0 \):
\[ \Delta = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) = 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to check if 8 is a quadratic residue modulo 23. We do this by finding the Legendre symbol \( \left( \frac{8}{23} \right) \):
\[ \left( \frac{8}{23} \right) = \left( \frac{2^3}{23} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{23} \right)^3 \]

Since 23 is a prime of the form \( 8k + 7 \), we know that \( \left( \frac{2}{23} \right) = -1 \). Therefore:
\[ \left( \frac{8}{23} \right) = (-1)^3 = -1 \]

This means that 8 is not a quadratic residue modulo 23, and the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \) has no solutions. However, we need to re-evaluate the problem because the problem states that there is a unique odd integer \( t \) that satisfies the condition.

Let's recheck the problem statement and the conditions. The correct interpretation should be that \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, which means \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). We need to solve this congruence again.

We can use the quadratic formula to solve \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \):
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]

Since 8 is not a quadratic residue modulo 23, we need to find the correct interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation.

The correct interpretation should be that \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, which means \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). We need to solve this congruence again.

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]

Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
2 \frac{x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the solutions to the equation are

\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):

\[

"To find the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are no restrictions on the order in which they are chosen. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the points is simply the number of ways to arrange 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]

2. **Determine the number of ways the chords intersect:**
   For the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their rotations and reflections).

   There are 2 possible alternating patterns for any given arrangement of the points. Since there are \(4!\) total arrangements, the number of arrangements where the chords intersect is:

   \[
   2 \times \frac{4!}{4} = 2 \times 6 = 12

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\). Let's start by analyzing the given information and the diagram.

1. **Identify the areas of the circles and the shaded regions:**
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \(1\).
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\).
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\).
   - The total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

2. **Determine the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   - Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians.
   - The area of the sector of the larger circle with radius \(2\) and angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta\).

3. **Determine the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   - The area of the sector of the smaller circle with radius \(1\) and angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

   - The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \sin \theta\).

5. **Express the total area of the shaded regions in terms of \(\theta\):**
   - The total area of the shaded regions is the sum of the area of the sector of the larger circle, the area of the sector of the smaller circle, and the area of the triangle \(ADC\).
   - Therefore, the total area of the shaded regions is \(2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} + \sin \theta = \frac{5\theta}{2} + \sin \theta\).

6. **Set up the equation and solve for \(\theta\):**
   - We know that the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\).
   - So, we have the equation \(\frac{5\theta}{2} + \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

7. **Estimate the value of \(\theta\):**
   - Since \(\sin \theta\) is a small value compared to \(\frac{5\theta}{2}\) for small \(\theta\), we can approximate \(\frac{5\theta}{2} \approx \frac{5\pi}{3}\).
   - Solving for \(\theta\), we get \(\theta \approx \frac{2\pi}{3}\).

8. **Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:**
   - Since \(\pi\) radians is \(180\) degrees, \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians is \(\frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 120\) degrees.

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

3. **Use the tangent function to find \(\angle BAC\):**
   Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BM = MC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

   1 = \frac{363 - x^2}{11(121 - 3x^2)}.
   \]
   Cross-multiplying gives:
   \[
   11(121 - 3x^2) = 363 - x^2.
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying:
   \[
   1331 - 33x^2 = 363 - x^2 \implies 968 = 32x^2 \implies x^2 = \frac{968}{32} = 30.25 \implies x = 5.5.

   Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 2 \cdot 5.5 = 11\).

   In right triangle \(ABM\), we have:
   \[
   AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + 5.5^2} = \sqrt{121 + 30.25} = \sqrt{151.25} = \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}.

   Since \(AB = AC\), we have \(AC = \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}\).

5. **Calculate the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\):**
   The perimeter is:
   \[
   AB + AC + BC = \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2} + 11 = 11\sqrt{5} + 11 = 11(\sqrt{5} + 1).

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two roots: \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is less than zero between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, we have:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the part of the solution where \(y < 0\). Thus, we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(-4 < y^2 + 4y\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
This can be factored as:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The expression \((y + 2)^2\) is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at \(y = -2\). It is greater than zero for all \(y\) except \(y = -2\). Therefore, we have:
\[y \neq -2.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[x^2 \neq -2.\]
Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, this inequality is always true for all real \(x\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:

\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).

Next, we use the identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[

\]
Substituting the given value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 4p).
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 4p^3}{p^2},
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12(144 - 4p^3)}{p^3},

"To determine in which class the number of male students who take the bus is closest to 135% of the number of female students who take the bus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of male students who take the bus in each class.
2. Calculate the number of female students who take the bus in each class.
3. Calculate 135% of the number of female students who take the bus in each class.
4. Compare the number of male students who take the bus to 135% of the number of female students who take the bus in each class.

Let's start with the calculations:

### Class 9
- Number of male students who take the bus: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3\)
- Number of female students who take the bus: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2\)
- 135% of the number of female students who take the bus: \(135\% \times 118.2 = 159.63\)

The difference between the number of male students who take the bus and 135% of the number of female students who take the bus is:
\[159.63 - 123.3 = 36.33\]

### Class 10
- Number of male students who take the bus: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2\)
- Number of female students who take the bus: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3\)
- 135% of the number of female students who take the bus: \(135\% \times 99.3 = 133.955\)

The difference between the number of male students who take the bus and 135% of the number of female students who take the bus is:
\[133.955 - 103.2 = 30.755\]

### Class 11
- Number of male students who take the bus: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 61.8\)
- Number of female students who take the bus: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4\)
- 135% of the number of female students who take the bus: \(135\% \times 41.4 = 55.89\)

The difference between the number of male students who take the bus and 135% of the number of female students who take the bus is:
\[55.89 - 61.8 = -5.91\]

### Class 12
- Number of male students who take the bus: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 34.8\)
- Number of female students who take the bus: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8\)
- 135% of the number of female students who take the bus: \(135\% \times 25.8 = 34.83\)

The difference between the number of male students who take the bus and 135% of the number of female students who take the bus is:
\[34.83 - 34.8 = 0.03\]

From the above calculations, we can see that the smallest difference is in Class 12. Therefore, the class in which the number of male students who take the bus is closest to 135% of the number of female students who take the bus is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

"To find the minimum distance between the point \( P(1, 2) \) and the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by defining the distance function between a point \( (x, y) \) on the curve and the point \( P(1, 2) \). The distance \( D \) is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 2 \right)^2} \]

To minimize \( D \), it is equivalent to minimize the square of the distance \( D^2 \):

\[ D^2 = (x - 1)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 2 \right)^2 \]

Let's denote \( f(x) = D^2 \):

\[ f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 2 \right)^2 \]

First, we expand and simplify the expression inside the second term:

\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 2 = \frac{x^2 - 3}{\sqrt{2}} - 2 = \frac{x^2 - 3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \]

So, the function \( f(x) \) becomes:

\[ f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + \left( \frac{x^2 - 3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = (x - 1)^2 + \frac{(x^2 - 3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2}{2} \]

Next, we take the derivative of \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero to find the critical points:

\[ f'(x) = 2(x - 1) + \frac{2(x^2 - 3 - 2\sqrt{2})(2x)}{2} = 2(x - 1) + (x^2 - 3 - 2\sqrt{2})(2x) \]

\[ f'(x) = 2(x - 1) + 2x(x^2 - 3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = 2(x - 1 + x^3 - 3x - 2\sqrt{2}x) = 2(x^3 - 2x - 1 - 2\sqrt{2}x) \]

Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\[ x^3 - 2x - 1 - 2\sqrt{2}x = 0 \]

We need to solve this cubic equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \( x = \sqrt{2} \) is a root. Substituting \( x = \sqrt{2} \) back into the curve equation to find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate:

\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

So, the point on the curve closest to \( P(1, 2) \) is \( \left( \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \). Now, we calculate the distance between \( P(1, 2) \) and \( \left( \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \):

\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2} - 1)^2 + \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2 \right)^2} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{(2 - 2\sqrt{2} + 1) + \left( \frac{-\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)^2} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{3 - 2\sqrt{2} + \frac{(\sqrt{2} + 4)^2}{4}} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{3 - 2\sqrt{2} + \frac{2 + 8\sqrt{2} + 16}{4}} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{3 - 2\sqrt{2} + \frac{18 + 8\sqrt{2}}{4}} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{3 - 2\sqrt{2} + \frac{9}{2} + 2\sqrt{2}} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{3 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{6}{2} + \frac{9}{2}} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{15}{2}} \]

\[ D = \frac{\sqrt{30}}{2} \]

Thus, the minimum distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{30}}{2} \). In the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we have \( a = 30 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 30 + 2 = 32 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors: \( x = 0 \) and \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution. Testing other possible rational roots or using numerical methods would show that there are no other real roots greater than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center.

However, for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is also equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the opposite vertices. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices.

Let the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex be \( x \). Without loss of generality, assume \( x \) is the distance to the vertex opposite to the vertex at distance 3. Then, the sum of the squares of the distances is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = (3^2 + 11^2) + (7^2 + 9^2) + (8^2 + x^2) \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = 324 + x^2 \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ (9 + 121) + (49 + 81) + (64 + x^2) = 130 + 130 + 64 + x^2 = 324 + x^2 \]

Since both sides are equal, we can see that the equation holds true. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is the same as the distance to the vertex opposite to the vertex at distance 3, which is 11.

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",\sqrt{66},[],False

S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

First, we find the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We start by expressing \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so we use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and the polynomial is palindromic. This implies that the roots can be paired such that the products of the pairs are equal. Therefore, the values of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) must be the roots of a cubic polynomial whose coefficients are symmetric functions of the roots of the original polynomial.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the sum of the roots is zero, the roots of the cubic polynomial must be \(2, -1, -1\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 500 is greater than 137, the integer part of the quotient is 0. So, we write 0. and then proceed with the division by adding a decimal point and zeros to 137.
3. Now, we divide 1370 by 500, which gives 2 (because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\), which is less than 1370, and \(500 \times 3 = 1500\), which is greater than 1370). So, we write 2 after the decimal point.
4. Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
5. Bring down another 0 to make it 3700. Now, divide 3700 by 500, which gives 7 (because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\), which is less than 3700, and \(500 \times 8 = 4000\), which is greater than 3700). So, we write 7 after the 2.
6. Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get a remainder of 200.
7. Bring down another 0 to make it 2000. Now, divide 2000 by 500, which gives 4 (because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\), which is equal to 2000). So, we write 4 after the 7.
8. Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0. Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete.

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

The last non-zero digit in the decimal representation \(0.274\) is 4.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \(ABCD\):
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region inside the rectangle where the distance to the center is less than the distance to any vertex. This means we need to solve the inequalities:
\[
d_O < d_A, \quad d_O < d_B, \quad d_O < d_C, \quad d_O < d_D
\]

Let's start with the inequality \(d_O < d_A\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the other inequalities:
\[
d_O < d_B: \quad ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
d_O < d_C: \quad -ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
d_O < d_D: \quad -ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These four inequalities define a smaller rectangle inside the original rectangle \(ABCD\). The vertices of this smaller rectangle are the points where the lines intersect the sides of the original rectangle. The side lengths of the smaller rectangle are half the side lengths of the original rectangle, i.e., \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{ab}{2}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = 2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{\frac{ab}{2}}{4ab} = \frac{1}{8}

Thus, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
2. Identify the quotient and the remainder.

First, let's perform the division:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

The quotient is 9. Now, to find the remainder, we can use the relationship between the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder, which is given by:

\[ \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder} \]

In this case, the dividend is 54, the divisor is 6, and the quotient is 9. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 54 = (6 \times 9) + \text{Remainder} \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 54 = 54 + \text{Remainder} \]

To isolate the remainder, we subtract 54 from both sides:

\[ \text{Remainder} = 54 - 54 \]
\[ \text{Remainder} = 0 \]

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

"To find the average (mean) score of the students in the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score of all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

Let's start with the first step. The total score is the sum of the scores of all the students. We know that:
- 20 students scored 80.
- 8 students scored 90.
- 2 students scored 100.

So, the total score can be calculated as:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplications:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Adding these values together gives the total score:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Now, we move to the second step. The number of students in the class is 30. To find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of students:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} \]

Performing the division gives:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the average score of the students in the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal.

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3 + n+2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n-9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, let's solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the other equation \( 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \):
\[
2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15
\]
\[
4(7) - 13 = 28 - 13 = 15

Since both equations are satisfied, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This implies that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 1\), \(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any one of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the concept of a minimum spanning tree (MST) for the complete graph formed by these four points. The MST is a tree that connects all the vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Here are the steps to find the shortest distance:

1. **Identify the distances between all pairs of points**: Let's denote the distances between the points as follows:
   - \(d_{AB}\) is the distance between points \(A\) and \(B\),
   - \(d_{AC}\) is the distance between points \(A\) and \(C\),
   - \(d_{AD}\) is the distance between points \(A\) and \(D\),
   - \(d_{BC}\) is the distance between points \(B\) and \(C\),
   - \(d_{BD}\) is the distance between points \(B\) and \(D\),
   - \(d_{CD}\) is the distance between points \(C\) and \(D\).

2. **Construct the minimum spanning tree**: The minimum spanning tree for a graph with 4 vertices will have 3 edges. We need to select the 3 edges with the smallest weights to form the MST. The total weight of the MST will be the sum of the weights of these 3 edges.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the MST**: The total weight of the MST is the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any one of the points and visiting the other three points exactly once.

Since the exact distances between the points are not provided in the problem, we cannot compute a numerical answer. However, the method to find the shortest distance is clear. The shortest distance is the total weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph formed by the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
