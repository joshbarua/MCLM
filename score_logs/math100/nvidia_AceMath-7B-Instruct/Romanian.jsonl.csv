"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then divide by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know \(DF = 10\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\) into the equation, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}i}{2} + \frac{6\sqrt{2}i^2}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots to simplify the expression. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Now that we have the prime factorization of 242, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\).
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within their block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the arrangements**: To find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units around the table by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True

"To determine the minimum number of degrees by which a regular pentagon must be rotated in the counterclockwise direction to coincide with its initial position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon.

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since this midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. The correct arrangement should be such that the diagonals still bisect each other, but with \(x > 7\).

Let's consider the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

Since this midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, this does not satisfy \(x > 7\).

Finally, let's consider the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since this midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). This satisfies \(x > 7\).

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(2\cos A\) for \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse in a right triangle and cannot be zero), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\tan A = 2

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now that we have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \), we can find \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

I can use the formula for the square of a binomial \((a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\) where \(a = 100\) and \(b = 1\):

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

1. Express \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\).
2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the first step. Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify the first fraction:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Now, the expression is:

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to eliminate \( G \) from these equations. First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides:
\[
12T = 4S
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
3T = S
\]
or
\[
S = 3T
\]

This tells us that the weight of one squig is three times the weight of one treek. To find out how many treeks have the same weight as one squig, we solve for \( T \) in terms of \( S \):
\[
T = \frac{S}{3}
\]

Therefore, the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of three treeks. The answer is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the reservoir is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the level of the water is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the height \( h \) of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. Let's denote the rate of change of the volume with respect to time as \( \frac{dV}{dt} \) and the rate of change of the height with respect to time as \( \frac{dh}{dt} \). From the problem, we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

To find the radius \( r \), we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the reservoir is:

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of the function \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both cases defined by the piecewise function.

1. **Case 1: \( x \geq a \)**

   The function is given by:
   \[
   f(x) = ax^2
   \]
   For \( x \geq a \), the function \( f(x) \) is a parabola opening upwards. The minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs at \( x = a \):
   \[
   f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3
   \]
   As \( x \) increases, \( f(x) \) increases without bound.

2. **Case 2: \( x < a \)**

   The function is given by:
   \[
   f(x) = ax + 2a
   \]
   This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \). The value of \( f(x) \) at \( x = a \) is:
   \[
   f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a
   \]
   As \( x \) decreases, \( f(x) \) decreases linearly.

To ensure that the graph of \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to check the values of \( f(x) \) at the boundary \( x = a \) and ensure that the function covers all values from the minimum value up to infinity.

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs at \( x = a \):
- From the quadratic case: \( f(a) = a^3 \)
- From the linear case: \( f(a) = a^2 + 2a \)

For the function to intersect every horizontal line, the minimum value from the quadratic case must be less than or equal to the minimum value from the linear case:
\[
a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a
\]

Rearranging this inequality gives:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0
\]
Factoring out \( a \):
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0
\]
Factoring the quadratic:
\[
a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0
\]

The roots of the equation \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0 \) are \( a = 0, a = 2, \) and \( a = -1 \). We analyze the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these roots:

- For \( a < -1 \): The expression is negative.
- For \( -1 < a < 0 \): The expression is positive.
- For \( 0 < a < 2 \): The expression is negative.
- For \( a > 2 \): The expression is positive.

The inequality \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) holds for:
- \( a \leq -1 \)
- \( 0 \leq a \leq 2 \)

Since we are looking for the largest value of \( a \) such that the function intersects every horizontal line, we consider the interval \( 0 \leq a \leq 2 \). The largest value in this interval is \( a = 2 \).

Thus, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\), so \(y\) must be a fixed point of \(f\). Therefore, \(y\) can be either 0 or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

We consider two cases:

1. \(y = 0\):
   \[
   f(x) = 0 \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = 0 \implies x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1.
   \]
   For \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), we have \(f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0\) or \(f(f(x)) = f(1) = 0\), respectively. So, \(f(f(x)) = x\) is not satisfied unless \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point. Therefore, this case does not give us any solutions.

2. \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\):
   \[
   f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda^2 x(1 - x) = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
   \]
   This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
   \[
   \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
   \]
   The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative for \(x\) to be real:
   \[
   \Delta = (-\lambda^2)^2 - 4(\lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) = \lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2 = \lambda^2(\lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 4) = \lambda^2(\lambda - 2)^2.
   \]
   Since \(\lambda^2 \geq 0\) and \((\lambda - 2)^2 \geq 0\), the discriminant is always non-negative. Therefore, the quadratic equation always has real solutions.

We need to ensure that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) be the solutions of the quadratic equation. Then \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). We need to check if \(f(x_1) = x_2\) or \(f(x_2) = x_1\).

Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) is a quadratic function, it is symmetric about \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, if \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are the roots of the quadratic equation, then \(x_1 + x_2 = 1\). This implies that \(f(x_1) = f(1 - x_1) = f(x_2)\). Therefore, \(f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2)) = x_1\) or \(x_2\), which satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Finally, we need to ensure that \(x_1 \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) and \(x_2 \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). This is true if \(\lambda \neq 2\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify \(\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator is \(\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ\).

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify \(\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator is \(-\cos 55^\circ\).

Now, we can find \(\tan \theta\):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

So, the expression becomes:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   This means there are 8 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40).

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42:

3. Count the multiples of 125 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
   This means there are no multiples of 125 in this range.

Since higher powers of 5 will also contribute factors of 5, but there are no multiples of 125 or higher in the range, we stop here.

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

"{To find the sixth term of the arithmetic progression, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic progression:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the equation for the fourth term to find \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term \(a_1\) and the common difference \(d\), we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:

"To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as a perfect \( n \)-th power. This means there exists an integer \( k \) such that

\[ 2^{24} = k^n. \]

Since the left side of the equation is a power of 2, \( k \) must also be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2^m \) into the equation, we get

\[ 2^{24} = (2^m)^n. \]

Using the property of exponents \((a^b)^c = a^{bc}\), we can simplify the right side to

"To determine how many 5-cent coins Hillary has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( x \) be the number of 10-cent coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of 5-cent coins.

We know two things from the problem:
1. The total number of coins is 12.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 12 \)
2. \( 10x + 5y = 75 \) (since each 10-cent coin is worth 10 cents and each 5-cent coin is worth 5 cents)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2x + y = 15 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 12 \)
2. \( 2x + y = 15 \)

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:

"To determine the area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the rectangle formed by the 12 squares. Since each square has a side length of 1, and there are 12 squares arranged in a rectangle, the possible dimensions of the rectangle are 3 by 4 (or 4 by 3). From the diagram, we can see that the rectangle is 3 units wide and 4 units tall.

Next, we need to find the area of the shaded region. The shaded region consists of two right triangles. Let's analyze each triangle separately.

1. The first triangle has its base along the bottom side of the rectangle and its height along the left side of the rectangle. The base of this triangle is 2 units (since it spans two squares) and the height is 4 units (since it spans four squares). The area of a triangle is given by the formula:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 3, and 5. Since the number must consist only of the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 0 to be divisible by 2 and 5. Additionally, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.

Let's start by considering the smallest numbers consisting of only the digits 0 and 1 that end in 0. These numbers are: 10, 110, 100, 1110, 1010, 1100, 1000, etc. We need to find the smallest of these numbers whose sum of digits is divisible by 3.

- The sum of the digits of 10 is \(1 + 0 = 1\), which is not divisible by 3.

3. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Since the first number can be any of 3 values and the second number can be any of 4 values, the total number of possible outcomes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

4. **Identify the shaded squares on the chessboard:**
   - A standard chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, with alternating shaded and unshaded squares.
   - The shaded squares in the first 4 rows are in columns 1, 3, 5, and 7.
   - The shaded squares in the next 4 rows are in columns 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so the expression becomes:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \sin^2 80^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[

We can use the double-angle identity \(\cos 20^\circ = 1 - 2 \sin^2 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 10^\circ}\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). Applying this identity, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term:

5. **Solve for \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the possible values of \(n\) by considering the range of \(x\). We start by isolating \(x\) in the equation:
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Since \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\), we have:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   This inequality can be split into two parts:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

   Solving the first part:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Solving the second part:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 180^\circ + 1070^\circ
   \]
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

   Combining both parts, we get:
   \[
   n = 8

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the definition of the modular inverse. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). According to the problem, \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, so we have:

\[ t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the values from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, we have:

\[ t = -1 \pm 5 \]

This gives us two possible solutions:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since we are looking for \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). We need to check if \( t = 4 \) is odd, but it is not. Therefore, we need to consider the other solution for \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23, which is \( x = -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). So, we have:

\[ t = -1 \pm 18 \]

This gives us two possible solutions:

\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
\[ t = -1 - 18 = -19 \]

Since we are looking for \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -19 \) and keep \( t = 17 \). We need to check if \( t = 17 \) is odd, and it is. Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) that satisfies the given conditions is:

"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we first need to recognize that this sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
For our sequence, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.

Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3},

which simplifies to

\[

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
   The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

2. **Determine the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values for the interior points:**
   The interior points must have \(x\) values strictly between \(-5\) and \(5\), and \(y\) values strictly between \(-4\) and \(4\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\), and the possible integer values for \(y\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{z}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times (\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{z} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{z}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression reduces to

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Now, we substitute the given values for \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[

\[

Now, we add these vectors together:

"To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezoid \(ABCD\). We know that \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we need to use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the base of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(a\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector, the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) is equal to the ratio of their bases \(BC\) and \(AD\):
\[
\frac{[ \triangle ABC ]}{[ \triangle ACD ]} = \frac{b}{a}
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ \triangle ABC ] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

Using the ratio of the areas, we have:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h}{\frac{1}{2} \times a \times h} = \frac{b}{a}
\]

This confirms that the areas are indeed in the ratio \(b:a\). Since the total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\), we can write:
\[
[ \triangle ABC ] + [ \triangle ACD ] = 42
\]

Let \(x = [ \triangle ACD ]\). Then:
\[
[ \triangle ABC ] = \frac{b}{a} \times x
\]

Substituting these into the total area equation, we get:
\[
\frac{b}{a} \times x + x = 42
\]

Factoring out \(x\), we have:
\[
x \left( \frac{b}{a} + 1 \right) = 42
\]

Since \(\frac{b}{a} + 1 = \frac{a + b}{a}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
x \times \frac{a + b}{a} = 42
\]

We know from the area of the trapezoid that \(\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42\), so \((a + b) \times h = 84\). Substituting \(h\) for \(a\) in the equation, we get:
\[
x \times \frac{84}{2a} = 42

Simplifying, we find:
\[
x \times \frac{42}{a} = 42

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form one segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the other segment. This can be calculated as:

"To determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the two circles and the area of the shaded region. The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\) and the area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\).

The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of these two areas:
\[
2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
\]

We set this equal to the area of the shaded region calculated earlier:
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3}
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

To convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees, we use the fact that \(\pi\) radians is 180 degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180}{3} = 120

"To determine how many cylindrical pints of water are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical pints and the spherical reservoir and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical pint. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical pint, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical reservoir, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical pints are needed to fill the spherical reservoir, we divide the volume of the spherical reservoir by the volume of one cylindrical pint:
\[ \text{Number of pints} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical pints of water needed to fill the spherical reservoir is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, the expression becomes \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A)
\]

This is a product of two binomials, which can be expanded as:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A = 2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]

Notice that the terms \(2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A\) cancel each other out:
\[
2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - 2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A = 0
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin^2 B \cos^2 A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B
\]

We know that \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\cos^2 A = 1 - \sin^2 A = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84
\]
\[
\cos^2 B = 1 - \sin^2 B = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin^2 B \cos^2 A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = 0.5^2 \cdot 0.84 - 0.4^2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 \cdot 0.84 - 0.16 \cdot 0.75 = 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the committee:**
   The committee has a total of \(8 + 6 = 14\) members. The number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{14}{5}\):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   There are 8 Republicans, so the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is \(\binom{8}{5}\):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:**
   There are 6 Democrats, so the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is \(\binom{6}{5}\):

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party:**
   This is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

"To solve for the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

Since we are asked for the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \) and keep \( x = 66 \).

Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To find the perimeter of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we start by considering the point \(D\) on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle BMA = 90^\circ\).

Using the tangent function in \(\triangle BMD\) and \(\triangle BMA\), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{MD} \quad \text{and} \quad \tan \angle BMA = \frac{BM}{MA}.
\]
Since \(\angle BMA = 90^\circ\), \(\tan \angle BMA = \infty\), but we can use the fact that \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}\) and \(\angle BMA = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\).

Using the tangent triple angle identity, we have:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\) and the properties of the isosceles triangle. We can use the fact that the tangent of the angles at \(D\) and \(M\) are related by the ratio of the sides.

Since \(AD = 10\) and \(AM = 11\), \(MD = 1\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{1} = BM \quad \text{and} \quad \tan \angle BMA = \frac{BM}{11}.

Using the tangent triple angle identity, we can find that:
\[

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the tangent of the angles at \(D\) and \(M\) are related by the ratio of the sides. We can use the fact that the tangent of the angles at \(D\) and \(M\) are related by the ratio of the sides.

Using the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we can use the fact that the tangent of the angles at \(D\) and \(M\) are related by the ratio of the sides. We can use the fact that the tangent of the angles at \(D\) and \(M\) are related by the ratio of the sides.

Finally, we can use the fact that the perimeter of the triangle is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC.

Using the fact that \(AB = AC\) and \(BC = 2BM\), we can find that:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative, which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\). This inequality is always true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

We start by making a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two roots: \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola that opens upwards (since the coefficient of \(y^2\) is positive). Therefore, the expression is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). So, we have:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]

Recall that \(y = x^2\). Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the part of the solution where \(y < 0\). Thus, we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[-8 + 36 = \frac{1728}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[28 = \frac{1728}{p^3}.\]
Solving for \(p^3\), we get
\[p^3 = \frac{1728}{28} = \frac{432}{7}.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

However, we need to check if this value is consistent with the original equations. Instead, we can use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try to find a simpler solution. By trial and error or further algebraic manipulation, we find that \(p = 6\) is a solution that satisfies both equations.

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True

- Number of girls who use the bus: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.5122\)

**Class 12:**
- Number of boys who use the bus: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35\)
- Number of girls who use the bus: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.3462\)

Now, we compare these ratios to \(135\% = 1.35\):

\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Now, let's determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the variables for the length and width of the rectangle. Let the length of the rectangle be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters. The pista consists of the two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles at the ends, each with a radius equal to the width of the rectangle divided by 2, i.e., \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total length of the pista is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \times \frac{W}{2} \), so the circumferences of two semicircles together is \( 2 \times \pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \pi W \). Therefore, the total length of the pista is given by:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W \implies L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
We substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \times \frac{200}{\pi} = 200 - 100 = 100
\]
The maximum area \( A \) is then:
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]
Thus, the maximum area of the field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2.

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

The answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by considering the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Let the vertices of the octahedron be \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \) where \( A_1 \) is opposite to \( A_4 \), \( A_2 \) is opposite to \( A_5 \), and \( A_3 \) is opposite to \( A_6 \). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to \( 3d^2 \), where \( d \) is the distance between any two opposite vertices.

Let the distances from \( P \) to the vertices be \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6 \). Then we have:
\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 = 3d^2. \]

We know five of these distances: \( d_1 = 3 \), \( d_2 = 7 \), \( d_3 = 8 \), \( d_4 = 9 \), and \( d_5 = 11 \). Let \( d_6 = x \). Then:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 3d^2. \]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the known distances:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324. \]

So, we have:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 3d^2. \]

Since \( d^2 \) is the square of the distance between any two opposite vertices, and the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices is equal to \( 3d^2 \). Therefore, we need to find \( x \) such that:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 3d^2. \]

However, we do not need the exact value of \( d^2 \) to find \( x \). We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices is constant and that the distances are symmetric. The only distance that fits the pattern and the sum of the squares is the one that is the same as the sum of the squares of the other distances. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:
\[ x = 6. \]

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[

\[

\[

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We list the digits in each representation:

- Digits in \(1556_7\): \(1, 5, 6\)

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can simplify this expression.

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area of smaller rectangle}}{\text{Area of original rectangle}} = \frac{\frac{ab}{4}}{ab} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Thus, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6:
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9
   \]
   This tells us that 6 goes into 54 exactly 9 times.

2. Multiply the quotient by 6 to find the product:
   \[
   9 \times 6 = 54
   \]
   This tells us that 54 is exactly divisible by 6.

3. Subtract the product from 54 to find the remainder:
   \[
   54 - 54 = 0
   \]
   This tells us that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0.

Therefore, the remainder of \(54 \mod 6\) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many cents of money have remained after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie converted their winnings into the largest possible denominations of bills, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money won by all four individuals.
2. Convert the total amount into dollars and cents.
3. Determine the largest possible denominations of bills that can be used to convert the total amount.
4. Calculate the remaining cents after converting the largest possible denominations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money won by all four individuals:
\[
\text{Linda's winnings} = \$27.47
\]
\[
\text{Sherry's winnings} = \$35.23
\]
\[
\text{June's winnings} = \$37.37
\]
\[
\text{Connie's winnings} = \$26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
\text{Total winnings} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money won is \$126.59. This is equivalent to 126 dollars and 59 cents.

Next, we convert the total amount into the largest possible denominations of bills. The largest bill is a $100 bill, so we can use one $100 bill:
\[
126.59 - 100 = 26.59
\]

Now, the remaining amount is \$26.59. The next largest bill is a $20 bill, so we can use one $20 bill:
\[
26.59 - 20 = 6.59
\]

Now, the remaining amount is \$6.59. The next largest bill is a $5 bill, so we can use one $5 bill:
\[
6.59 - 5 = 1.59
\]

Now, the remaining amount is \$1.59. The next largest bill is a $1 bill, so we can use one $1 bill:
\[
1.59 - 1 = 0.59
\]

Now, the remaining amount is \$0.59. Since we cannot use any more bills, the remaining amount is in cents. Therefore, the remaining amount is 59 cents.

Thus, the number of cents that have remained after converting the largest possible denominations is \(\boxed{59}\).","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

### Step 3: Verify the solution by calculating the sums of the other rows, columns, and diagonals
Now that we have \( n = 7 \), let's substitute \( n \) back into the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Sum of the first column:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the second column:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the third column:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many fewer feet Jim travels compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha travels the perimeter of the rectangle by going along the length and the width. The length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the total distance Martha travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim travels the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that \(d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2}\). Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Jim travels \(\boxed{200}\) feet fewer than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between these points. Let's assume the distances between the points are as follows:

- \(AB = a\)
- \(AC = b\)
- \(AD = c\)
- \(BC = d\)
- \(BD = e\)
- \(CD = f\)

The problem is to find the minimum perimeter of a triangle formed by any three of these points, since the shortest path that visits all four points exactly once and returns to the starting point is equivalent to the minimum perimeter of a triangle formed by any three of the points.

We need to evaluate the perimeters of all possible triangles formed by the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\):

1. Perimeter of \(\triangle ABC = AB + BC + CA = a + d + b\)
2. Perimeter of \(\triangle ABD = AB + BD + DA = a + e + c\)
3. Perimeter of \(\triangle ACD = AC + CD + DA = b + f + c\)
