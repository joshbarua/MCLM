"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by using the given information that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of \(EF\) is 7 units. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the known value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then divide by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.**
2. **Rotate the translated \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise.**
3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.**

Let's start with the first step.

### Step 1: Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin

The complex number \( z \) is \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and the complex number \( c \) is \( 2 - 3i \). To translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin, we subtract \( c \) from \( z \):

\[
z - c = \left( (2 + \sqrt{2}) - 2 \right) + \left( -(3 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (-3) \right)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
\]

### Step 2: Rotate the translated \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise

To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counter-clockwise, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:

\[
e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Now, we multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

\[
(\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
= \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} - 3i \frac{2}{2} - 3i^2 \frac{2}{2} = 1 + i - 3i - 3(-1) = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
\]

### Step 3: Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system

Now, we translate the complex number \( 4 - 2i \) back by adding \( c \):

\[
w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 4 + 2 - 2i - 3i = 6 - 5i
\]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:

\[
\boxed{6 - 5i}

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]
\[121 \div 11 = 11\]
\[11 \div 11 = 1\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is \(2 \times 11^2\).

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor separately:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange in a circle, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" in a circle and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot x^{-6}
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \cdot x^0

\[
= \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[
= 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right)

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7. We start by substituting \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression.

First, we calculate each term in the product modulo 7:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, we substitute these congruences back into the product:
\[

\]

Next, we calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.
\]

We then find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(2\cos A\) for \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\tan A = 2

Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is equal to zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we factor it as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, we have \( c = 0 \).

Now, we need to find the sum \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To compute \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in my head, I can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Let's start by rewriting the expression in a form that might be easier to handle.

First, consider the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\). Notice that this expression is similar to the expanded form of \((x+1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1\). If we set \(x = 99\), then we can write:

\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{(99+1)^3 - 99^3}{3}

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten as:

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) for which the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[

\]

We need to compute \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

Thus, we have:

"To compute \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating the value, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating the value, we get:

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank. The problem states that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour.

We can use the chain rule to relate these rates. Differentiating the volume formula with respect to time, we get:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two parts: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of this parabola occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

Next, consider the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and if \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and \(+\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the function must cover all real values. This means that the minimum value of the parabola \(a^3\) must be less than or equal to the value of the line at \(x = a\), \(a^2 + 2a\), and the line must extend to \(-\infty\) or \(+\infty\) depending on the sign of \(a\).

If \(a > 0\), the line \(ax + 2a\) extends to \(+\infty\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), and the parabola \(ax^2\) extends to \(+\infty\) as \(x\) approaches \(\infty\). The minimum value of the parabola is \(a^3\), and it must be less than or equal to the value of the line at \(x = a\):
\[a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.\]
Factoring out \(a\) from the right-hand side, we get:
\[a^3 \leq a(a + 2).\]
Since \(a > 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[a^2 \leq a + 2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic inequality:
\[a^2 - a - 2 \leq 0.\]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.\]
The solutions to this inequality are:
\[-1 \leq a \leq 2.\]
Since \(a > 0\), the largest possible value of \(a\) is \(2\).

If \(a < 0\), the line \(ax + 2a\) extends to \(-\infty\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), and the parabola \(ax^2\) extends to \(-\infty\) as \(x\) approaches \(\infty\). The maximum value of the parabola is \(a^3\), which is negative, and it must be greater than or equal to the value of the line at \(x = a\):
\[a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a.\]
Factoring out \(a\) from the right-hand side, we get:
\[a^3 \geq a(a + 2).\]
Since \(a < 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\) and reverse the inequality:
\[a^2 \geq a + 2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic inequality:
\[a^2 - a - 2 \geq 0.\]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0.\]

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into \(f(y) = x\):
\[
f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a quartic equation in \(x\). To simplify, we can use the fact that \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) are fixed points, so they do not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions.

We can use the fact that \(f(x)\) is a quadratic function and analyze its behavior. The function \(f(x)\) has a maximum value at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution where \(f(x) \neq x\), the value \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) must be such that the function \(f\) can map some \(x\) to a value \(y\) and then map \(y\) back to \(x\). This is possible if \(\frac{\lambda}{4} > \frac{1}{2}\), which implies:
\[
\lambda > 2.
\]
However, we also need to check the range of \(f(x)\) to ensure that \(f(f(x)) = x\) is valid. The function \(f(x)\) maps \([0,1]\) to \([0, \frac{\lambda}{4}]\). For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution, \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) must be in the range of \(f(x)\), which is \([0, \frac{\lambda}{4}]\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(\lambda\) is 4.

Thus, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify \(\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator is \(\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ\).

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify \(\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator is \(-\cos 55^\circ\).

Now, we can find \(\tan \theta\):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
The angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) and is the least positive angle is \(120^\circ\). Therefore, the degree measure of the least positive angle \(\theta\) is

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we first identify the letters and their frequencies. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Here, the letter E appears twice and the letter L appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{5040}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE"" is \(\boxed{1260}\).","[1260, '1260']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",True
"To determine how many zeroes are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\), we start by considering the trigonometric substitution \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}\). This substitution is valid because the sine function maps the interval \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\) to \([-1, 1]\).

Using the substitution, the function becomes:
\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta.
\]
By the angle addition formula for sine, we have:
\[
\sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]
The maximum value of the sine function is 1, which occurs when \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi\) for any integer \(k\). Since \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}\), the only relevant solution is \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, we can choose \(\phi = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\).

The area of the triangle formed by the points \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

Given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The value \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is known to be the cosine of \( \frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). This means \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \).

In both cases, \( z^{85} = -1 \), so \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1 \). Therefore:

2. **Line through the Centroid Parallel to \( BC \):**

3. **Similarity Ratio:**
   The similarity ratio of triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the sides. Since \( G \) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, the similarity ratio is \( \frac{AG}{AD} = \frac{2}{3} \).

"To find the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

Next, perform the division to convert the fraction to a decimal:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Summing these digits, we get:
\[2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14\]

Therefore, the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True

\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. This is because if \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

\[

We use the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\). Applying these identities, we get:

\[

Substituting these into the expression, we have:

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon be \(S\). Since the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), the sum of all the interior angles \(S\) is:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   where \(x\) is the measure of the one missing interior angle.

2. **Set up the equation using the sum of the interior angles formula:**
   We know that \(S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We can estimate \(n\) by first finding the value of \(n\) if \(x\) were not present, i.e., if the sum of all interior angles were exactly \(1070^\circ\).

3. **Estimate the number of sides:**
   If we assume \(x\) is close to \(0\) (the minimum value for \(x\) in a convex polygon is greater than \(0\)), then:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round \(5.9444\) to the next whole number, which is \(6\). Therefore, \(n\) is likely \(6\).

4. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 6\), the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (6-2) \times 180^\circ = 4 \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ
   \]
   If the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), then the measure of the one missing interior angle \(x\) is:
   \[
   x = 720^\circ - 1070^\circ = -350^\circ
   \]
   This calculation shows that our initial assumption that \(x\) is close to \(0\) was incorrect. Instead, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

5. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   Let's try \(n = 7\):
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   If the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), then the measure of the one missing interior angle \(x\) is:
   \[
   x = 900^\circ - 1070^\circ = -170^\circ
   \]
   This calculation shows that our initial assumption that \(x\) is close to \(0\) was incorrect. Instead, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

6. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   Let's try \(n = 8\):
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   If the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), then the measure of the one missing interior angle \(x\) is:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the property of modular inverses. If \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, then we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, we have:

\[ t = -1 \pm 5 \]

This gives us two possible solutions:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and \( t = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \). Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

\[ t = 17 \]

To verify, we check if \( t+2 = 19 \) is the inverse of \( t = 17 \) modulo 23:

\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \]
\[ 323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Therefore, the inverse of 17 modulo 23 is indeed 19, confirming that our solution is correct. The unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our problem, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the expression inside the sine function becomes

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x).
\]

So the equation simplifies to

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}\). Applying this property, we get

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Substituting this into the expression, we have

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Now, we substitute the given values for \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\) is

"To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezoid \(ABCD\). We know that \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{CD}\) as one of its legs and \(\overline{AC}\) as the other leg. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we need to use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the base \(a\) of \(\triangle ACD\) is part of the base \(a + b\) of the trapezoid. However, we can use the area relationship directly.

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have the same height \(h\) and the base \(a\) of \(\triangle ACD\) is part of the base \(a + b\) of the trapezoid. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because the height \(h\) is the same and the base \(a\) is part of the total base \(a + b\).

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}

Next, we eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation. First, we calculate the expressions inside the square roots:

\[
\sqrt{2x} = \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}

\[
\sqrt{3x-1} = \sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1} = \sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}

Now, we substitute these back into the original equation:

\[

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circumference of the circle. The key insight is that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the order in which we list the points matters, there are \(4!\) (24) possible arrangements.

Next, we need to count the number of these arrangements where the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, these arrangements must be in an alternating pattern. There are 2 possible alternating patterns for any given pair of points \(A\) and \(B\):
1. \(A, C, B, D\)
2. \(A, D, B, C\)

For each of these patterns, the points \(C\) and \(D\) can be swapped, giving us another 2 possible arrangements:
1. \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\)
2. \(A, D, B, C\) and \(A, C, B, D\)

Thus, there are \(2\) valid arrangements for each pair of points \(A\) and \(B\). Since there are \(4\) points, there are \(4\) possible pairs of points \(A\) and \(B\). Therefore, the total number of arrangements where the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

Finally, the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements:
\[

Thus, the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so the area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The total area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle with the same central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi
\]
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of these two areas:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi + \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 5\pi

We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:

\]
We can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides of the equation:
\[

\]
Next, we cancel the 5 from both sides:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{1}{3}

Finally, we solve for \(\theta\) by multiplying both sides by 360:
\[
\theta = \frac{1}{3} \times 360^\circ = 120^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers of water it will take to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, \( r = 3 \) cm and \( h = 8 \) cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, \( r = 6 \) cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker:
\[ \text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, the expression becomes \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha)
\]

This is a product of two binomials, which can be expanded as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \sin \alpha \cos \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha

Combining like terms, we get:

\]

Notice that the terms \(\sin \alpha \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta\) and \(-\sin \alpha \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta\) cancel each other out, leaving:
\[
= \sin^2 \beta \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta
\]

We know that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\):
\[
\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84

\[
\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senate committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the committee:**
   The committee has a total of \(8 + 6 = 14\) members. The number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{14}{5}\):

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   There are 8 Republicans, so the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is \(\binom{8}{5}\):

"To find the three consecutive integers, let's denote the three integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the mean of the three integers. The mean is the sum of the integers divided by the number of integers:
\[\text{Mean} = \frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1.\]

According to the problem, the product of the three integers divided by the mean of the three integers is 24. Therefore, we can write:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24.\]

Since \(x+1 \neq 0\), we can cancel \(x+1\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[x(x+2) = 24.\]

Expanding the left side, we get:
\[x^2 + 2x = 24.\]

Rearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation, we have:
\[x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0.\]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-24\) and add up to \(2\). These numbers are \(6\) and \(-4\). Therefore, we can write:

Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:

\[x = -6 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4.\]

Since we are looking for the largest of the three consecutive integers, we choose \(x = 4\). The three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The largest of these integers is \(6\).

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x-2 = 64\)
2. \(x-2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x-2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x-2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Specifically, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression. The identity states that:

\[
\cos x \cos (60^\circ - x) \cos (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \cos 3x.
\]

We can rewrite the angles in our expression in terms of \(60^\circ\):

\[

We can pair the cosines as follows:

\[
\cos \left( 24^\circ \right) \cos \left( 96^\circ \right) \cos \left( 48^\circ \right) \cos \left( 168^\circ \right).
\]

Using the identity \(\cos (180^\circ - x) = -\cos x\), we have \(\cos \left( 168^\circ \right) = -\cos \left( 12^\circ \right)\) and \(\cos \left( 96^\circ \right) = -\cos \left( 84^\circ \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[

\cos \left( 12^\circ \right) \cos \left( 48^\circ \right) \cos \left( 84^\circ \right) \cos \left( 120^\circ - 12^\circ \right) \cos \left( 120^\circ - 48^\circ \right) \cos \left( 120^\circ - 84^\circ \right) = \frac{1}{8}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and altitude \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) with \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = 90^\circ \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

In \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{x}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB}.
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\cos \theta} \quad \text{and} \quad x = AB \sin \theta = \frac{11 \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = 11 \tan \theta.
\]
So, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + 2x = 2 \left( \frac{11}{\cos \theta} \right) + 2(11 \tan \theta) = 22 \left( \frac{1}{\cos \theta} + \tan \theta \right).
\]

Next, we use the given condition \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), \( D \) is on \( AM \) with \( AD = 10 \) and \( DM = 1 \). Using the tangent function in \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{11 \tan \theta}{1} = 11 \tan \theta \quad \text{and} \quad \tan \angle CDM = \frac{CM}{DM} = \frac{11 \tan \theta}{1} = 11 \tan \theta.
\]
Since \( \angle BDC = \angle BDM + \angle CDM \), we have:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \tan (\angle BDM + \angle CDM) = \tan (2 \cdot \angle BDM) = \frac{2 \tan \angle BDM}{1 - \tan^2 \angle BDM} = \frac{2 \cdot 11 \tan \theta}{1 - (11 \tan \theta)^2} = \frac{22 \tan \theta}{1 - 121 \tan^2 \theta}.
\]
Using the triple angle identity for tangent, we have:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3 \tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta}.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \( \tan 3\theta \), we get:
\[
\frac{3 \tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta} = \frac{22 \tan \theta}{1 - 121 \tan^2 \theta}.
\]
Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we find:
\[
(3 \tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta)(1 - 121 \tan^2 \theta) = 22 \tan \theta (1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta).
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
3 \tan \theta - 363 \tan^3 \theta - \tan^3 \theta + 121 \tan^5 \theta = 22 \tan \theta - 66 \tan^3 \theta.
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
121 \tan^5 \theta - 364 \tan^3 \theta + 3 \tan \theta = 22 \tan \theta - 66 \tan^3 \theta.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
121 \tan^5 \theta - 364 \tan^3 \theta + 66 \tan^3 \theta + 3 \tan \theta - 22 \tan \theta = 0,
\]
\[
121 \tan^5 \theta - 300 \tan^3 \theta - 19 \tan \theta = 0.
\]
Factoring out \( \tan \theta \), we get:
\[
\tan \theta (121 \tan^4 \theta - 300 \tan^2 \theta - 19) = 0.
\]
Since \( \tan \theta \neq 0 \), we have:
\[
121 \tan^4 \theta - 300 \tan^2 \theta - 19 = 0.
\]
Let \( u = \tan^2 \theta \). Then the equation becomes:
\[
121u^2 - 300u - 19 = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula \( u = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), we get:
\[
u = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 + 4 \cdot 121 \cdot 19}}{2 \cdot 121} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90000 + 9196}}{242} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{99196}}{242} = \frac{300 \pm 315}{242}.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
u = \frac{615}{242} = \frac{15}{6} = \frac{5}{2} \quad \text{(since \( u = \tan^2 \theta \) must be positive)}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\tan^2 \theta = \frac{5}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tan \theta = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.
\]
Then,
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{\tan \theta}{\sqrt{1 + \tan^2 \theta}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{5}{2}}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{\sqrt{20}}{2\sqrt{7}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{\sqrt{35}}{7}.
\]
And,
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \tan^2 \theta}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{7}.
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\cos \theta} = \frac{11}{\frac{\sqrt{14}}{7}} = \frac{77}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{77\sqrt{14}}{14} = \frac{11\sqrt{14}}{2}.
\]
And,
\[
x = 11 \tan \theta = 11 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} = \frac{11\sqrt{10}}{2}.
\]
Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
2AB + 2x = 2 \cdot \frac{11\sqrt{14}}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{11\sqrt{10}}{2} = 11\sqrt{14} + 11\sqrt{10} = 11(\sqrt{14} + \sqrt{10}).

First, we calculate \(3^7\):
\[
3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187
\]
So, the sum of the 27 consecutive positive integers is 2187.

The sum of \(n\) consecutive integers can be expressed as:

\]
For 27 consecutive integers, \(n = 27\), so the sum is:
\[

\]
We know the sum is 2187, so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times \text{median} = 2187
\]
To find the median, we divide both sides of the equation by 27:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To factor this polynomial, we can use the substitution \(y = x^2\). This gives us:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We can factor the quadratic expression as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0.\]
Since \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real \(x\), the inequality simplifies to:
\[x^2 - 3 < 0.\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
So, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's consider the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\). We can rewrite this as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0.\]
We can factor the polynomial as:
\[(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0.\]
Since \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is always non-negative and equal to zero only when \(x^2 + 2 = 0\) (which has no real solutions), the inequality \((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),

\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).

\]
Substituting the known value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 4p).
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 4p\right),

\[

"To determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of male bus riders to the number of female bus riders for each grade and then find the grade for which this ratio is closest to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus riders for each grade:
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) grade:
  - Number of male bus riders: \(0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
  - Number of female bus riders: \(0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
  - Ratio: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.044\)

- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) grade:
  - Number of male bus riders: \(0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
  - Number of female bus riders: \(0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
  - Ratio: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.04\)

- For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) grade:
  - Number of male bus riders: \(0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
  - Number of female bus riders: \(0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
  - Ratio: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) grade:

  - Number of female bus riders: \(0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
  - Ratio: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.35\)

Now, we compare the ratios to \(1.35\):
- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{th}}\) grade is \(1.044\), which is \(1.35 - 1.044 = 0.306\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{th}}\) grade is \(1.04\), which is \(1.35 - 1.04 = 0.31\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{th}}\) grade is \(1.5\), which is \(1.5 - 1.35 = 0.15\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(12^{\text{th}}\) grade is \(1.35\), which is \(1.35 - 1.35 = 0\) away from \(1.35\).

The ratio for the \(12^{\text{th}}\) grade is the closest to \(1.35\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by noting that \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\). Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can use the properties of right triangles and trigonometric identities to find \(\sin{T}\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle{R}\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\), then \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(RS\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2

\[

\[

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):

   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3 (as can be confirmed by further analysis or graphing), there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:

We need to find \( d_6 \).

In a regular octahedron, the sum of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to each pair of opposite vertices is equal. Therefore, we can write:

Next, we use the fact that \( d_2 + d_5 = 17 \):
\[ d_2 + d_5 = 7 + 11 = 18 \]

Since \( d_1 + d_6 \) must also equal 17, we can solve for \( d_6 \):
\[ d_1 + d_6 = 17 \]
\[ 3 + d_6 = 17 \]
\[ d_6 = 17 - 3 \]

\]
\[

\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We list the digits in each representation:

- Digits in base 7: \(1, 5, 6\)
- Digits in base 8: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits between the two sets are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\). There are 3 common digits.

Thus, the number of the same digits found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

"To determine the unordered set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\), we start by finding the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. That is,
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

We know that
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1S_2S_3\). We have
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product, we get
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = \alpha_1^3\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^3\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2.
\]

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can rewrite this as
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = 2(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 2(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2) + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 2(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2) + 16.
\]

We also know that
\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = (-2)^2 - 2 \cdot 0 = 4.
\]

Therefore,
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = 2 \cdot 4 + 16 = 8 + 16 = 24.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1S_2S_3 = 24\), the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 24 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(2\), \(-1 + \sqrt{3}i\), and \(-1 - \sqrt{3}i\). Therefore, the unordered set is

Next, we need to identify the last nonzero digit in the decimal expansion \(0.274\). The digits after the decimal point are \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\). The last nonzero digit in this sequence is \(4\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Let the lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) be \(2a\) and \(2b\) respectively, so that \(AB/AD = k\) implies \(2a/2b = k\) or \(a/b = k\).

The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if its distance to \(O\) is less than its distance to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
or
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
or
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:
- For vertex \(B\): \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For vertex \(C\): \(-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For vertex \(D\): \(-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

These four inequalities define a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(a/\sqrt{2}\) and \(b/\sqrt{2}\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \left(\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{ab}{2}
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\frac{\frac{ab}{2}}{4ab} = \frac{1}{8}

The remainder is the part of the number that is left over after subtracting the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than or equal to the number.

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f \) at the given points separately and then sum the results.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the definition of \( f \) for \( n < 4 \), which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the definition of \( f \) for \( n \geq 4 \), which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the definition of \( f \) for \( n \geq 4 \), which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals are equal. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we have:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
1 = n - 6
\]

Next, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
7 = n
\]

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \). To verify, we can substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the columns and diagonals.

The magic square becomes:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Let's check the sums of the columns:
- The sum of the first column is \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \).
- The sum of the second column is \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \).
- The sum of the third column is \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \).

Let's check the sums of the diagonals:
- The sum of the main diagonal is \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \).
- The sum of the other diagonal is \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \).

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
