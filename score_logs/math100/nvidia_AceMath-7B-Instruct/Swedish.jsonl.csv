"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by using the given information that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of \(EF\) is 7 units. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by dividing 7 by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the left and right sides, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To isolate \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}i}{2} + \frac{6\sqrt{2}i^2}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Combining these results, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

4. Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization. We know that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

So, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot x^{-6}

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = ((7k + 2) + 2)((7k + 2) + 4)((7k + 2) + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).
\]

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:
\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, calculate \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):
\[

\[

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions in which the pentagon looks exactly the same. The angle of rotation that maps the pentagon onto itself is given by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides of the pentagon.

For a pentagon, this calculation is:

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the solutions to \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   This means \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

   This means \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the weight of the treeks in terms of the weight of a squig.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. One treek weighs the same as one squig and one goolee:

2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig:

We can substitute the expression for \( G \) from the first equation into the second equation. From the first equation, we have:

Substitute \( G = T - S \) into the second equation:

3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\):
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the relationship between the volume of water added to the tank and the rate at which the water level rises. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. In this problem, the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the change in volume \( \Delta V \) over a small time interval \( \Delta t \) is given by:

\[ \Delta V = 20\pi \Delta t \]

and the change in height \( \Delta h \) over the same time interval is:

\[ \Delta h = 4 \Delta t \]

For a small time interval, the change in volume can also be approximated by the derivative of the volume with respect to time, which is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Given that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \), we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To solve for \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):

\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) defined as follows:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the two pieces of the function separately.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).
   - If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on \(x \geq a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
   - If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases, so it does not have a minimum value.

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).
   - If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases and decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases.
   - If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases and increases without bound as \(x\) decreases.

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the function must cover all real values. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

Since \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases when \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) will cover all real values if the minimum value of \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\).

Therefore, we need to find the largest value of \(a\) such that \(a^3 \leq 2a\).

Let's solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq 2a\):
\[ a^3 - 2a \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - 2) \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a - \sqrt{2})(a + \sqrt{2}) \leq 0 \]

The roots of the equation \(a(a - \sqrt{2})(a + \sqrt{2}) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = \sqrt{2}\), and \(a = -\sqrt{2}\). We need to test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -\sqrt{2})\), \((- \sqrt{2}, 0)\), \((0, \sqrt{2})\), and \((\sqrt{2}, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -\sqrt{2})\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - \sqrt{2})(-2 + \sqrt{2}) = (-2)(-2 - \sqrt{2})(-2 + \sqrt{2}) = (-2)(4 - 2) = -4 \leq 0\). So, the inequality is satisfied.
- For \(a \in (-\sqrt{2}, 0)\), choose \(a = -1\): \((-1)(-1 - \sqrt{2})(-1 + \sqrt{2}) = (-1)(-1 - \sqrt{2})(-1 + \sqrt{2}) = (-1)(1 - 2) = 1 \geq 0\). So, the inequality is not satisfied.
- For \(a \in (0, \sqrt{2})\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - \sqrt{2})(1 + \sqrt{2}) = (1)(1 - \sqrt{2})(1 + \sqrt{2}) = (1)(1 - 2) = -1 \leq 0\). So, the inequality is satisfied.
- For \(a \in (\sqrt{2}, \infty)\), choose \(a = 2\): \((2)(2 - \sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2}) = (2)(2 - \sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2}) = (2)(4 - 2) = 4 \geq 0\). So, the inequality is not satisfied.

Therefore, the inequality \(a^3 \leq 2a\) is satisfied for \(a \in (-\infty, -\sqrt{2}] \cup [0, \sqrt{2}]\). Since we are looking for the largest value of \(a\), we choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\). So, we need to solve the system:
\[
y = \lambda x(1 - x) \quad \text{and} \quad x = \lambda y(1 - y).
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) \implies x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) \implies x(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\)
2. \(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0\).

The first case \(x = 0\) corresponds to the fixed point \(x = 0\), which we already know. We need to consider the second case:
\[
1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Let's test the boundary values of \(x\):
- If \(x = 1\), then \(\lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda \cdot 1 + \lambda \cdot 1^2) = 0 \neq 1\). So, \(x = 1\) is not a solution.
- If \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = x\). So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, not a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Therefore, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\) has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the function and its behavior, we find that this equation has a solution for \(\lambda \in (2, 4]\). For \(\lambda \in [0, 2]\), the function \(f(f(x)) = x\) does not have a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\).

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this, we use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 40^\circ\):
\[
\tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\cos 40^\circ} = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \).

\[
e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we can rewrite the equation as:

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This can be derived from the multiple-angle formula for cosine. Since \( \cos(5\theta) = -\cos\theta \), we can see that \( 5\theta = \pi - \theta + 2k\pi \) for some integer \( k \), or \( 6\theta = \pi + 2k\pi \), which implies \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{2k\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{3} \).

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) \) because \( 85 \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \). Therefore,

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of these two numbers and then identify which of these factors are two-digit integers.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. Therefore, the common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of the product of the lowest powers of these common prime factors:

First, we find the divisors of \( 24 \). The divisors of \( 24 \) are the numbers that \( 24 \) can be divided by without leaving a remainder. We can list them by checking each number from \( 1 \) to \( 24 \):

"To determine how many nickels Hillary has, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. We know that Hillary has a total of 11 coins, all of which are dimes and nickels, and that the total value of the coins is 75 cents.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. The total number of coins is 11:
   \[
   d + n = 11
   \]
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since each dime is worth 10 cents and each nickel is worth 5 cents, we can write:
   \[
   10d + 5n = 75
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[
2d + n = 15
\]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

To eliminate \( n \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11
\]
\[
2d + n - d - n = 4
\]
\[
d = 4
\]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( n \):
\[

\[
n = 11 - 4

\[

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we first need to identify the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to determine the parity (odd or even) of each of these prime numbers. The number 2 is the only even prime number, and the numbers 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are all odd.

Now, we need to consider the different scenarios for the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse:
1. Paul chooses an even number and Jesse chooses an even number.
2. Paul chooses an odd number and Jesse chooses an odd number.
3. Paul chooses an even number and Jesse chooses an odd number.
4. Paul chooses an odd number and Jesse chooses an even number.

The sum of two even numbers is even, and the sum of two odd numbers is even. Therefore, the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse will be even if either both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.

Since there is only one even prime number (2) and five odd prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13), the probability that Paul chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\) and the probability that Paul chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\). Similarly, the probability that Jesse chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\) and the probability that Jesse chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\).

Now, we calculate the probability of each of the scenarios where the sum is even:

2. The probability that both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers is \(\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}\).

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

The diagram shows a grid with 3 columns and 4 rows, and two shaded triangles. Each small square in the grid has an area of 1 square unit. Therefore, the total area of the grid is:
\[ 3 \text{ columns} \times 4 \text{ rows} = 12 \text{ square units} \]

Now, let's focus on the two shaded triangles. The first triangle has its base along the bottom row and its height equal to the height of the grid. The base of this triangle is 2 units (since it spans 2 columns) and its height is 4 units (since it spans the entire height of the grid). The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
So, the area of the first triangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units} \]

The second triangle has its base along the bottom row and its height equal to the height of the grid. The base of this triangle is 3 units (since it spans 3 columns) and its height is 4 units (since it spans the entire height of the grid). Therefore, the area of the second triangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units} \]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:
\[ \text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_1 + \text{Area}_2 = 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ square units} \]

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we need to consider the properties of the number 450. The number 450 can be factored into its prime factors as follows:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]
This means that any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.

First, let's consider the divisibility rules for each of these factors:
1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Since the only even digits are 0 and 1, the last digit of our number must be 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are either 00 or 25. Since the only digits allowed are 0 and 1, the last two digits of our number must be 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since the only digits allowed are 0 and 1, the sum of the digits of our number must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, the number must contain exactly 9 ones.

Combining these conditions, the smallest number that meets all these criteria is the number with exactly 9 ones followed by two zeros. This number is:
\[ 11111111100 \]

To verify, let's check the divisibility:
- The number ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
- The sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\), so it is divisible by 9.
- The number ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.

\[2^8 = 256\]

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x)\) can be simplified as follows:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Let \(x = 20^\circ\), then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

"To calculate the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these expressions back into the original sum:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]
Combine the constant terms:
\[
= 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\):
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

To find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\tan^2 20^\circ\), and \(\tan^2 40^\circ\), we use the triple angle identity for tangent:
\[
\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}.
\]
For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 10^\circ\), but we don't need to solve it explicitly. Instead, we use known values and properties of tangent to find the sum of the squares of the tangents.

Using known results from trigonometry, we have:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 9.

   If the sum of all but one interior angle is \(1070^\circ\), then the sum of all interior angles is \(1070^\circ\) plus the measure of the one missing angle. Let's denote the measure of the missing angle by \(x\). Therefore, the sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all interior angles is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must be less than \(180^\circ\).

5. **Find the possible value of \(n\):**
   We need to find \(n\) such that the sum of all interior angles is slightly more than \(1070^\circ\) but less than \(1250^\circ\) (since \(1070^\circ + 180^\circ = 1250^\circ\)). Let's test the values of \(n\):

   - For \(n = 8\):
     \[
     (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
     \]
     This is greater than \(1070^\circ\) but less than \(1250^\circ\), so it is a possible value.

   - For \(n = 7\):
     \[
     (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
     \]
     This is less than \(1070^\circ\), so it is not a possible value.

   - For \(n = 9\):
     \[
     (9-2) \times 180^\circ = 7 \times 180^\circ = 1260^\circ
     \]
     This is greater than \(1250^\circ\), so it is not a possible value.

Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is \(8\).

The number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence equation \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find this square root:
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]
Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have two possible solutions: \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). However, 4 is even, so the only odd solution is \( t = 17 \).

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is \(\boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True
"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

   The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:

   V = s^3

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 25 - 3 = 22

2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Finally, evaluate \( g \) at the result from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the rectangle defined by the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the boundaries of the rectangle:**
   - The horizontal boundaries are \(x = -5\) and \(x = 5\).
   - The vertical boundaries are \(y = -4\) and \(y = 4\).

2. **Determine the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values for points strictly inside the rectangle:**
   - For \(x\), the values must be strictly between \(-5\) and \(5\), so \(x\) ranges from \(-4\) to \(4\).
   - For \(y\), the values must be strictly between \(-4\) and \(4\), so \(y\) ranges from \(-3\) to \(3\).

3. **Count the integer points within these ranges:**

   - Therefore, the total number of points is \(9 \times 7 = 63\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{z}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times (\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{z} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{z}.

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

"To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezoid \(ABCD\). We know that \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{CD}\) as one of its legs and \(\overline{AC}\) as the other leg. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we need to use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the base \(a\) of \(\triangle ACD\) is part of the base \(a + b\) of the trapezoid. However, we can use the area relationship directly.

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have the same height \(h\) and the base \(a\) of \(\triangle ACD\) is part of the base \(a + b\) of the trapezoid. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because the height \(h\) is the same and the base \(a\) is part of the total base \(a + b\).

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the order of selection does not matter, we can fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in the remaining positions.

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with the same central angle \(\theta\) is:

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of these two sectors:

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical barrel. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical barrel, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2

\[

\[

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee with 5 members that includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists entirely of members from one party.

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 republicans and 6 democrats):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that consists entirely of republicans. There are 8 republicans, so:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that consists entirely of democrats. There are 6 democrats, so:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Now, add the number of ways to form a subcommittee entirely of republicans and entirely of democrats:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, subtract this sum from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members to get the number of ways to form a subcommittee with at least one member from each party:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

Thus, the number of ways to form a subcommittee with 5 members that has at least one member from each party is:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trial and error or by estimating. Let's try some values:

If \(x = 4\):
\[4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120.\]
This works, so the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6.

Now, we need to check the second part of the problem, which states that the product of the three integers divided by their mean is 24. The mean of the three integers is:
\[\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1.\]
For \(x = 4\), the mean is:
\[4 + 1 = 5.\]
The product of the three integers is 120, so the product divided by the mean is:
\[\frac{120}{5} = 24.\]
This also works, confirming that our solution is correct.

The largest of the three consecutive integers is \(x+2\), which is:

"To solve for the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

Since we are asked for the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \) and keep \( x = 66 \).

"To solve for the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\).
   - The height \(AM = 11\).
   - Point \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\).
   - \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

2. **Define the angles:**
   - Let \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta\).

3. **Use the tangent function:**
   - In \(\triangle AMB\), \(\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11}\).
   - Therefore, \(BM = 11 \tan \theta\).

4. **Determine the coordinates of points:**
   - Place \(M\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Place \(A\) at \((0, 11)\).
   - Place \(B\) at \((-11 \tan \theta, 0)\).
   - Place \(C\) at \((11 \tan \theta, 0)\).

5. **Find the coordinates of point \(D\):**
   - Since \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) and \(AD = 10\), \(D\) is at \((0, 1)\).

6. **Calculate the slopes of \(\overline{BD}\) and \(\overline{CD}\):**
   - Slope of \(\overline{BD}\) is \(\frac{1 - 0}{0 - (-11 \tan \theta)} = \frac{1}{11 \tan \theta}\).
   - Slope of \(\overline{CD}\) is \(\frac{1 - 0}{0 - 11 \tan \theta} = -\frac{1}{11 \tan \theta}\).

7. **Use the tangent addition formula for \(\angle BDC\):**
   - \(\tan \angle BDC = \left| \frac{\frac{1}{11 \tan \theta} - \left(-\frac{1}{11 \tan \theta}\right)}{1 + \left(\frac{1}{11 \tan \theta}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{11 \tan \theta}\right)} \right| = \left| \frac{\frac{2}{11 \tan \theta}}{1 - \frac{1}{121 \tan^2 \theta}} \right| = \left| \frac{22 \tan \theta}{121 \tan^2 \theta - 1} \right|\).
   - Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC = 6\theta\), \(\tan 6\theta = \frac{22 \tan \theta}{121 \tan^2 \theta - 1}\).

8. **Solve for \(\tan \theta\):**
   - Using the triple angle identity for tangent, \(\tan 6\theta = \frac{6 \tan \theta - 20 \tan^3 \theta + 4 \tan^5 \theta}{1 - 15 \tan^2 \theta + 15 \tan^4 \theta - \tan^6 \theta}\).
   - Equate the two expressions for \(\tan 6\theta\) and solve for \(\tan \theta\). After solving, we find \(\tan \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\).

9. **Find the length of \(BM\):**
   - \(BM = 11 \tan \theta = 11 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}\).

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. Given that the sum is \(3^7\), we first calculate \(3^7\):

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

The sum of 27 consecutive positive integers can be expressed as the sum of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \(a\) and the common difference is 1. The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)
\]

For our sequence, \(n = 27\), \(d = 1\), and \(S = 2187\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
2187 = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26)
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:

\[
2187 = \frac{27}{2} \cdot 2 (a + 13) = 27(a + 13)
\]

Next, we solve for \(a\):

\[
2187 = 27(a + 13) \implies a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81 \implies a = 81 - 13 = 68

So, the first term \(a\) is 68. The 27 consecutive integers are:

\[
68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94, 95

The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. To find the 14th term, we use the formula for the \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[
a_k = a + (k-1)d

For the 14th term, \(k = 14\):

\[
a_{14} = 68 + (14-1) \cdot 1 = 68 + 13 = 81

"To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) holds, we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ (x^2)^2 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), the absolute value can be removed:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:
\[ -2 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \) is always non-negative, the left part of the inequality \( -2 < x^2 \) is always true. Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:
\[ x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given that \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we can solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearrange to get
\[-8 + 36 = \frac{1728}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[28 = \frac{1728}{p^3}.\]
Solving for \(p^3\), we get
\[p^3 = \frac{1728}{28} = \frac{432}{7}.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

However, we need to check if this value is consistent with the original equations. Instead, we can use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try to find a simpler solution.

"To determine for which year the number of male bus riders is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders, we need to calculate the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders for each year and then find the year where this ratio is closest to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus riders for each year:

1. **9th year:**
   - Number of male bus riders: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Number of female bus riders: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2\)

   - Number of female bus riders: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.04\)

3. **11th year:**
   - Number of male bus riders: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Number of female bus riders: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

4. **12th year:**
   - Number of male bus riders: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Number of female bus riders: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.35\)

Now, we compare the ratios to \(1.35\):
- For the 9th year, the ratio is \(1.044\), which is \(1.35 - 1.044 = 0.306\) away from \(1.35\).
- For the 10th year, the ratio is \(1.04\), which is \(1.35 - 1.04 = 0.31\) away from \(1.35\).
- For the 11th year, the ratio is \(1.5\), which is \(1.5 - 1.35 = 0.15\) away from \(1.35\).
- For the 12th year, the ratio is \(1.35\), which is \(1.35 - 1.35 = 0\) away from \(1.35\).

The ratio for the 12th year is exactly \(1.35\), so the number of male bus riders is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders in the 12th year.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the expression \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the running track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles at the ends. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) meters and the width by \( W \) meters. The two semicircles at the ends form a full circle with a diameter equal to the width \( W \) of the rectangle. The circumference of this circle is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to maximize the area \( A \) of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]

From the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W \implies L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}

To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:

\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100
\]

The area of the rectangle is then:
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2.

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x^2 + 4 = 25
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 21

   \[
   x = \sqrt{21}
   \]
   So, the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) is \(\sqrt{21}\).

3. **Determine \(\sin{T}\):**
   In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side to that angle divided by the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is the adjacent side to angle \(R\), which is \(\sqrt{21}\), and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, we have:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance \(d\) from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((x, y)\) is given by the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute this into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]
Next, we expand and simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]
The minimum distance can be expressed as \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we have \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\). Thus, the answer is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors: \( x = 0 \) and \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution. Testing other possible rational roots or using numerical methods would show that there are no other real roots greater than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

The answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by considering the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has eight vertices, twelve edges, and six faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between any two opposite vertices is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \) such that \( A_1 \) is opposite to \( A_4 \), \( A_2 \) is opposite to \( A_5 \), and \( A_3 \) is opposite to \( A_6 \).

Without loss of generality, assume the distances from \( P \) to \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, respectively. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to \( A_6 \).

In a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant and equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center. However, for simplicity, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \) is constant.

Let \( d \) be the distance from \( P \) to \( A_6 \). Then, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d^2 = \text{constant}
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[
3^2 = 9, \quad 7^2 = 49, \quad 8^2 = 64, \quad 9^2 = 81, \quad 11^2 = 121
\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
324 + d^2 = \text{constant}
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is constant, the value of \( d^2 \) must be such that the sum remains constant. Therefore, the distance \( d \) must be the same as one of the other distances to maintain the symmetry and regularity of the octahedron.

Given the distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, the only distance that fits the pattern and maintains the symmetry is 6. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine how many of the same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[

\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,

\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

Next, we calculate the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We start by expressing \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:

S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).

\[
S_1 = e^{i\pi/4}e^{-i\pi/4} + e^{3i\pi/4}e^{-3i\pi/4} = 1 + 1 = 2,

\[
S_2 = e^{i\pi/4}e^{3i\pi/4} + e^{-i\pi/4}e^{-3i\pi/4} = e^{i\pi} + e^{-i\pi} = -1 + (-1) = -2,

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
" för att bestämma hur mycket pengar kvar blivde efter att de växlat mynten till sedlar, behöver vi först räkna ut den totala summan av pengar som Linda, Sherry, June och Connie samlade ihop.

1. **Beräkna den totala summan:**
   - Linda: $27.47
   - Sherry: $35.23
   - June: $37.37
   - Connie: $26.52

   Vi adderar dessa belopptill:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Vi adderar dem stegvis:
   - \(27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70\)
   - \(62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07\)
   - \(100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59\)

   Så den totala summan är:
   \[
   126.59
   \]

2. **Convert till cent:**
   Vi multiplicerar den totala summan med 100 för att omvandla till cent:
   \[
   126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cent}

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we have:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
1 = n - 6
\]

Next, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
7 = n
\]

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \). To verify, we can substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the columns and diagonals.

The magic square becomes:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Let's check the sums of the columns:
- The sum of the first column is \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \).
- The sum of the second column is \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \).
- The sum of the third column is \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \).

Let's check the sums of the diagonals:
- The sum of the main diagonal is \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \).
- The sum of the other diagonal is \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \).

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Jim travels compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally across the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha goes along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is:
\[
300 + 400 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore, Jim travels \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
