"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating the complex number \( z \) around the complex number \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 1 + i - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"".** This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

2. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.** There are 3 people in the block, and they can be arranged among themselves in \(3! = 6\) ways.

3. **Combine the two results.** The total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" in a circle and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To solve the problem, we start with the given condition \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). This means that \( n \) can be written in the form \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).

We need to find the remainder when the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7. Let's substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) into the expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (7k + 2 + 2)(7k + 2 + 4)(7k + 2 + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

Since we are interested in the remainder when this expression is divided by 7, we can simplify each term modulo 7:

\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24
\]

Now, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

So, \( 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \). Therefore, the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine how many degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to match its initial position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions in which the pentagon looks exactly the same. The smallest angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full rotation) by the number of sides of the pentagon.

Here are the steps to find the minimal angle of rotation:

1. Identify the number of sides of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has 5 sides.
2. Divide 360 degrees by the number of sides to find the minimal angle of rotation.

The calculation is as follows:
\[
\text{Minimal angle of rotation} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Therefore, the minimal number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to match its initial position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

Next, let's denote the coordinates of the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\) should be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From this, we can set up the following system of equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means there must be another possible configuration of the parallelogram. Let's consider the other diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) should be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From this, we can set up the following system of equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). Since \(x > 7\) is not satisfied, this configuration is not valid. Let's consider the other diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) should be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From this, we can set up the following system of equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\) is satisfied, this configuration is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and we are dealing with a right triangle where \(\angle A\) is not \(90^\circ\)), we can simplify the expression by canceling \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\tan A = 2

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
   \[
   f(7) = \frac{2 \cdot 7}{7^2 - 5 \cdot 7 - 14} = \frac{14}{49 - 35 - 14} = \frac{14}{0} \quad \text{(undefined)}
   \]
   \[
   f(-2) = \frac{2 \cdot (-2)}{(-2)^2 - 5 \cdot (-2) - 14} = \frac{-4}{4 + 10 - 14} = \frac{-4}{0} \quad \text{(undefined)}
   \]
   Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials of degrees \( n \) and \( m \) respectively, depends on the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \):
   - If \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
   - If \( n = m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \).
   - If \( n > m \), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).
   In our function, \( P(x) = 2x \) and \( Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14 \). The degree of \( P(x) \) is 1 and the degree of \( Q(x) \) is 2. Since \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Let's start by rewriting the expression in a form that might be easier to work with.

First, consider the expression \(x^2 + x + 1\). We can rewrite this expression by adding and subtracting 1:
\[x^2 + x + 1 = (x^2 + x + \frac{1}{4}) + \frac{3}{4} = \left(x + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}.\]
However, this form is not immediately helpful for our specific value of \(x = 99\).

Instead, let's use another approach. Notice that \(x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)\). Therefore, we can express \(x^2 + x + 1\) as:
\[x^2 + x + 1 = \frac{x^3 - 1}{x - 1}.\]
For \(x = 99\), this becomes:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1} = \frac{99^3 - 1}{98}.\]

Now, we need to calculate \(99^3\):
\[99^3 = 99 \times 99 \times 99 = 9801 \times 99 = 970299.\]
So,
\[99^3 - 1 = 970299 - 1 = 970298.\]
Therefore,
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{970298}{98}.\]

To simplify \(\frac{970298}{98}\), we can perform the division:
\[970298 \div 98 = 9901.\]
Thus, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{9901}\).","[9901, '9901']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",True

\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The weight of ten trees is equal to the weight of three skvygas and one gulis.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this polynomial must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
   \]
   This matches.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), so we have:
   \[
   -2(-3) = 6

   This matches.

Thus, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

\[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level rises. The volume of water added to the tank per unit time is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank multiplied by the rate at which the water level rises.

Given:
- The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour.
- The water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour.

The formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the water in the tank.

The rate of change of the volume with respect to time is:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know that \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) cubic meters per hour and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\) meters per hour. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To solve for \(r^2\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\):
\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of the function \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function piecewise.

The function is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first piece \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Domain**: \( x \geq a \)
2. **Behavior**: This is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).
3. **Minimum/Maximum**: The vertex occurs at \( x = a \):
   - If \( a > 0 \), the minimum value is \( f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \).
   - If \( a < 0 \), the maximum value is \( f(a) = a^3 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the second piece \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Domain**: \( x < a \)
2. **Behavior**: This is a linear function.
3. **Slope**: The slope is \( a \).
   - If \( a > 0 \), the function is increasing.
   - If \( a < 0 \), the function is decreasing.

### Step 3: Determine the range of \( f(x) \)

1. **For \( x \geq a \)**:
   - If \( a > 0 \), the range is \( [a^3, \infty) \).
   - If \( a < 0 \), the range is \( (-\infty, a^3] \).

2. **For \( x < a \)**:
   - If \( a > 0 \), the range is \( (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \).
   - If \( a < 0 \), the range is \( (a^2 + 2a, \infty) \).

### Step 4: Combine the ranges

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - The combined range is \( (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \cup [a^3, \infty) \).
   - For the graph to intersect every horizontal line, the ranges must cover all real numbers. This requires \( a^2 + 2a \geq a^3 \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - The combined range is \( (a^2 + 2a, \infty) \cup (-\infty, a^3] \).
   - For the graph to intersect every horizontal line, the ranges must cover all real numbers. This requires \( a^2 + 2a \leq a^3 \).

### Step 5: Solve the inequalities

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - Solve \( a^2 + 2a \geq a^3 \):
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \implies a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.
     \]
     The roots are \( a = 0, 2, -1 \). Testing intervals:
     - For \( a \in (0, 2) \), the inequality holds.
     - Thus, \( 0 < a \leq 2 \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - Solve \( a^2 + 2a \leq a^3 \):
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0 \implies a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0.
     \]
     The roots are \( a = 0, 2, -1 \). Testing intervals:
     - For \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \), the inequality holds.
     - Thus, \( a \leq -1 \).

### Step 6: Determine the largest \( a \)

"To find the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x \implies x(\lambda(1 - x) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda(1 - x) - 1 = 0 \implies x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda > 1\)).

Next, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\), so \(y\) is a fixed point of \(f\). Therefore, \(y\) must be either 0 or \(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

**Case 1: \(y = 0\)**

If \(y = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\). The solutions to \(f(x) = 0\) are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1.
\]
For \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), we have \(f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0\) or \(f(f(x)) = f(1) = 0\), respectively. However, \(f(x) = x\) for both \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\), so these solutions do not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\).

**Case 2: \(y = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\)**

If \(y = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), then \(f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\). The solutions to \(f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) are:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda^2 x(1 - x) = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
The solutions to this quadratic equation are:
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \sqrt{\lambda^4 - 4\lambda^2(\lambda - 1)}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \sqrt{\lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{\lambda} + \frac{4}{\lambda^2}}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda^2 \left|1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right|}{2\lambda^2}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \left|1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right|}{2}.
\]
We need to consider two sub-cases based on the value of \(\lambda\):

- If \(\lambda \ge 2\), then \(\left|1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right| = 1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\), so the solutions are:
  \[
  x = \frac{1 + 1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}}{2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{1 - 1 + \frac{2}{\lambda}}{2} = \frac{1}{\lambda}.
  \]
  For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we have \(f(x) = x\), so this solution does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\). For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we have \(f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), so this solution satisfies \(f(x) \neq x\). We also need to check if \(f(f(x)) = x\):
  \[
  f\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \frac{1}{\lambda} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
  \]
  Therefore, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

- If \(\lambda < 2\), then \(\left|1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right| = \frac{2}{\lambda} - 1\), so the solutions are:
  \[
  x = \frac{1 + \frac{2}{\lambda} - 1}{2} = \frac{1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{1 - \frac{2}{\lambda} + 1}{2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
  \]
  For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we have \(f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), so this solution satisfies \(f(x) \neq x\). We also need to check if \(f(f(x)) = x\):
  \[
  f\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \frac{1}{\lambda} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
  \]
  Therefore, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\).

In both cases, we see that \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\) if \(\lambda \ge 2\). Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan(A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to simplify this expression. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we get:
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,

\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.

Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

The maximum value of the sine function is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only relevant solution is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]

So, the cross product is \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\). The magnitude of this vector is:

\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and thus the given equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, we know that \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, we can deduce that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and using properties of the centroid and similar triangles.

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Determine the area of triangle \( AGC \):**
   Since \( G \) divides the median \( AD \) in the ratio 2:1, the area of triangle \( AGC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the area of triangle \( ADC \). Similarly, the area of triangle \( ADC \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \) because \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( AGC \) is:

   Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and \( G \) divides \( AD \) in the ratio 2:1, the triangles \( ENG \) and \( AGC \) are similar with a similarity ratio of \( \frac{1}{3} \) (because \( EG \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( AG \)). The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is:

"To determine what fraction of the remaining books on the three shelves are mathematics books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books remaining after two books are taken from each shelf.
2. Determine the number of mathematics books remaining.
3. Calculate the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of books remaining after two books are taken from each shelf.**

The total number of books on all three shelves initially is 24. Since two books are taken from each shelf, the number of books taken in total is:
\[ 2 \text{ books/shelf} \times 3 \text{ shelves} = 6 \text{ books} \]

Therefore, the total number of books remaining is:

**Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books.**

The fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of mathematics books remaining}}{\text{Total number of books remaining}} = \frac{8}{18} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where \(a_1\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general form of the \(n\)-th term, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common divisors of these two numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. The smallest power of these common prime factors is \(2^1\) and \(5^2\). Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:

Taking the \( n \)-th root of both sides, we get:

"To determine how many five-cent coins Hillary has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
   - Let \( p \) be the number of five-cent coins.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Each dime is worth 10 cents, so the total value of the dimes is \( 10d \) cents.
   - Each five-cent coin is worth 5 cents, so the total value of the five-cent coins is \( 5p \) cents.
   - The total value of all the coins is 75 cents, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     10d + 5p = 75
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Divide every term in the equation by 5 to simplify:
     \[
     2d + p = 15
     \]

4. **Solve for \( p \):**
   - Isolate \( p \) on one side of the equation:
     \[
     p = 15 - 2d
     \]

5. **Determine the Possible Values for \( d \):**
   - Since \( d \) and \( p \) must be non-negative integers, \( d \) can take any integer value from 0 to 7 (because if \( d = 8 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 8 = -1 \), which is not a valid number of coins).
   - However, we need to find the specific value of \( p \) that satisfies the equation.

6. **Check the Values:**
   - If \( d = 0 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 0 = 15 \).
   - If \( d = 1 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 1 = 13 \).
   - If \( d = 2 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 2 = 11 \).
   - If \( d = 3 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 \).
   - If \( d = 4 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 4 = 7 \).
   - If \( d = 5 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 5 = 5 \).
   - If \( d = 6 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 6 = 3 \).
   - If \( d = 7 \), then \( p = 15 - 2 \cdot 7 = 1 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of five-cent coins Hillary has is \( p = 15 - 2d \). Since the problem does not specify the exact number of dimes, the number of five-cent coins can be any of the values 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, or 1. However, the problem asks for the number of five-cent coins, and without additional information, we can only express it in terms of \( d \).

The number of five-cent coins Hillary has is \(\boxed{15}\) if she has no dimes, but the general answer is \( p = 15 - 2d \). If we assume the problem is asking for a specific solution, we need more information. However, based on the problem statement, the most straightforward interpretation is that the number of five-cent coins is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",7,"[7, '7']",False

Since Paulius and Džesis each choose a number randomly from the first six prime numbers, there are \(6 \times 6 = 36\) possible outcomes. We need to determine how many of these outcomes result in a sum that is one of the unique sums listed above.

We will count the number of pairs that sum to each unique sum:

- Sum = 16: (3, 13) and (13, 3) and (5, 11) and (11, 5) - 4 pairs
- Sum = 18: (5, 13) and (13, 5) and (7, 11) and (11, 7) - 4 pairs
- Sum = 20: (7, 13) and (13, 7) - 2 pairs

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the form described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in Cartesian coordinates. Recall that the relationship between cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) and Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) is given by:

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

\[ z = c. \]

This equation describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a constant height \(c\) along the \(z\)-axis. Therefore, the form described by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the properties of the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.

Now, substitute these rewritten forms back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]

Combine the constant terms:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.

"To determine the number of sides of a regular polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the sum of the interior angles of the polygon be \(S\). Since the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), the sum of all interior angles \(S\) is:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + \text{(one interior angle)}
   \]
   The measure of one interior angle of a regular polygon with \(n\) sides is:
   \[
   \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
   \]
   Therefore, the sum of all interior angles \(S\) can also be written as:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
   \]

2. **Eliminate the fraction by multiplying through by \(n\):**
   \[
   n \times (n-2) \times 180^\circ = n \times 1070^\circ + (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   n^2 \times 180^\circ - 2n \times 180^\circ = n \times 1070^\circ + n \times 180^\circ - 2 \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Combine like terms on the right side:
   \[
   n^2 \times 180^\circ - 2n \times 180^\circ = n \times 1250^\circ - 360^\circ
   \]
   Move all terms to one side of the equation:
   \[
   n^2 \times 180^\circ - 2n \times 180^\circ - n \times 1250^\circ + 360^\circ = 0
   \]
   Factor out \(n\) from the terms involving \(n\):
   \[
   n^2 \times 180^\circ - n(2 \times 180^\circ + 1250^\circ) + 360^\circ = 0
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[

   \]
   This is a quadratic equation in the form \(an^2 + bn + c = 0\), where \(a = 180\), \(b = -1610\), and \(c = 360\). We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
   \[
   n = \frac{1610 \pm \sqrt{(-1610)^2 - 4 \times 180 \times 360}}{2 \times 180}

   Calculate the discriminant:
   \[
   (-1610)^2 = 2592100

   \[
   4 \times 180 \times 360 = 259200
   \]
   \[
   2592100 - 259200 = 2332900
   \]
   So, the quadratic formula becomes:
   \[
   n = \frac{1610 \pm \sqrt{2332900}}{360}
   \]
   Simplify the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{2332900} = 1527
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   n = \frac{1610 \pm 1527}{360}
   \]
   This gives us two potential solutions:
   \[
   n = \frac{1610 + 1527}{360} = \frac{3137}{360} \approx 8.714 \quad \text{(not an integer)}

   \[
   n = \frac{1610 - 1527}{360} = \frac{83}{360} \approx 0.2306 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
   \]
   Since neither solution is an integer, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the sum of the interior angles directly:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}

   Multiply through by \(n\):
   \[
   n \times (n-2) \times 180^\circ = n \times 1070^\circ + (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   n^2 \times 180^\circ - 2n \times 180^\circ = n \times 1070^\circ + n \times 180^\circ - 2 \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   n^2 \times 180^\circ - 2n \times 180^\circ = n \times 1250^\circ - 360^\circ

   Move all terms to one side:
   \[
   n^2 \times 180^\circ - 2n \times 180^\circ - n \times 1250^\circ + 360^\circ = 0

   Factor out \(n\):
   \[
   n^2 \times 180^\circ - n(2 \times 180^\circ + 1250^\circ) + 360^\circ = 0

   Simplify:

"To find the unique non-negative integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:

\[
t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging gives us a quadratic congruence:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

To solve this, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Thus, we have:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find \( \sqrt{8} \mod 23 \). We can express \( 8 \) as \( 2^3 \), and we need to find \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

Calculating \( 8 \mod 23 \) gives us \( 8 \). We can check the squares of integers from \( 1 \) to \( 11 \) (since \( 12^2 \equiv 11^2 \mod 23 \)):

- \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( 4^2 = 16 \)
- \( 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \)
- \( 6^2 = 36 \equiv 13 \)
- \( 7^2 = 49 \equiv 3 \)
- \( 8^2 = 64 \equiv 18 \)
- \( 9^2 = 81 \equiv 12 \)
- \( 10^2 = 100 \equiv 8 \)
- \( 11^2 = 121 \equiv 6 \)

We find that \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \). Thus, \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \) or \( -10 \equiv 13 \).

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad t = \frac{-2 \pm 13}{2}

Calculating these gives:

1. For \( t = \frac{-2 + 10}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \)
2. For \( t = \frac{-2 - 10}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6 \) (not valid since \( t > 0 \))
3. For \( t = \frac{-2 + 13}{2} = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \) (not valid since \( t \) must be an integer)

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

   - The width of the rectangle along the y-axis is from \(-4\) to \(4\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the properties of the cross product. The cross product is distributive over vector addition, so we can expand the expression as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezium \(ABCD\) where \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). The area of the trapezium is given as 42. We need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezium as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezium is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of the trapezium \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the base of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(a\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) is also the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

We can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) and \(h\) using the area of the trapezium:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. Therefore, the ratio of the bases \(BC\) and \(CD\) is equal to the ratio of the other corresponding sides. However, we can directly use the fact that the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezium minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\).

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezium:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose and arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the points.

Next, we need to count the number of these permutations where the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern. There are 2 possible alternating patterns for any given pair of points \(A\) and \(B\):
1. \(A, C, B, D\)
2. \(A, D, B, C\)

For each pair of points \(A\) and \(B\), there are 2 possible choices for the points \(C\) and \(D\) that will result in an intersection. Since there are \(4\) points, there are \(4\) choices for \(A\) and \(3\) choices for \(B\) (after \(A\) is chosen), and then \(2\) choices for the pair \((C, D)\). However, since the order of choosing \(A\) and \(B\) does not matter, we need to divide by 2. Therefore, the number of favorable permutations is:
\[
\frac{4 \times 3 \times 2}{2} = 12

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable permutations to the total number of permutations:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \( \angle ADC \) given that the area of the sector formed by the smaller circle is \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so the area is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

Next, we calculate the area of the smaller circle. The radius of the smaller circle is 1, so the area is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the sector is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]
where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees and \( r \) is the radius of the circle. For the smaller circle, the radius \( r \) is 1, so the area of the sector is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi
\]

Setting this equal to the area of the sector we calculated earlier, we get:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

We can cancel \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

To solve for \( \theta \), we multiply both sides by 360:
\[
\theta = \frac{5}{3} \times 360^\circ = 600^\circ
\]

However, since \( \theta \) must be less than 360 degrees (as it is an angle in a circle), we need to find the equivalent angle within one full rotation. The angle \( \theta \) is actually the angle that is not part of the sector, so the smaller angle \( \angle ADC \) is:
\[
\angle ADC = 360^\circ - 600^\circ = 120^\circ

Therefore, the measure of the smaller angle \( \angle ADC \) is:

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical measuring cup. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical measuring cup, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical bowl. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical bowl, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical measuring cups are needed to fill the spherical bowl, we divide the volume of the spherical bowl by the volume of one cylindrical measuring cup:
\[ \text{Number of cups} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

     \[
     \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

So the equation becomes:

First, we note that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), so \(BM = MC = \frac{a}{2}\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle AMB\), we have:
\[
b^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]
Thus,
\[
b^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\). Since \(D\) is on the altitude \(AM\), \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ - 3\theta\) and \(\angle MDC = 90^\circ - 3\theta\).

Using the tangent function in \(\triangle BDM\) and \(\triangle MDC\), we have:

We also know that:
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\tan\theta - \tan^3\theta}{1 - 3\tan^2\theta}.
\]
Since \(\tan\theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{\frac{a}{2}}{11} = \frac{a}{22}\), we substitute this into the tangent triple angle formula:
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\left(\frac{a}{22}\right) - \left(\frac{a}{22}\right)^3}{1 - 3\left(\frac{a}{22}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3a}{22} - \frac{a^3}{10648}}{1 - \frac{3a^2}{484}} = \frac{\frac{3a \cdot 484 - a^3}{10648}}{\frac{484 - 3a^2}{484}} = \frac{1452a - a^3}{10648} \cdot \frac{484}{484 - 3a^2} = \frac{1452a - a^3}{22(484 - 3a^2)}.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\tan(3\theta)\), we get:
\[
\frac{a}{2} = \frac{1452a - a^3}{22(484 - 3a^2)}.
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
11a(484 - 3a^2) = 1452a - a^3.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
5324a - 33a^3 = 1452a - a^3 \implies 3872a = 32a^3 \implies 121 = a^2 \implies a = 11.

\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), we can simplify this to:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:
\[ -2 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies further to:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use the identity for the sum of cubes and some algebraic manipulation.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this expression in terms of symmetric sums:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the equation, we get:
\[12 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[24 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
\[24 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p) = s(s^2 - 4p),\]
\[24 = sp.\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right) = \frac{24}{p} \left(\frac{576}{p^2} - 4p\right) = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 4p^3}{p^2} = \frac{24(576 - 4p^3)}{p^3}.\]
This simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{24 \cdot 576 - 96p^3}{p^3} = \frac{13824 - 96p^3}{p^3} = \frac{13824}{p^3} - 96.\]
Rearrange to solve for \(p^3\):
\[96 - 8 = \frac{13824}{p^3},\]
\[88 = \frac{13824}{p^3},\]
\[88p^3 = 13824,\]
\[p^3 = \frac{13824}{88} = 156.81818181818182,\]

3. Find the class where the number of boys važiuojančių autobusu is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls važiuojančių autobusu.

Let's start with the calculations:

### Class \(9^{\mathrm{a}}\)

### Class \(10^{\mathrm{a}}\)
- Number of boys važiuojančių autobusu: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103\)
- Number of girls važiuojančių autobusu: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\)

- Number of girls važiuojančių autobusu: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
- \(135\%\) of the number of girls važiuojančių autobusu: \(135\% \times 41 = 55.35 \approx 55\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero.

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the denominator in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

In boxed form, the answer is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular field, we need to analyze the given information and the shape of the sports field. The field is a rectangle with two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The total length of the field, which is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles, is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the straight side of the rectangle by \( L \) meters and the width (which is also the diameter of the semicircles) by \( W \) meters. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi W \), so the circumferences of two semicircles together are \( \pi W \).

The total length of the field can be expressed as:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We need to maximize the area \( A \) of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]

From the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \), we can solve for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ 2L = 400 - \pi W \]
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W \]
\[ A = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( W \), and it opens downwards (since the coefficient of \( W^2 \) is negative). The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -\frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( b = 200 \), so the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area is:
\[ W = -\frac{200}{2 \left( -\frac{\pi}{2} \right)} = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \), we get:
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \]

Now, we can calculate the maximum area \( A \):
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Therefore, the maximum possible area of the rectangular field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is \(2\).

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the graph \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Next, we expand and simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero to find the critical points:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In this form, \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we have:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center.

However, for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is also equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the opposite vertices. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices.

Let the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex be \( x \). Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is constant, we can write:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

We can also write:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = (3^2 + 11^2) + (7^2 + 9^2) + (8^2 + x^2)
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices is equal, we can pair the distances:
\[
3^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 121 = 130
\]
\[
7^2 + 9^2 = 49 + 81 = 130
\]

Therefore, we have:
\[
130 + 130 + (8^2 + x^2) = \text{constant}
\]
\[
260 + 64 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]
\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

Since the constant is the same, we can solve for \( x^2 \):
\[
x^2 = 324 - 324 = 0
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{0} = 0

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since the force applied to both Kamios is the same (the force Jack applies to his Kamio is the same as the force Jen applies to her Kamio), we can set the two force equations equal to each other:

\[ m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} = m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} \]

We know the masses of the Kamios:
- Mass of Jack's Kamio, \( m_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \) g
- Mass of Jen's Kamio, \( m_{\text{Jen}} = 200 \) g

We need to find the ratio of Jen's Kamio's acceleration to Jack's Kamio's acceleration, which is \( \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} \). From the equation above, we can solve for \( a_{\text{Jen}} \) in terms of \( a_{\text{Jack}} \):

\[ a_{\text{Jen}} = \frac{m_{\text{Jack}}}{m_{\text{Jen}}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \]

Substituting the known masses into the equation, we get:

"To determine how many of the same digits are present in the number \(629_{10}\) when it is represented in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder } 6
\]
\[

Now we have the representations in both bases:

- Base 7: \(1556_7\)

Next, we list the digits in each representation:

- Digits in \(1556_7\): \(1, 5, 6\)

The problem states that there are 6 women and 10 men, and each woman shakes hands with each man exactly once. This means that each of the 6 women shakes hands with each of the 10 men, resulting in a total of \(6 \times 10 = 60\) handshakes.

The problem also mentions that no woman shakes hands with another woman and no man shakes hands with another man, which is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, the total number of handshakes is simply the product of the number of women and the number of men.

Thus, the number of handshakes that occurred during the meeting is \(\boxed{60}\).","[60, '60']",60,"[60, '60']",True
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0).
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2.

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[ d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

\[ y - 2x + 2 = 0 \]

Here, \(A = -2\), \(B = 1\), and \(C = 2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[ d = \frac{|-2(6) + 1(0) + 2|}{\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|-12 + 0 + 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|-10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[ d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. That is,

\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

From Vieta's formulas, we know that

\[

\]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can express \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Notice that

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).

Expanding this product, we get

\]

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the roots of the polynomial can be written in a specific form. The roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) are

\[
\alpha_1 = -1 + i, \quad \alpha_2 = -1 - i, \quad \alpha_3 = 1 + i, \quad \alpha_4 = 1 - i.
\]

Now, we can calculate \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\):

\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = (-1 + i)(-1 - i) + (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = (-1 + i)(1 + i) + (-1 - i)(1 - i) = -1 - 1 + i - i - 1 - 1 - i + i = -4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = (-1 + i)(1 - i) + (-1 - i)(1 + i) = -1 + 1 - i + i - 1 + 1 + i - i = -4.
\]

Thus, the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are \(4\), \(-4\), and \(-4\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is

"To determine the cost of one pieštukas, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one pieštukas by \( p \) dollars and the cost of one didelis trintukas by \( t \) dollars.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. Two pieštukai and one didelis trintukas cost \$1.24:
   \[
   2p + t = 1.24
   \]
2. Five pieštukai and one didelis trintukas cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5p + t = 1.82
   \]

To eliminate \( t \) from the equations, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(5p + t) - (2p + t) = 1.82 - 1.24

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
p = \frac{0.58}{3} = \frac{58}{300} = \frac{29}{150} \approx 0.1933

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Let the coordinates of \(A\) be \((-a, b)\), \(B\) be \((a, b)\), \(C\) be \((a, -b)\), and \(D\) be \((-a, -b)\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(2a / 2b = k\), or \(a = kb\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A(-a, b)\), is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). We need to find the region where \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\), and similarly for the other vertices.

Squaring both sides of the inequality \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\), we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:
\[x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2,\]
\[0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2,\]
\[2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0,\]
\[ax - by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} > 0.\]
This is the equation of a line. The region satisfying this inequality is on one side of the line. Repeating this process for the other vertices, we get four lines that divide the rectangle into eight regions, with one of these regions being the region where the point is closer to the center than to any vertex.

The region where the point is closer to the center than to any vertex is a smaller rectangle with center \(O\) and side lengths \(a/2\) and \(b/2\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) for each of the given values of \( n \) and then sum the results.

The function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{array}

Let's evaluate each term step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, calculate \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we get:
     \[ \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472. \]
   - Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function:
     \[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2. \]

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, calculate \( \sqrt{45} \). Using the approximation \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7082 \), we get:
     \[ \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7082. \]
   - Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
     \[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6. \]

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, calculate \( 8^{2/3} \). Using the property of exponents, we get:
     \[ 8^{2/3} = (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4. \]
   - Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
     \[ f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

- Sherry: \( 3523 \div 100 = 35 \) banknotes with a remainder of \( 3523 - 35 \times 100 = 23 \) cents
- June: \( 3737 \div 100 = 37 \) banknotes with a remainder of \( 3737 - 37 \times 100 = 37 \) cents
- Connie: \( 2652 \div 100 = 26 \) banknotes with a remainder of \( 2652 - 26 \times 100 = 52 \) cents

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). The sum of these numbers is:

The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). The sum of these numbers is:

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:

"To determine how many fewer paces Džimas travels compared to Marta, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Džimas travels. Džimas eina įstrižai per lauką, so he travels the diagonal of the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2} \]
Given that the length of the field is 400 paces and the width is 300 paces, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ paces} \]
So, Džimas travels 500 paces.

\[ \text{Distance Marta travels} = \text{length} + \text{width} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ paces} \]
So, Marta travels 700 paces.

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This means that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). The roots of \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\) are given by the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

So, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\omega^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}\). These roots satisfy the property \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
