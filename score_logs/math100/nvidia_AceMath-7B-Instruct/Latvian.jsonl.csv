"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then divide by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate the complex numbers so that \( c \) is at the origin.**
2. **Rotate the translated complex number \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise.**
3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.**

Let's start with the given complex numbers:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

### Step 1: Translate the complex numbers so that \( c \) is at the origin.
First, we find the difference between \( z \) and \( c \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

### Step 2: Rotate the translated complex number \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise.
To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We use the distributive property (FOIL method) to expand this product:
\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} - 3i \frac{2}{2} - 3i^2 \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i - 3(-1) \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

### Step 3: Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.
Now, we add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:
\[ w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:
\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \]","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

3. So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

4. Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization. We know that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table such that Pjērs, Roza, and Tomass always sit together, we can treat Pjērs, Roza, and Tomass as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pjērs, Roza, and Tomass within their block. There are 3 people in the block, and the number of ways to arrange 3 people in a line is \(3! = 6\).

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table such that Pjērs, Roza, and Tomass always sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table and the number of ways to arrange Pjērs, Roza, and Tomass within their block. This gives us:

\[ 120 \times 6 = 720 \]

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table such that Pjērs, Roza, and Tomass always sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of the expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we need to identify the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero. We will use the Binomial Theorem for this purpose.

The Binomial Theorem states that:
\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]
In our case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]
Simplifying the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
Solving for \(k\), we get:
\[
k = 3
\]
Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:
\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

Thus, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is:

"To determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = ((7k + 2) + 2)((7k + 2) + 4)((7k + 2) + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).
\]

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:
\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, calculate \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):
\[

\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the properties of rotational symmetry of a regular pentagon.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and it can be rotated around its center by certain angles to look exactly the same as it did before. The smallest such angle is called the order of rotational symmetry. For a regular pentagon, this angle is given by:

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[

\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the other possible diagonal.

The other diagonal connects the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[

Since the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:

Since the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)

This gives us two separate equations:

\[

Solving the second equation for \(y\):

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)

   So, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   The values of \( a \) and \( b \) are 7 and -2, respectively.

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) without using a calculator, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's start by expressing the expression in a form that might be easier to handle.

First, consider the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\). Notice that this expression is similar to the polynomial \(x^2 + x + 1\) where \(x = 99\).

We know that \(x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)\). If we substitute \(x = 99\) into this equation, we get:
\[99^3 - 1 = (99-1)(99^2 + 99 + 1) = 98(99^2 + 99 + 1).\]

So, we can express \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) as:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{98}.\]

Next, we need to calculate \(99^3\). We can do this by expanding \(99^3\):
\[99^3 = (100-1)^3 = 100^3 - 3 \cdot 100^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 100 \cdot 1^2 - 1^3 = 1000000 - 30000 + 300 - 1 = 970299.\]

Now, substitute \(99^3 = 970299\) back into the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{970299 - 1}{98} = \frac{970298}{98}.\]

To simplify \(\frac{970298}{98}\), we can perform the division:

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

2. Two trees and one guli together weigh the same as one skiv.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:

2. \( 2T + G = S \)

First, let's simplify the first equation by subtracting \( G \) from both sides:
\[ 3S = 2T \]

Next, we solve for \( T \) in terms of \( S \):

\[ 2T = 2\left(\frac{3S}{2}\right) = 3S \]

We need to determine how many skivs have the same weight as two trees. Since one skiv weighs \( S \), the number of skivs that have the same weight as two trees is:
\[ \frac{3S}{S} = 3 \]

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this polynomial is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

   This matches.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), so we have:

Thus, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of the function \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function piecewise.

The function is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the quadratic part \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Domain**: \( x \geq a \)
2. **Behavior**: Since \( a \) is a constant, the quadratic function \( ax^2 \) opens upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).

   - If \( a > 0 \):
     - The minimum value occurs at \( x = a \):
       \[
       f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
       \]
     - As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \).

   - If \( a < 0 \):
     - The maximum value occurs at \( x = a \):
       \[
       f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
       \]
     - As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to -\infty \).

### Step 2: Analyze the linear part \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Domain**: \( x < a \)
2. **Behavior**: The linear function \( ax + 2a \) has a slope of \( a \).

   - If \( a > 0 \):
     - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \to -\infty \).
     - As \( x \to a^- \), \( f(x) \to a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a \).

   - If \( a < 0 \):
     - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \).
     - As \( x \to a^- \), \( f(x) \to a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a \).

### Step 3: Determine the conditions for intersection with every horizontal line

For the function \( f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, it must cover all real values.

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - The quadratic part \( ax^2 \) covers \( [a^3, \infty) \).
   - The linear part \( ax + 2a \) covers \( (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \).
   - To ensure all real values are covered, we need:
     \[
     a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.
     \]
   - Factoring:
     \[
     a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \implies a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.
     \]
   - The roots are \( a = 0, 2, -1 \). Testing intervals:
     - For \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) (true).
     - For \( a \in [-1, 0] \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0 \) (false).
     - For \( a \in [0, 2] \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) (true).
     - For \( a \in [2, \infty) \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0 \) (false).

   Thus, \( a \) must be in \( (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2] \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - The quadratic part \( ax^2 \) covers \( (-\infty, a^3] \).
   - The linear part \( ax + 2a \) covers \( (a^2 + 2a, \infty) \).
   - To ensure all real values are covered, we need:
     \[
     a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a.
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0.
     \]
   - This is the same inequality as before, but we need the opposite sign. Thus, \( a \) must be in \( (-1, 0) \).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius. We know that the radius \(r\) is 1, so we set \(34 - c\) equal to \(1^2\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \(c\), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0, 4]\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0, 1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). We solve the equation:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)). We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0, 1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(x\) is not a fixed point but satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2). \]

We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so we solve:

\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0. \]

This gives us two cases to consider:

1. \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point.
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the second equation has a solution \(x \in [0, 1]\) that is not a fixed point. Let's substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the second equation and see if it simplifies:

\[ \lambda^2 \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2\right) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ \lambda^2 \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - (\lambda - 1) + \lambda \left(\frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2}\right)\right) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ \lambda \left(1 - \lambda + 1 + \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ \lambda \left(2 - \lambda + \frac{\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ \lambda \left(2 - \lambda + \lambda - 2 + \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ \lambda \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ 1 - 1 = 0. \]

This is an identity, so \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution for all \(\lambda \neq 0\). However, we need to ensure that \(x \in [0, 1]\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), so \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must be in \([0, 1]\) and not equal to 0 or 1. This gives us:

\[ 0 < \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} < 1. \]

Solving the inequality \(0 < \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), we get \(\lambda > 1\). Solving the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} < 1\), we get \(\lambda > 0\), which is already satisfied. Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the conditions are:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan(A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to simplify this expression. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we get:
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
The smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is \(\theta = 120^\circ\). Thus, the answer is:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S is 1 each.

The maximum value of the sine function is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only relevant solution is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The vectors are given by:
\[

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This can be derived from the multiple-angle formula for cosine. Since \( \cos(5\theta) = -\cos(2\pi - 5\theta) \), we can see that \( 5\theta \) is an angle that is related to the golden ratio in a periodic manner.

By examining the periodicity and symmetry of the cosine function, we can deduce that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \( G \) of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

Given that the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians, which is \( 2:3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( 2:3 \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:
\[

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \( ENG \). Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides triangle \( AMN \) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is:

"To determine the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of mathematics books in each plaukt.
2. Determine the total number of mathematics books initially.
3. Calculate the number of mathematics books remaining after two books are taken from each plaukt.
4. Calculate the total number of remaining books after two books are taken from each plaukt.
5. Find the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of mathematics books in each plaukt:**
   - The total number of books in the bookcase is 24.
   - The number of books in the top plaukt is 3.
   - The number of books in the top plaukt is 8.
   - The number of books in the top plaukt is 10.
   - The number of books in the top plaukt is 6.
   
   Therefore, the number of books in each plaukt is:
   - Top plaukt: 3 books
   - Middle plaukt: 8 books
   - Bottom plaukt: 10 books
   - Bottom plaukt: 6 books

2. **Determine the total number of mathematics books initially:**
   - The number of mathematics books in the top plaukt is 10.
   - The number of mathematics books in the middle plaukt is 0 (since it is not specified).
   - The number of mathematics books in the bottom plaukt is 0 (since it is not specified).
   - The number of mathematics books in the bottom plaukt is 0 (since it is not specified).

   Therefore, the total number of mathematics books initially is 10.

3. **Calculate the number of mathematics books remaining after two books are taken from each plaukt:**
   - After two books are taken from the top plaukt, the number of mathematics books remaining is \(10 - 2 = 8\).
   - After two books are taken from the middle plaukt, the number of mathematics books remaining is \(0 - 0 = 0\).
   - After two books are taken from the bottom plaukt, the number of mathematics books remaining is \(0 - 0 = 0\).
   - After two books are taken from the bottom plaukt, the number of mathematics books remaining is \(0 - 0 = 0\).

   Therefore, the total number of mathematics books remaining is \(8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8\).

4. **Calculate the total number of remaining books after two books are taken from each plaukt:**
   - After two books are taken from the top plaukt, the number of books remaining is \(3 - 2 = 1\).
   - After two books are taken from the middle plaukt, the number of books remaining is \(8 - 2 = 6\).
   - After two books are taken from the bottom plaukt, the number of books remaining is \(10 - 2 = 8\).
   - After two books are taken from the bottom plaukt, the number of books remaining is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

   Therefore, the total number of remaining books is \(1 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 19\).

5. **Find the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books:**
   - The number of mathematics books remaining is 8.
   - The total number of remaining books is 19.

   Therefore, the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books is \(\frac{8}{19}\).

"To determine how many positive two-digit numbers have both 100 and 150 as divisors, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 150. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[
\text{LCM}(100, 150) = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 3 \times 25 = 300
\]

So, the LCM of 100 and 150 is 300. This means that any number that is a multiple of both 100 and 150 must be a multiple of 300.

Next, we need to find how many positive two-digit multiples of 300 exist. The smallest two-digit number is 10 and the largest two-digit number is 99. We list the multiples of 300 that fall within this range:
\[
300 \times 1 = 300 \quad (\text{which is a three-digit number})

\[

"To determine if \(2^{24}\) is a perfect \(n^{\text{th}}\) power for some positive integer \(n > 1\), we need to check if there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(2^{24} = k^n\).

First, let's express \(2^{24}\) in a form that might help us identify such an \(n\). We know that \(2^{24} = (2^8)^3 = (2^{12})^2 = (2^{24})^1\). This shows that \(2^{24}\) can be written as a perfect square, a perfect cube, and a perfect 24th power.

To generalize, we need to find the prime factorization of \(2^{24}\). The prime factorization of \(2^{24}\) is simply \(2^{24}\), which means that \(2^{24}\) can be written as \(k^n\) where \(k = 2^m\) and \(m = \frac{24}{n}\). For \(k\) to be an integer, \(n\) must be a divisor of 24.

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since we are looking for \(n > 1\), the possible values for \(n\) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \(n > 1\) for which \(2^{24}\) is a perfect \(n^{\text{th}}\) power. These values are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

"To determine how many centi coins Hilarijai has, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of ten-cent coins by \( x \) and the number of one-cent coins by \( y \). According to the problem, Hilarijai has a total of 18 coins, and the total value of these coins is 75 cents. We can express these conditions with the following system of equations:

1. \( x + y = 18 \)
2. \( 10x + y = 75 \) (since each ten-cent coin is worth 10 cents and each one-cent coin is worth 1 cent)

Next, we solve this system of equations step by step. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( y \):

\[ (10x + y) - (x + y) = 75 - 18 \]
\[ 9x = 57 \]
\[ x = \frac{57}{9} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Hilarijai has 6 ten-cent coins. Now, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the first equation to find \( y \):

\[ 6 + y = 18 \]
\[ y = 18 - 6 \]
\[ y = 12 \]

Therefore, Hilarijai has 12 one-cent coins. The number of one-cent coins Hilarijai has is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Pāvils and Džesijs is even, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Let's break down the problem step by step.

4. Calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the chosen numbers is even. This can happen in two scenarios:

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - There is only one specific square on the grid where the riddle can be placed, which is the square at the intersection of a specific row and a specific column.
   - For each specific row, there is exactly one number that satisfies the condition of the second number (since there are 4 possible remainders and 5 possible rows, each row will have exactly one number that satisfies the condition).

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). We can apply this identity to the terms \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\):

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Now, substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[

"To determine the form of the surface described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates. The coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) represent the following:

- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This describes a surface that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and extends infinitely in the \(r\) and \(\theta\) directions.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the properties of the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying, we get:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

Let the measure of the one interior angle that is not included in the sum be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
180(n-2) - x = 1070
\]

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of the polygon, it must satisfy the inequality \(0 < x < 180\). First, we need to find the value of \(180(n-2)\) by isolating it in the equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

Because \(0 < x < 180\), it follows that:

\[
1070 < 180(n-2) < 1250
\]

Next, we divide the entire inequality by 180 to solve for \(n\):

\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplifying the fractions, we get:

\[
5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
\]

Since \(n-2\) must be an integer, the only possible value is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6 \implies n = 8
\]

To verify, we calculate the sum of the interior angles of an octagon:

\[
180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080
\]

If one interior angle is \(x\), then the sum of the remaining seven interior angles is:

\[
1080 - x

Given that this sum is \(1070^\circ\), we have:

\[
1080 - x = 1070 \implies x = 10

"To solve the problem, we need to find a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

Let's start by expressing this congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = 17 \).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
   The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

2. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   The area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
   \[
   \text{Area} = 10 \times 8 = 80
   \]
   This area includes the points on the boundary of the rectangle.

3. **Determine the number of points on the boundary:**
   - The top side of the rectangle has endpoints \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\). The number of integer points on this side is \(5 - (-5) + 1 = 11\).
   - The bottom side of the rectangle has endpoints \((5,-4)\) and \((-5,-4)\). The number of integer points on this side is also \(5 - (-5) + 1 = 11\).
   - The right side of the rectangle has endpoints \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\). The number of integer points on this side is \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\).
   - The left side of the rectangle has endpoints \((-5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\). The number of integer points on this side is also \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) given that \( ABCD \) is a trapezoid with \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \), \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), and the area of trapezoid \( ABCD \) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \( AD = a \)
- \( BC = b \)
- \( CD = c \)
- \( AC = h \)

Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( h \) is the height of the trapezoid from vertex \( A \) to base \( BC \).

Given that \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), we can use the angle bisector theorem in \( \triangle ABD \). The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{AD}{CD} = \frac{a}{c} \]

The area of trapezoid \( ABCD \) is given by:
\[ [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \]
\[ (a + b) \times h = 84 \]

Now, let's consider \( \triangle ACD \). The area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:
\[ [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c \]

To find \( c \), we use the fact that \( \overline{AC} \) is the height of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \overline{AC} \) is also the height of \( \triangle ABC \). Since \( \overline{AC} \) is the height of both triangles, we can use the relationship between the areas of the triangles and the bases:
\[ \frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b} \]

The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \]

Using the relationship between the areas of the triangles:
\[ \frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{a}{b} \]
\[ \frac{\frac{1}{2} \times a \times c}{\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h} = \frac{a}{b} \]
\[ \frac{a \times c}{b \times h} = \frac{a}{b} \]
\[ c = h \]

Now, we substitute \( c = h \) into the area formula for \( \triangle ACD \):
\[ [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h \]

We know from the area of the trapezoid that:
\[ (a + b) \times h = 84 \]

Since \( c = h \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( h \):
\[ b = \frac{84}{h} - a \]

Substituting \( b \) into the area formula for \( \triangle ACD \):
\[ [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h \]

We need to find the value of \( a \) and \( h \) such that the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is a part of the total area of the trapezoid. Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are in the ratio of their bases \( AD \) and \( BC \). Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half of the area of the trapezoid:
\[ [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21 \]

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are no restrictions on the order in which they are chosen. However, the order in which the points are chosen does not affect the probability of the chords intersecting, so we can consider the points as fixed once chosen.

2. **Determine the condition for the chords to intersect:**
   The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

3. **Calculate the number of favorable arrangements:**
   There are \(4!\) (24) possible ways to arrange the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a sequence.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi

The area of the overlapping region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[

The overlapping region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. The area of a segment of a circle is given by the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord of the segment.

Let's denote the central angle of the sector in the larger circle by \(\theta\) (in radians). The area of the sector in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector in the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta

\text{Area of the sector in the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \phi = \frac{\phi}{2}
\]

The area of the triangle in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle in the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \phi = \frac{1}{2} \sin \phi
\]

Thus, the area of the segment in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment in the smaller circle} = \frac{\phi}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \phi = \frac{1}{2}(\phi - \sin \phi)
\]

The total area of the overlapping region is the sum of the areas of the segments from both circles:
\[
\text{Area of the overlapping region} = 2(\theta - \sin \theta) + \frac{1}{2}(\phi - \sin \phi)
\]

We know that this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
2(\theta - \sin \theta) + \frac{1}{2}(\phi - \sin \phi) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Since the circles are tangent at the point of intersection, the sum of the central angles \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) is \(2\pi\):
\[
\theta + \phi = 2\pi
\]

We can express \(\phi\) in terms of \(\theta\):
\[
\phi = 2\pi - \theta
\]

Substituting \(\phi = 2\pi - \theta\) into the area equation, we get:
\[
2(\theta - \sin \theta) + \frac{1}{2}((2\pi - \theta) - \sin(2\pi - \theta)) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Since \(\sin(2\pi - \theta) = -\sin \theta\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
2(\theta - \sin \theta) + \frac{1}{2}(2\pi - \theta + \sin \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
\[
2\theta - 2\sin \theta + \pi - \frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{\sin \theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\frac{3\theta}{2} - \frac{3\sin \theta}{2} + \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{2}(\theta - \sin \theta) + \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{2}(\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3} - \pi
\]
\[
\frac{3}{2}(\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{4\pi}{9}
\]

We need to find \(\theta\) such that \(\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{4\pi}{9}\). By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution:
\[
\frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin \frac{2\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \frac{2\pi}{3} - 0.866 \approx 2.094 - 0.866 = 1.228 \approx \frac{4\pi}{9} \approx 1.396

Thus, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical containers are needed to fill a spherical container, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical and spherical containers and then find the ratio of the spherical volume to the cylindrical volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical container, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical container, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical containers are required to fill the spherical container. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical container by the volume of one cylindrical container:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical containers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical containers needed to fill the spherical container is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from feet per minute to centimeters per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert feet per minute to feet per second.
2. Convert feet per second to centimeters per second.

**Step 1: Convert feet per minute to feet per second.**

The bicycle travels at a speed of 20 feet per minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the speed to feet per second by dividing by 60:

\[ \text{Speed in feet per second} = \frac{20 \text{ feet per minute}}{60 \text{ seconds per minute}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet per second} \]

**Step 2: Convert feet per second to centimeters per second.**

There are 30.48 centimeters in a foot. Therefore, we can convert the speed from feet per second to centimeters per second by multiplying by 30.48:

\[ \text{Speed in centimeters per second} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet per second} \times 30.48 \text{ centimeters per foot} = \frac{30.48}{3} \text{ centimeters per second} = 10.16 \text{ centimeters per second} \]

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from a committee of 8 republicans and 6 democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee without any restrictions.**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 + 6) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that includes only republicans.**
   The number of ways to choose 5 republicans from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that includes only democrats.**
   The number of ways to choose 5 democrats from 6 is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x-2 = 64\)
2. \(x-2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

"To find the perimeter of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we start by letting \(BC = a\) and \(AB = AC = b\). The point \(D\) on \(AM\) is such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, we note that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), so \(BM = MC = \frac{a}{2}\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle AMB\), we have:
\[
b^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]
Thus,
\[
b^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle BDC\). Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 = \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 = \frac{a^2}{4} + 1.
\]
Similarly, in \(\triangle CDM\), we have:
\[
CD^2 = CM^2 + DM^2 = \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 = \frac{a^2}{4} + 1.
\]
Thus, \(BD = CD = \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4} + 1}\).

Now, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). In \(\triangle BDC\), we can use the Law of Sines:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]
Since \(BD = CD\), we have:
\[
\frac{a}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4} + 1}}{\sin \left(90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4} + 1}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}.
\]
Using the triple angle identity \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\) and the fact that \(\sin \theta = \frac{a}{2b}\), we get:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \cdot \frac{a}{2b} - 4 \left(\frac{a}{2b}\right)^3 = \frac{3a}{2b} - \frac{a^3}{2b^3}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{a}{\frac{3a}{2b} - \frac{a^3}{2b^3}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4} + 1}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
\frac{a \cdot 2b^3}{3ab^2 - a^3} = \frac{2b^3}{3b^2 - a^2}.
\]
We also know that \(\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{121}{b^2}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{b^2 + 121}{2b^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{b^2 + 121}}{\sqrt{2}b}\).
Thus,
\[
\frac{2b^3}{3b^2 - a^2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{a^2}{4} + 1} \cdot \sqrt{2}b}{\sqrt{b^2 + 121}}.
\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[
\frac{2b^2}{3b^2 - a^2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + 4}{4}} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{b^2 + 121}} = \frac{\sqrt{2(a^2 + 4)}}{2\sqrt{b^2 + 121}} = \frac{\sqrt{2(a^2 + 4)}}{2\sqrt{121 + \frac{a^2}{4} + 121}} = \frac{\sqrt{2(a^2 + 4)}}{2\sqrt{242 + \frac{a^2}{4}}}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{4b^4}{(3b^2 - a^2)^2} = \frac{2(a^2 + 4)}{4(242 + \frac{a^2}{4})} = \frac{a^2 + 4}{242 + \frac{a^2}{4}} = \frac{4(a^2 + 4)}{968 + a^2}.
\]
Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
4b^4(968 + a^2) = (3b^2 - a^2)^2(a^2 + 4).
\]
Substituting \(b^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}\), we get:
\[
4\left(121 + \frac{a^2}{4}\right)^2(968 + a^2) = (3\left(121 + \frac{a^2}{4}\right) - a^2)^2(a^2 + 4).
\]
Simplifying, we find that \(a = 22\). Thus, \(b^2 = 121 + \frac{22^2}{4} = 121 + 121 = 242\), so \(b = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}\).

The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

The sum of 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as the product of the number of integers and the average of these integers. Let the first integer be \(a\). The 27 consecutive integers are \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\). The sum of these integers is:

\[
a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)
\]

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\), the last term \(a+26\), and the number of terms 27. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]

We know that the sum is 2187, so we set up the equation:

\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]

Solving for \(a\), we divide both sides by 27:

\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:

\[
a = 68

The 27 consecutive integers are therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. Counting to the 14th term, we have:

"To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) holds, we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), we can simplify this to:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:
\[ -2 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies further to:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this expression in terms of symmetric sums:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the equation, we get
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
\[24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p) = s(s^2 - 4p),\]
\[24 = sp.\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left( \left( \frac{24}{p} \right)^2 - 4p \right) = \frac{24}{p} \left( \frac{576}{p^2} - 4p \right) = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 4p^3}{p^2} = \frac{24(576 - 4p^3)}{p^3}.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[-8 = \frac{13824 - 96p^3}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[-8p^3 = 13824 - 96p^3,\]

1. Calculate the number of male and female bus passengers in each class.
2. Check which class satisfies the condition that the number of male bus passengers is 135% of the number of female bus passengers.

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus passengers in each class:

**9th Class:**
- Number of male bus passengers: \(41.1\% \times 600 = 246.6 \approx 247\)
- Number of female bus passengers: \(39.4\% \times 600 = 236.4 \approx 236\)

- Number of male bus passengers: \(11.6\% \times 600 = 69.6 \approx 70\)
- Number of female bus passengers: \(8.6\% \times 600 = 51.6 \approx 52\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero.

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the denominator in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular field, we need to analyze the given track and its components. The track consists of two straight segments and two semicircular segments. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangular field by \( L \) meters and the width by \( W \) meters. The two straight segments of the track are equal to the length of the field, so each straight segment is \( L \) meters. The two semicircular segments form a full circle with a diameter equal to the width of the field, so the radius of the circle is \( \frac{W}{2} \) meters.

The circumference of the full circle is given by:
\[ 2\pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right) = \pi W \]

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight segments and the circumference of the circle:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ 2L = 400 - \pi W \]
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) W \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
\[ \pi W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right) \]
\[ L = 200 - 100 \]
\[ L = 100 \]

The maximum area \( A \) is:
\[ A = L \times W \]
\[ A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} \]
\[ A = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Therefore, the maximum possible area of the rectangular field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is:
   \[
   \text{opposite} = \sin{R} \times \text{hypotenuse} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
   \]

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the adjacent side \(ST\) is:
   \[
   ST = \sqrt{RT^2 - \text{opposite}^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}
   \]

3. **Determine \(\sin{T}\):**
   In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side to that angle divided by the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Next, we expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[ (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \]

So the distance formula becomes:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the expression inside the square root. Let \(u = x^2\). Then the expression becomes a function of \(u\):

\[ f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(u)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(u) = u - 2 \]
\[ u - 2 = 0 \]
\[ u = 2 \]

To confirm that this critical point is a minimum, we check the second derivative:

\[ f''(u) = 1 \]

Since \(f''(u) > 0\), the function \(f(u)\) has a minimum at \(u = 2\). Substituting \(u = 2\) back into the function \(f(u)\):

\[ f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

Therefore, the minimum value of the distance \(d\) is:

\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

The minimum distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron. Let's denote the vertices of the regular octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are the vertices of one face and \( E, F \) are the vertices of the opposite face. The point \( P \) is such that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, respectively. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the vertex \( F \).

First, recall that in a regular octahedron, the distance between any two opposite vertices (the length of the space diagonal) is the same. Let this distance be \( s \sqrt{2} \), where \( s \) is the edge length of the octahedron. The distance between any two adjacent vertices is \( s \).

The key property we will use is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to the vertices is constant and equal to \( 4s^2 + 4d^2 \), where \( d \) is the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron. However, for simplicity, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) and \( F \) is constant.

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) as \( x \). Then, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the known distances:
\[
3^2 = 9, \quad 7^2 = 49, \quad 8^2 = 64, \quad 9^2 = 81, \quad 11^2 = 121
\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

So, we have:
\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to \( 4s^2 + 4d^2 \). However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) and \( F \) is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron with side length \( s \sqrt{2} \) and the distance from \( P \) to the center of the tetrahedron.

Given that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) is 324, the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) must be such that the sum of the squares of the distances is constant. Therefore, we have:
\[
x^2 = 324 - 324 = 0
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{0} = 0
\]

However, this is not possible since \( P \) is not at the center of the octahedron. Therefore, we need to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to \( 4s^2 + 4d^2 \).

Given that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) is 324, the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) must be such that the sum of the squares of the distances is constant. Therefore, we have:
\[
x^2 = 324 - 324 = 0

\[
x = \sqrt{0} = 0

"To determine how many digits are the same in the representation of the number \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[

\[

- Base 7: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The digits that are the same in both representations are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\). There are 3 such digits.

Since the rooks do not age while they are in the dream, the total number of years of the rook's life that were spent in the dream is simply the number of years the dream lasts. However, the problem does not specify the duration of the dream, so we cannot determine the exact number of years the rooks spent in the dream.

The constant term of this polynomial is \(-S_1 S_2 S_3\), which is the product of the roots taken one at a time with a sign change. This product can be found by considering the polynomial whose roots are the products of the roots of the original polynomial taken two at a time.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the rectangle as \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is the intersection of the diagonals, and it divides each diagonal into two equal parts. The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is half the length of the diagonal. The length of the diagonal \(AC\) (or \(BD\)) is given by:

However, a simpler approach is to consider the symmetry and the fact that the region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is a smaller rectangle with the same center \(O\) and sides parallel to \(AB\) and \(AD\).

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much Linda, Šerija, Jūna, and Konija have in total after their purchases, we first need to add up the amounts each person spent. The amounts are as follows:

- Linda: \$27.47
- Šerija: \$35.23
- Jūna: \$37.37
- Konija: \$26.52

We start by adding these amounts step by step.

First, add Linda's and Šerija's amounts:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70 \]

Next, add Jūna's amount to the result:
\[ 62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07 \]

Finally, add Konija's amount to the result:
\[ 100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59 \]

So, the total amount of money they have after their purchases is \$126.59. Since they are going to bank the money and convert it to dollars, and assuming they can only convert whole dollars, they will have \$126 in dollars and 59 cents left over.

Therefore, the amount of money they have in cents after converting the remaining money to dollars is:
\[ 59 \]

"To find the average (arithmetic mean) score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score of the students:
- 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these scores to get the total score for the entire class:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students in the class to find the average score:
\[\text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):
- The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]
- The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum is:
  \[
  3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]
- The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top right to the bottom left contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 5 + 2 = 15
  \]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many fewer paces Džims walks compared to Marta, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Džims travels. Džims walks diagonally across the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the field is 400 paces and the width is 300 paces. Therefore, the distance Džims travels is:
\[
\sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ paces}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Marta travels. Marta walks along the perimeter of the field, specifically along the length and the width. Therefore, the distance Marta travels is:
\[
400 + 300 = 700 \text{ paces}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Marta travels and the distance Džims travels:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ paces}
\]

Thus, Džims walks \(\boxed{200}\) paces fewer than Marta.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This means that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). The roots of \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\) are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), we get:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest total distance that can be achieved by starting at any of the points \( A, B, C, \) or \( D \) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we can use the concept of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP aims to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of points and returns to the starting point.

Let's denote the distances between the points as follows:
- \( d(A, B) \) is the distance between points \( A \) and \( B \)
- \( d(A, C) \) is the distance between points \( A \) and \( C \)
- \( d(A, D) \) is the distance between points \( A \) and \( D \)
- \( d(B, C) \) is the distance between points \( B \) and \( C \)
- \( d(B, D) \) is the distance between points \( B \) and \( D \)
- \( d(C, D) \) is the distance between points \( C \) and \( D \)

To find the shortest total distance, we can calculate the total distance for each possible starting point and the different orders in which we can visit the other points. 

1. **Starting at point \( A \)**:
   - Possible routes: \( A \to B \to C \to D \), \( A \to B \to D \to C \), \( A \to C \to B \to D \), \( A \to C \to D \to B \), \( A \to D \to B \to C \), \( A \to D \to C \to B \)
   - Calculate the total distance for each route.

2. **Starting at point \( B \)**:
   - Possible routes: \( B \to A \to C \to D \), \( B \to A \to D \to C \), \( B \to C \to A \to D \), \( B \to C \to D \to A \), \( B \to D \to A \to C \), \( B \to D \to C \to A \)
   - Calculate the total distance for each route.

3. **Starting at point \( C \)**:
   - Possible routes: \( C \to A \to B \to D \), \( C \to A \to D \to B \), \( C \to B \to A \to D \), \( C \to B \to D \to A \), \( C \to D \to A \to B \), \( C \to D \to B \to A \)
   - Calculate the total distance for each route.

4. **Starting at point \( D \)**:
   - Possible routes: \( D \to A \to B \to C \), \( D \to A \to C \to B \), \( D \to B \to A \to C \), \( D \to B \to C \to A \), \( D \to C \to A \to B \), \( D \to C \to B \to A \)
   - Calculate the total distance for each route.

After calculating the total distances for all possible routes from each starting point, we can find the minimum distance among all these calculations.

Finally, we can denote the shortest total distance as:
