"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then divide by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\) into the equation, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}i}{2} + \frac{6\sqrt{2}i^2}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Now, we use the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units to arrange in a circle, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block, which is \(3! = 6\).

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720
\]

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Next, we calculate \((10x^3)^2\):

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]

Then, we calculate \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each factor modulo 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder of 4 when divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder of 6 when divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder of 8 when divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.

Finally, find the remainder of 24 when divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,

so
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to return to its original position, we need to understand the concept of rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, which means it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

Here are the steps to find the minimum number of degrees:

1. Identify the number of sides of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has 5 sides.
2. Calculate the angle of rotation by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides. This is because a full rotation is 360 degrees and the pentagon will look the same after each rotation that is a fraction of this full rotation corresponding to the number of sides.

The calculation is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), let the fourth vertex be \((x, y)\).

First, we find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid. Let's consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices.

If we take the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\), the midpoint is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid either.

Finally, if we take the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\), the midpoint is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this solution is valid.

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(2\cos A\) for \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can simplify the expression by canceling \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we factor it first:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

Thus, we have:

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36.\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

We use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of a squig. Let's define the weights of the objects as follows:
- Let the weight of one treek be \( T \).
- Let the weight of one squig be \( S \).
- Let the weight of one goolee be \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. The weight of one treek is equal to the weight of three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   T = 3S + G
   \]
2. The weight of two treeks and one goolee is equal to the weight of one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to eliminate \( G \) from these equations to express \( T \) in terms of \( S \). First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

Combine like terms on the right side of the equation:
\[
T = 4S - 2T
\]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to isolate \( T \):
\[
3T = 4S

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( T \):
\[

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\):
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\):
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\):
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

5. The constant term is \(-2a\), which must equal \(6\):

Since all the coefficients match, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the height \( h \) of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour, or \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour.

The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is the derivative of the volume with respect to time, \( \frac{dV}{dt} \). According to the problem, this rate is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

We can use the chain rule to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height. The volume of the water in the tank is a function of the height of the water, so we can write:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

The derivative of the volume with respect to the height is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, which is \( \pi r^2 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two parts: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the part of the function where \(x \geq a\):
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) on this interval is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

Next, consider the part of the function where \(x < a\):
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). The value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left is \(f(a^-) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on the interval \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left. This ensures that there are no gaps in the range of \(f(x)\).

Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
  \[ (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0. \]
  So, the inequality holds in \((- \infty, -1)\).

- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
  \[ (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \geq 0. \]
  So, the inequality does not hold in \((-1, 0)\).

- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
  \[ (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0. \]
  So, the inequality holds in \((0, 2)\).

- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
  \[ (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \geq 0. \]
  So, the inequality does not hold in \((2, \infty)\).

Additionally, the inequality holds at the roots \(a = -1\), \(a = 0\), and \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) is:
\[ a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]. \]
The largest value of \(a\) in this set is \(2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

The fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)). We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(x\) is not a fixed point but satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]

Since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(x = \frac{y}{\lambda(1 - y)}\) into \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\):

\[ y = \lambda \left( \frac{y}{\lambda(1 - y)} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{y}{\lambda(1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y}{1 - y} \left( \frac{\lambda(1 - y) - y}{\lambda(1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y(\lambda - \lambda y - y)}{\lambda(1 - y)^2} = \frac{y(\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y)}{\lambda(1 - y)^2}. \]

Multiplying both sides by \(\lambda(1 - y)^2\), we get:

\[ \lambda y(1 - y)^2 = y(\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y). \]

Assuming \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[ \lambda (1 - y)^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y. \]

Expanding and simplifying, we have:

\[ \lambda (1 - 2y + y^2) = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda - 2\lambda y + \lambda y^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda y^2 - 2\lambda y + (\lambda + 1)y = 0, \]
\[ y(\lambda y - 2\lambda + \lambda + 1) = 0, \]
\[ y(\lambda y - \lambda + 1) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ y = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

If \(y = 0\), then \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point. If \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(x = \frac{\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}}{\lambda \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}}{\lambda \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda}} = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), which is also a fixed point. Therefore, \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is not a valid solution for a periodic point of period 2.

However, we need to check the condition \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) and ensure that \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in the interval \([0,1]\). This gives us:

\[ 0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1. \]

The inequality \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is true for \(\lambda \ge 1\), and the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is true for all \(\lambda > 0\). Therefore, the valid range for \(\lambda\) is:

\[ 1 \le \lambda \le 4. \]

Thus, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator is \(\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ\).

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator is \(\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ\).

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan (A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to simplify this expression. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 50^\circ\):
\[
\tan 50^\circ = \frac{\sin 50^\circ}{\cos 50^\circ} = \frac{\sin (65^\circ - 15^\circ)}{\cos (65^\circ - 15^\circ)} = \frac{\sin 65^\circ \cos 15^\circ - \cos 65^\circ \sin 15^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ \cos 15^\circ + \sin 65^\circ \sin 15^\circ}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to recognize that:
\[
\frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \tan 50^\circ.

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and thus the given equation becomes:

\[
e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta).
\]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, we can deduce that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

"To determine the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books remaining after two books are taken from each rack.
2. Determine the number of mathematics books remaining.
3. Calculate the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of books remaining after two books are taken from each rack.**

The original number of books on each rack is:
- Top rack: 8 mystery books
- Middle rack: 10 mathematics books
- Bottom rack: 6 science books

The total number of books originally is:
\[ 8 + 10 + 6 = 24 \]

After two books are taken from each rack, the number of books remaining on each rack is:
- Top rack: \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) mystery books
- Middle rack: \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) mathematics books
- Bottom rack: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) science books

The total number of books remaining is:
\[ 6 + 8 + 4 = 18 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of mathematics books remaining.**

The number of mathematics books remaining is 8.

**Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books.**

The fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books is:
\[ \frac{8}{18} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ \frac{8 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = \frac{4}{9} \]

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence where the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula again:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]

"To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as a perfect \( n \)-th power. This means there exists an integer \( k \) such that

\[ 2^{24} = k^n. \]

Taking the \( n \)-th root of both sides, we get

\[ k = 2^{24/n}. \]

For \( k \) to be an integer, \( 24/n \) must be an integer. Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are

"To determine how many nickels Hillary has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. We know that Hillary has 11 coins in total, consisting of dimes and nickels, and the total value of these coins is 75 cents.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We can write two equations based on the information provided:
1. The total number of coins is 11:
   \[
   d + n = 11
   \]
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since each dime is worth 10 cents and each nickel is worth 5 cents, we can write:
   \[
   10d + 5n = 75
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[
2d + n = 15
\]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

To eliminate \( n \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11
\]
\[
2d + n - d - n = 4
\]
\[
d = 4
\]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( n \):
\[
4 + n = 11
\]
\[
n = 11 - 4
\]
\[
n = 7

Therefore, the number of nickels Hillary has is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"To determine the probability that the damsteen is placed on a shaded square of the chessboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of squares on the chessboard:**
   A standard chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, so the total number of squares is:
   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64

"To find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal. To do this, we divide 4321 by 20000000:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation 0.00021605. The digits are 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5. Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We can use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms of the expression:
\[

\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these identities back into the original expression:

\]

Combine the constant terms:
\[

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Determine the measure of the missing interior angle:**
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Find the range for \(x\):**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < x < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the possible values of \(n\) by considering the range of \(x\). We start by isolating \(x\) in the equation:
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Since \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\), we have:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   This inequality can be split into two parts:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

   Solving the first part:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Solving the second part:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 180^\circ + 1070^\circ
   \]
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ

"To find the unique positive integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the congruence:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. To determine which of these is the correct solution, we check which one satisfies the original condition that \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.

For \( t = 4 \):
\[ t + 2 = 6 \]
We need to check if \( 4 \cdot 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \):
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 4 \) is a solution.

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19 \]
We need to check if \( 17 \cdot 19 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \):
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \]
\[ 323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 17 \) is also a solution.

Next, we need to find the side length of the cube. Let \(s\) be the side length of the cube. The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by:

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},

   - The bottom side of the rectangle is from \((-5,-4)\) to \((5,-4)\). The integer points on this side are \((-5,-4), (-4,-4), (-3,-4), (-2,-4), (-1,-4), (0,-4), (1,-4), (2,-4), (3,-4), (4,-4), (5,-4)\). There are 11 points.
   - The left side of the rectangle is from \((-5,4)\) to \((-5,-4)\). The integer points on this side are \((-5,4), (-5,3), (-5,2), (-5,1), (-5,0), (-5,-1), (-5,-2), (-5,-3), (-5,-4)\). There are 9 points.
   - The right side of the rectangle is from \((5,4)\) to \((5,-4)\). The integer points on this side are \((5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (5,-1), (5,-2), (5,-3), (5,-4)\). There are 9 points.
   - However, the four corners of the rectangle are counted twice, so we need to subtract 4 points. The total number of boundary points is \(11 + 11 + 9 + 9 - 4 = 36\).

3. **Calculate the number of integer points inside the rectangle:**
   The number of integer points inside the rectangle is the total number of integer points in the grid from \((-5, -4)\) to \((5, 4)\) minus the number of boundary points. The total number of integer points in the grid is \((10+1) \times (8+1) = 11 \times 9 = 99\). Therefore, the number of integer points inside the rectangle is \(99 - 36 = 63\).

Thus, the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangle is \(\boxed{63}\).","[63, '63']",63,"[63, '63']",True
"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{z}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times (\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{z} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{z}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression reduces to

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}\). Applying this property, we get

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Substituting this into the expression, we have

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Now, we substitute the given values for \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

Thus, the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\) is

"To find the average price of Juan's seëls in the 1970s, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of seëls from each country in the 1970s.
2. Determine the total cost of the seëls from each country.
3. Calculate the total cost of all the seëls.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of seëls to get the average price.

Let's start with the data from the table:

- Number of seëls from Brazil in the 1970s: 12
- Number of seëls from France in the 1970s: 12
- Number of seëls from Peru in the 1970s: 6
- Number of seëls from Spain in the 1970s: 13

Next, we calculate the total cost of the seëls from each country:

- Total cost of seëls from Brazil: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) sent
- Total cost of seëls from France: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) sent
- Total cost of seëls from Peru: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) sent
- Total cost of seëls from Spain: \(13 \times 5 = 65\) sent

Now, we sum these costs to get the total cost of all the seëls:

\[72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233\] sent

Next, we find the total number of seëls:

\[12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43\] seëls

Finally, we calculate the average price of the seëls by dividing the total cost by the total number of seëls:

\[\text{Average price} = \frac{233}{43} \approx 5.4186\]

Rounding this to the nearest tenth of a sent, we get:

\[\text{Average price} \approx 5.4\]

Therefore, the average price of Juan's 1970s seëls is \(\boxed{5.4}\) sent.","[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",True
"To solve for the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezium \(ABCD\):

1. \(ABCD\) is a trapezium with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\).
2. \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), so \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).
3. \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), so \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\).
4. The area of trapezium \(ABCD\) is 42.

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD
\]

The area of trapezium \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h
\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezium. Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(h = CD\). Therefore, the area of the trapezium can be rewritten as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times CD
\]
We know that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times CD
\]
\[
84 = (AD + BC) \times CD
\]

Next, we need to find the relationship between \(AD\), \(BC\), and \(CD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion (both have a right angle and share \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\)). Therefore, the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{BC}{CD} = \frac{AB}{AD}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezium if we consider the height and the base. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the height from \(B\) to \(\overline{AD}\) is the same as the height from \(C\) to \(\overline{AD}\), which is \(CD\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezium:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are no restrictions on the order in which they are chosen. However, the order in which we label the points does not affect the intersection of the segments, so we only need to consider the relative positions of the points on the circle.

2. **Determine the condition for intersection:**
   Segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

3. **Calculate the number of favorable arrangements:**
   There are \(4!\) (24) possible ways to arrange the four points in a specific order. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points relative to \(A\). This gives us \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) relative to \(A\).

   Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments intersecting (the alternating patterns mentioned above). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Since there are 6 total arrangements and 2 favorable arrangements, the probability is:

   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

3. **Determine the total area of the shaded regions:**
   The total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded regions is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Identify the shaded regions:**
   The shaded regions consist of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
   \]
   Therefore, the area of the sector of the larger circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector, large}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
   \]
   And the area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector, small}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
   \]
   The total area of the shaded regions is the sum of these two areas:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = 2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
   \]

5. **Set up the equation and solve for \(\theta\):**
   We know that the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   To solve for \(\theta\), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{2}{5}\):
   \[
   \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]

6. **Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:**
   Since \(\pi\) radians is equal to 180 degrees, we convert \(\theta\) as follows:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180}{3} = 120

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, the expression becomes \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A)
\]

This is a product of two binomials, which can be expanded as:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A = 2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B

Notice that the terms \(2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A\) and \(-2 \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A\) cancel each other out, leaving:
\[
-\sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]

We can factor out \(-\sin^2 A \sin^2 B\) from the expression:
\[
-\sin^2 A \sin^2 B (\cos^2 B + \cos^2 A)
\]

Since \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\), we have:
\[
\sin^2 A = 0.16 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin^2 B = 0.25
\]

To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\cos^2 A = 1 - \sin^2 A = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84
\]
\[
\cos^2 B = 1 - \sin^2 B = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x-2 = 64\)
2. \(x-2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties. We know that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\). Point \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta\).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Place \(M\) at the origin \((0,0)\), so \(A\) is at \((0,11)\). Let \(B\) be at \((-x,0)\) and \(C\) be at \((x,0)\). Since \(AB = AC\), we have:
\[
AB = \sqrt{x^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}
\]
\[
AC = \sqrt{x^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}
\]
Thus, \(AB = AC = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}\).

Now, point \(D\) is at \((0,1)\). We need to use the given condition \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). The tangent of \(\angle BAC\) is:
\[
\tan \angle BAC = \tan 2\theta = \frac{2\tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}
\]
The tangent of \(\angle BDC\) can be found using the coordinates of \(B\), \(D\), and \(C\):
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \left| \frac{\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x}}{1 + \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{x}} \right| = \left| \frac{0}{1 + \frac{1}{x^2}} \right| = 0
\]
However, this is incorrect because \(\angle BDC\) is not a straight line. Instead, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Using the tangent triple angle formula:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}
\]
We know that \(\tan \angle BDC = \frac{2x}{11}\) and \(\tan \angle BAC = \frac{2x}{11}\). Therefore:
\[
\frac{2x}{11} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{2x}{11} - \left(\frac{2x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{2x}{11}\right)^2}
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{11} = \frac{\frac{6x}{11} - \frac{8x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{12x^2}{121}}
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{11} = \frac{\frac{6x}{11} - \frac{8x^3}{1331}}{\frac{121 - 12x^2}{121}}
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{11} = \frac{6x \cdot 121 - 8x^3}{11 \cdot (121 - 12x^2)}

\[
\frac{2x}{11} = \frac{726x - 8x^3}{1331 - 132x^2}

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. Given that the sum is \(3^7\), we first calculate \(3^7\):

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

The sum of 27 consecutive positive integers can be expressed as the product of the number of integers and their average. Let the first integer be \(a\). The 27 consecutive integers are \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\). The sum of these integers is:

\[
a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)
\]

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\), the last term \(a+26\), and the number of terms 27. The sum \(S\) of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
2187 = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)

Solving for \(a\):

\[
2187 = 27 \times (a + 13) \implies a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81 \implies a = 81 - 13 = 68

The first integer is 68. The 27 consecutive integers are \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. Counting to the 14th term, we get:

"To determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \).

Define a new variable \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21. \]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0. \]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) < 0. \]
The roots of the equation \( (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \) are \( y = -7 \) and \( y = 3 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -7) \), \( (-7, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \( y \in (-\infty, -7) \), choose \( y = -8 \):
  \[ (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0. \]
  So, the inequality does not hold in this interval.

- For \( y \in (-7, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0. \]
  So, the inequality holds in this interval.

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0. \]
  So, the inequality does not hold in this interval.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is \( -7 < y < 3 \). Since \( y = x^2 \), we have:
\[ -7 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies to:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

Next, let's solve the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \).

Again, define \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < y^2 + 4y. \]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0. \]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0. \]
The root of the equation \( (y + 2)^2 = 0 \) is \( y = -2 \). This root divides the real number line into two intervals: \( (-\infty, -2) \) and \( (-2, \infty) \). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \( y \in (-\infty, -2) \), choose \( y = -3 \):
  \[ (-3 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 > 0. \]
  So, the inequality holds in this interval.

- For \( y \in (-2, \infty) \), choose \( y = -1 \):
  \[ (-1 + 2)^2 = (1)^2 = 1 > 0. \]
  So, the inequality holds in this interval.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( (y + 2)^2 > 0 \) is \( y \in (-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, \infty) \). Since \( y = x^2 \), we have:
\[ x^2 \in (-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, \infty). \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies to:
\[ x^2 > 0. \]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ x \in (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty). \]

Finally, we find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities \( -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \) and \( x \in (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty) \):
\[ (-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}) \cap ((-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)) = (-\sqrt{3}, 0) \cup (0, \sqrt{3}). \]

Thus, the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) are:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[-8 + 36 = \frac{1728}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[28 = \frac{1728}{p^3}.\]
Solving for \(p^3\), we get:
\[p^3 = \frac{1728}{28} = \frac{432}{7}.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

However, we need to check if this value is consistent with the original equations. Instead, we can use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try to find a simpler solution.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

"To find the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we need to consider the total length of the track and how it is composed of the straight and curved sections. The track consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of each straight side by \( L \) meters and the radius of each semicircle by \( R \) meters. The circumference of a full circle is \( 2\pi R \), so the length of one semicircle is \( \pi R \). Since there are two semicircles, the total length of the curved sections is \( 2\pi R \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the two semicircles:
\[
2L + 2\pi R = 400
\]
We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[
L + \pi R = 200
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( R \), we get:
\[
L = 200 - \pi R
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is the product of its length and width. The width of the field is equal to the diameter of the semicircles, which is \( 2R \). Therefore, the area \( A \) is:
\[
A = L \times 2R
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) from the previous equation, we get:
\[
A = (200 - \pi R) \times 2R
\]
Expanding this expression, we have:
\[
A = 400R - 2\pi R^2
\]

To find the value of \( R \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( R \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dR} = 400 - 4\pi R
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
400 - 4\pi R = 0
\]
Solving for \( R \), we find:
\[
R = \frac{100}{\pi}
\]

Now, we substitute \( R = \frac{100}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 100 = 100

Finally, we substitute \( L = 100 \) and \( R = \frac{100}{\pi} \) into the area formula:
\[
A = 100 \times 2 \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = 200 \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = \frac{20000}{\pi}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by noting that \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\). Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can use the properties of right triangles and trigonometric identities to find \(\sin{T}\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle{R}\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\), then \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(RS\):
\[
RS^2 + ST^2 = RT^2

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[

\[

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors: \( x = 0 \) and \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution. Testing other possible rational roots or using numerical methods would show that there are no other real roots greater than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, given the distances from \( P \) to five of its vertices. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between opposite vertices is the same.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \). We are given the distances from \( P \) to five of these vertices: \( PA = 3 \), \( PB = 7 \), \( PC = 8 \), \( PD = 9 \), and \( PE = 11 \). We need to find the distance \( PF \).

Since \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite vertices, the distance \( AF \) is the same as the distance between any other pair of opposite vertices. The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to three pairs of opposite vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices, which is \( 6 \) times the square of the edge length of the octahedron.

However, we can use a simpler approach by considering the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices that do not form a tetrahedron with \( P \) as the center is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices. This is because the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is constant.

Let's use the vertices \( A, B, C, D \) and \( E \). The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to these five vertices is:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is constant, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is also 324 plus the square of the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( F \). Therefore, we have:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 324 + PF^2
\]

But we also know that:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 324 + PF^2
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices that do not form a tetrahedron with \( P \) as the center is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices, we have:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 = 324

"To solve the problem, we start with the formula for force, which is given by:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration (or versnelling in Afrikaans).

Given that Jen and Jack are applying the same force to their respective balls, we can set their forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{Jen}} = F_{\text{Jack}} \]

Using the formula for force, we can express this as:

\[ m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \]

We know the masses of the balls:
- Mass of Jen's ball, \( m_{\text{Jen}} = 200 \) g
- Mass of Jack's ball, \( m_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \) g

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's ball, which is:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} \]

From the equation \( m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \), we can rearrange it to solve for the ratio of the accelerations:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{m_{\text{Jack}}}{m_{\text{Jen}}} \]

Substituting the known masses:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} \]

"To determine how many digits are common between the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits: the digits in \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, 6 and the digits in \(1165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, 5. The common digits are 1, 5, and 6.

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

We need to determine the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. Therefore, we have:

\[
a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
a + b + c = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

Next, we need to find the product \(abc\). We have:

\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so instead, we can use the fact that the roots of the polynomial can be expressed in a specific form. The polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) can be factored as:

\[
(x^2 + x + \sqrt{2})(x^2 + x - \sqrt{2}) = 0.
\]

The roots of \(x^2 + x + \sqrt{2} = 0\) are:

\[
\alpha_1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 - 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}, \quad \alpha_2 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 - 4\sqrt{2}}}{2},

and the roots of \(x^2 + x - \sqrt{2} = 0\) are:

\[
\alpha_3 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}, \quad \alpha_4 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}.

Now, we can calculate the expressions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[

\]

Since \(a = 0\), we have \(abc = 0\). Therefore, the product \(bc\) must be 0. This implies that either \(b = 0\) or \(c = 0\). However, from the expressions for \(b\) and \(c\), we see that neither \(b\) nor \(c\) is necessarily 0. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of \(b\) and \(c\) is equal to the sum of the squares of the roots taken two at a time, which is given by:

\[
b^2 + c^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 = 2.

Thus, the values of \(b\) and \(c\) must be \(\pm 1\). Since \(b\) and \(c\) are symmetric, we can conclude that \(b = 1\) and \(c = -1\) or \(b = -1\) and \(c = 1\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Assume \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any vertex. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is given by:

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

For \(P\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

Squaring both sides, we get:

\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2

\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:

\]
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:

- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):

- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money was left over after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie combined their earnings and exchanged the coins for notes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money earned by all four individuals.
2. Determine the number of dollars in the total amount.
3. Determine the number of cents in the total amount.
4. Exchange the cents for notes and find the leftover cents.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money earned by all four individuals:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \$27.47 + \$35.23 + \$37.37 + \$26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money earned is \$126.59.

Next, we determine the number of dollars in the total amount:
\[
\text{Number of dollars} = 126
\]

The number of cents in the total amount is:
\[
\text{Number of cents} = 59
\]

When we exchange the cents for notes, we can exchange 100 cents for a dollar note. Since we only have 59 cents, we cannot exchange any cents for a dollar note. Therefore, the leftover cents are:
\[
\text{Leftover cents} = 59
\]

Thus, the amount of money left over after they exchanged the coins for notes is \(\boxed{59}\) cents.","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the class average on the test, we need to calculate the total score for all students and then divide that by the number of students. Here are the steps:

1. Determine the total score for the students who scored 80.
2. Determine the total score for the students who scored 90.
3. Determine the total score for the students who scored 100.
4. Add up all these total scores to get the overall total score.
5. Divide the overall total score by the number of students in the class.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total score for the students who scored 80 is:
   \[
   20 \times 80 = 1600
   \]

2. The total score for the students who scored 90 is:
   \[
   8 \times 90 = 720
   \]

3. The total score for the students who scored 100 is:
   \[
   2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

4. The overall total score is the sum of these individual total scores:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

5. The class average is the overall total score divided by the number of students in the class:
   \[
   \frac{2520}{30} = 84
   \]

Therefore, the class average on the test is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):
- The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]
- The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum is:
  \[
  3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]
- The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top right to the bottom left contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 5 + 2 = 15
  \]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Jim loops than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim loops diagonally across the field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha loops around the field along the length and the width. Therefore, the total distance she travels is:
\[
2 \times \text{length} + 2 \times \text{width} = 2 \times 400 + 2 \times 300 = 800 + 600 = 1400 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Martha travels 1400 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
1400 - 500 = 900 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore, Jim loops \(\boxed{900}\) feet less than Martha.","[900, '900']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"To find the possible values of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Next, we need to find the value of the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
