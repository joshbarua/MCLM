"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i
   \]
   \[
   -3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i - 3(-1) = -3i + 3 = 3 - 3i
   \]
   Add the two results together:
   \[
   1 + i + 3 - 3i = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system:**
   Add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Combining these results, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

4. Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization. We know that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

So, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block, which is \(3! = 6\).

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720
\]

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot x^{-6}
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \cdot x^0

\[
= \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[

\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right)
\]
\[
= -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = ((7k + 2) + 2)((7k + 2) + 4)((7k + 2) + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).
\]

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:
\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, calculate \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24,
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must rotate around its center to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and it will look the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \) degrees. This is because a full rotation is \( 360^\circ \), and dividing this by the number of sides gives the smallest angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself.

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the diagonals bisect each other, these midpoints must be the same. Therefore, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. If we assume \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(B\), then the diagonals would be \(AB\) and \(CD\), and the midpoints would be the same.

The midpoint of diagonal \(AB\) is:
\[

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid.

The correct arrangement is that \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(C\), then the diagonals would be \(AC\) and \(BD\), and the midpoints would be the same. The correct solution is:

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   We can factorize the quadratic expression as follows:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   Let \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[

Thus, we have:

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[9 + 8 = 17.\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36.\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"To solve the problem, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Two treeks and one goolee are as heavy as three squigs and one goolee.
2. Two treeks and one goolee are as heavy as one squig.
3. Two treeks and one goolee are as heavy as one squig.

We can translate these relationships into the following equations:

1. \( 2T + G = 3S + G \)
2. \( 2T + G = S \)

First, let's simplify the first equation by subtracting \( G \) from both sides:

\[ 2T = 3S \]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( 2T = 3S \)
2. \( 2T + G = S \)

We can solve the first equation for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{3S}{2} \]

Next, we substitute \( T = \frac{3S}{2} \) into the second equation:

\[ 2\left(\frac{3S}{2}\right) + G = S \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ 3S + G = S \]

Subtract \( S \) from both sides:

\[ 2S + G = 0 \]

Solve for \( G \):

\[ G = -2S \]

Now we have the weights of the treeks and squigs in terms of \( S \):

- \( T = \frac{3S}{2} \)
- \( G = -2S \)

We need to find how many treeks are equivalent to the weight of one squig. Let \( x \) be the number of treeks that equal the weight of one squig. Therefore, we have:

\[ xT = S \]

Substitute \( T = \frac{3S}{2} \) into the equation:

\[ x\left(\frac{3S}{2}\right) = S \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[ 3xS = 2S \]

Divide both sides by \( S \) (assuming \( S \neq 0 \)):

\[ 3x = 2 \]

Solve for \( x \):

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

\[

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\):
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\):
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\):
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

   This is true.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), which must equal \(6\):
   \[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height (or in this case, the height of the water in the tank).

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank multiplied by the height of the water added per hour. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Given that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour, we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) defined piecewise:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first piece \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x \geq a \).
2. **Behavior**: Since \( a \) is a constant, the function \( ax^2 \) is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).
3. **Minimum/Maximum**: 
   - If \( a > 0 \), the minimum value occurs at \( x = a \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]
   - If \( a < 0 \), the maximum value occurs at \( x = a \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]

### Step 2: Analyze the second piece \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x < a \).
2. **Behavior**: This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \).
3. **Value at \( x = a \)**: The value of the function as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left is:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
   \]

### Step 3: Determine the conditions for intersection with horizontal lines

For the graph of \( f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, we need to ensure that:

1. The function \( f(x) \) must cover all values from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \).
2. The minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x < a \).

### Step 4: Set up the inequalities

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - The minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( a^3 \).
   - The maximum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x < a \) is \( a^2 + 2a \).
   - We need:
     \[
     a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.
     \]
   - Factoring out \( a \):
     \[
     a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.
     \]
   - Factoring the quadratic:
     \[
     a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.
     \]
   - The roots are \( a = 0, 2, -1 \). Testing intervals gives:
     - \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2] \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - The maximum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( a^3 \).
   - The minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x < a \) is \( a^2 + 2a \).
   - We need:
     \[
     a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a.
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0.
     \]
   - This is the same inequality as before, but we are looking for \( a < 0 \):
     - The valid interval is \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\). So, we need to solve the system:
\[
y = \lambda x(1 - x) \quad \text{and} \quad x = \lambda y(1 - y).
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) \implies x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) \implies x(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\)
2. \(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0\).

The first case \(x = 0\) corresponds to the fixed point \(x = 0\), which we are not interested in since we want \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we consider the second case:
\[
1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Let's test the boundary values of \(x\):
- If \(x = 1\), then \(\lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda \cdot 1 + \lambda \cdot 1^2) = 0 \neq 1\). So, \(x = 1\) is not a solution.
- If \(x = 0\), then \(\lambda^2 (1 - 0)(1 - \lambda \cdot 0 + \lambda \cdot 0^2) = \lambda^2 \neq 1\). So, \(x = 0\) is not a solution.

Now, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\) has a solution in the interval \((0,1)\) that is not equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify \(\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator is \(\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ\).

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify \(\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\cos 55^\circ.

So, the denominator is \(-\cos 55^\circ\).

Now, we can find \(\tan \theta\):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the product.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function in terms of trigonometric identities. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only relevant solution is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). If \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \), then \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \). Substituting back, we get \( y = \sin \phi = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \) and \( x = \sin \theta \). Therefore, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \) for some \( \theta \) in the interval \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2} \).

In this case, the function value is:

The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the given equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, we know that \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, we can deduce that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and using properties of medians and similar triangles.

1. **Identify the properties of the medians and the centroid:**
   - The medians \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \) of triangle \( ABC \) intersect at the centroid \( G \).
   - The centroid \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

2. **Determine the area of triangle \( AGD \):**
   - Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides triangle \( ABC \) into six smaller triangles of equal area.
   - Therefore, the area of triangle \( AGD \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).
   - Given that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AGD \) is \( \frac{144}{6} = 24 \).

3. **Determine the area of triangle \( AGN \):**
   - Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and \( G \) divides \( BE \) in the ratio 2:1, \( N \) divides \( AC \) in the ratio 2:1.
   - Therefore, triangle \( AGN \) is similar to triangle \( ABE \) with a similarity ratio of 2:3.
   - The area of triangle \( AGN \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABE \).
   - Since triangle \( ABE \) is half of triangle \( ABC \) (because \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AC \)), the area of triangle \( ABE \) is \( \frac{144}{2} = 72 \).
   - Therefore, the area of triangle \( AGN \) is \( \frac{4}{9} \times 72 = 32 \).

4. **Determine the area of triangle \( ENG \):**
   - Since \( G \) divides \( BE \) in the ratio 2:1, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the area of triangle \( AGN \).

- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:

- Let \( f \) be the number of five-cent coins.

According to the problem, Hillary has a total of 11 coins, and the total value of these coins is 75 cents. We can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:

2. \( 10t + 5f = 75 \) (the total value of the coins, where each ten-cent coin is worth 10 cents and each five-cent coin is worth 5 cents)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ 2t + f = 15 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( t + f = 11 \)
2. \( 2t + f = 15 \)

To eliminate \( f \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (2t + f) - (t + f) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2t + f - t - f = 4 \]
\[ t = 4 \]

Now that we know \( t = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( f \):

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 3^2, and 5^2. This means the number must end in 00 (to be divisible by 2 and 5^2) and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 (to be divisible by 3^2).

"To find the sum of the digits in the final decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal. Performing the division, we get:

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use properties of the sine function and symmetry. First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x)\) can be simplified as follows:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Let \(x = 20^\circ\), then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is \(1070^\circ + x\). Using the formula for the sum of the interior angles, we can write:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We can find the range for \(n\) by first finding the maximum possible value for \(x\), which is just less than \(180^\circ\). If \(x\) were exactly \(180^\circ\), the equation would be:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + 180
\]
\[
180(n-2) = 1250

\[
n-2 = \frac{1250}{180}

\[

Since \(n\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(n\) is 8. Now, we check if \(n = 8\) is a valid solution by calculating the sum of the interior angles of an octagon:

\[

If the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), then the missing angle \(x\) is:

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the congruence:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes

"To determine the average price of Juan's 1970s stamps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s.
2. Determine the cost of each type of stamp.
3. Calculate the total cost for all the stamps in the 1970s.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to find the average price.

Let's start with the data provided:

- Number of Brazilian stamps: 12
- Number of French stamps: 8
- Number of Peruvian stamps: 12
- Number of Spanish stamps: 10

The cost of each stamp is:
- Brazilian stamp: 6 cents
- French stamp: 6 cents
- Peruvian stamp: 4 cents
- Spanish stamp: 5 cents

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of stamp:
- Total cost for Brazilian stamps: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents
- Total cost for French stamps: \(8 \times 6 = 48\) cents
- Total cost for Peruvian stamps: \(12 \times 4 = 48\) cents
- Total cost for Spanish stamps: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) cents

Next, we find the total cost for all the stamps in the 1970s:
\[72 + 48 + 48 + 50 = 218 \text{ cents}\]

Now, we calculate the total number of stamps in the 1970s:
\[12 + 8 + 12 + 10 = 42\]

Finally, we find the average price of the stamps by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps:
\[\text{Average price} = \frac{218}{42} \approx 5.1905\]

Rounding 5.1905 to the nearest tenth of a cent, we get:
\[5.2\]

Therefore, the average price of Juan's 1970s stamps is \(\boxed{5.2}\) cents.","[5.20000000000000, '5.2']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) cross each other when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form one segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the other segment. This is given by:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]
   However, since the order of the segments does not matter, we need to consider the permutations of the points, which gives us:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]

2. **Determine the number of ways the segments can cross:**
   For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to cross, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). There are 2 such arrangements for each pair of points, and since there are 6 ways to pair the points, the number of ways the segments can cross is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) cross each other is the ratio of the number of ways the segments can cross to the total number of ways to pair the points:
   \[
   \frac{12}{24} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) cross each other is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the area of the larger circle and the smaller circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The radius of the smaller circle is 1, so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The total area of the skyggelagte region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the skyggelagte region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The skyggelagte region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle with the same central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The total area of the skyggelagte region is the sum of these two areas:
\[
2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
\]
We set this equal to the area of the skyggelagte region:

\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180}{3} = 120

"To determine how many cylindrical barrels are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical barrels and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the volume of one barrel.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical barrel. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical barrel, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical barrels are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical barrel:
\[ \text{Number of barrels} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical barrels needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, the expression becomes \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B)
\]

Notice that this is a product of the form \((x + y)(x - y)\), which simplifies to \(x^2 - y^2\). Here, \(x = \sin A \cos B\) and \(y = \cos A \sin B\), so we have:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B) = (\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the expression:
\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee with all members from the same party.

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 Republicans and 6 Democrats):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with all members from the same party. There are two cases to consider: all members are Republicans or all members are Democrats.

1. The number of ways to form a subcommittee with all 5 members as Republicans is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

2. The number of ways to form a subcommittee with all 5 members as Democrats is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Add these two cases together to get the total number of ways to form a subcommittee with all members from the same party:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62

Finally, subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with all members from the same party from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:
\[

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Now, we substitute these values into the difference of squares formula:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the average of these three integers. The average is given by:
\[\text{Average} = \frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1.\]

According to the problem, the product of the three integers divided by their average is 24. Therefore, we can write:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24.\]

Since \(x+1 \neq 0\), we can cancel \(x+1\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[x(x+2) = 24.\]

Expanding the left side, we get:
\[x^2 + 2x = 24.\]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0.\]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-24\) and add up to \(2\). These numbers are \(6\) and \(-4\). Therefore, we can write:
\[(x + 6)(x - 4) = 0.\]

Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:
\[x + 6 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 4 = 0.\]
\[x = -6 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4.\]

If \(x = -6\), the three consecutive integers are \(-6\), \(-5\), and \(-4\). The product of these integers is:
\[-6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120,\]
which is not equal to 120. Therefore, \(x = -6\) is not a solution.

If \(x = 4\), the three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The product of these integers is:
\[4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120,\]
which is equal to 120. Therefore, \(x = 4\) is a solution.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta\).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Place \(M\) at the origin \((0,0)\), so \(A\) is at \((0,11)\). Let \(B\) be at \((-x,0)\) and \(C\) be at \((x,0)\). Since \(AB = AC\), we have:
\[
AB = \sqrt{x^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}
\]
\[
AC = \sqrt{x^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}
\]
Thus, \(AB = AC = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}\).

Now, point \(D\) is at \((0,1)\). We need to find \(\angle BDC\) and \(\angle BAC\). Using the tangent function in triangles \(BDM\) and \(CDM\), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{x}{1} = x
\]
\[
\tan \angle CDM = \frac{x}{1} = x
\]
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \tan (\angle BDM + \angle CDM) = \tan (2\arctan x) = \frac{2x}{1 - x^2}
\]

We know that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC = 6\theta\). Using the tangent function for \(\angle BAC\), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BAC = \tan 2\theta = \frac{2\tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}
\]
Since \(\tan \theta = \frac{x}{11}\), we get:
\[
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{x}{11}}{1 - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{2x}{11}}{1 - \frac{x^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{2x}{11}}{\frac{121 - x^2}{121}} = \frac{2x \cdot 121}{11 \cdot (121 - x^2)} = \frac{22x}{121 - x^2}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\tan \angle BDC\), we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 - x^2} = \frac{22x}{121 - x^2}
\]
Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
2x(121 - x^2) = 22x(1 - x^2)

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. Given that the sum is \(3^7\), we first calculate \(3^7\):

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

The sum of 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as the product of the number of integers and the average of these integers. Let the first integer be \(x\). Then the 27 consecutive integers are \(x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26\). The sum of these integers is:

\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + \cdots + (x+26)

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(x\), the last term \(x+26\), and 27 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (x + (x+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2x + 26) = 27 \times (x + 13)
\]

We know that this sum is equal to \(2187\), so we set up the equation:

"To determine for which real values of \( x \) the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) holds, we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ (x^2)^2 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), we can simplify this to:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:
\[ -2 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies further to:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]
Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use the identity for the sum of cubes and the given equations.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this equation as:
\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.\]
Adding and subtracting \(xyz\) in each term, we get:
\[xy(y + x + z - z) + xz(z + x + y - y) + yz(z + y + x - x) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[xy(x + y + z) + xz(x + y + z) + yz(x + y + z) - 3xyz = 12,\]
or
\[(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which further simplifies to
\[(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12 = 12,\]
or
\[(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = 24.\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(24 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(24 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left(\frac{576}{p^2} - 3p\right),\]
or
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 3p^3}{p^2},\]

\[-8 = \frac{24(576 - 3p^3)}{p^3},\]

1. Calculate the number of male bus riders for each class.
2. Calculate the number of female bus riders for each class.
3. Determine the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders for each class.
4. Find the class for which this ratio is closest to \(1.35\).

Let's start with the calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of male bus riders for each class
- **9th class**: \(41.1\%\) of 300
  \[
  0.411 \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123
  \]
- **10th class**: \(34.4\%\) of 300

### Step 2: Calculate the number of female bus riders for each class
- **9th class**: \(39.4\%\) of 300
  \[
  0.394 \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118

- **10th class**: \(33.1\%\) of 300
  \[
  0.331 \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99
  \]
- **11th class**: \(13.8\%\) of 300
  \[
  0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41
  \]
- **12th class**: \(8.6\%\) of 300
  \[
  0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26

### Step 3: Determine the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders for each class
- **9th class**: \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.0424\)
- **10th class**: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.0404\)

The ratio for the 12th class is \(1.3462\), which is the closest to \(1.35\).

Therefore, the class for which the number of male bus riders is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders is the \(\boxed{12}\)th class.","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

In boxed form, the answer is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the dimensions of the field. Let the length of the field be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters. The track consists of two straight sides of the field and two semicircles at the ends, with the diameter of each semicircle equal to the width \( W \) of the field. The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

The length of each straight side is \( L \), and the circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi W / 2 \). Therefore, the total length of the track is:
\[
2L + 2 \left( \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) = 2L + \pi W
\]
We know that the total length of the track is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W \implies L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) W = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
We substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 100 = 100
\]
The area of the field is:
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2.

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2

   Simplifying this, we get:

   \[

3. **Determine \(\sin{T}\):**
   In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side to that angle divided by the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is the adjacent side to angle \(R\), which is \(\sqrt{21}\), and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, we have:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance \(d\) from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((x, y)\) is given by the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root. Let \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x - \sqrt{2})(x + \sqrt{2}) \]

Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \), we get:

\[ x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2} \]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( d \) is:

\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

The minimum distance can be expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:

f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center.

However, for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is also equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the opposite vertices. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices.

Let the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex be \( x \). Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is constant, we can write:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}

We can also write:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = (3^2 + 11^2) + (7^2 + 9^2) + (8^2 + x^2)

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices is equal, we can pair the distances:
\[
3^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 121 = 130
\]
\[
7^2 + 9^2 = 49 + 81 = 130

Therefore, we have:

\[
260 + 64 + x^2 = \text{constant}

\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}

Since the constant is the same, we can conclude that:

"To find the ratio of the acceleration of Jens' softball to Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[
F = m \cdot a
\]

Given that both Jens and Jack apply the same force (F) when throwing their respective balls, we can set up the following equations for their masses and accelerations:

1. For Jack's baseball:
   \[
   F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}}
   \]
   where \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \, \text{g} \).

2. For Jens' softball:
   \[
   F = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}}
   \]
   where \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \, \text{g} \).

Since the force is the same for both, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[
m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}}
\]

Substituting the masses into the equation gives:

\[
150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} = 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}}
\]

Now, we can solve for the ratio of the accelerations:

\[
\frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200}

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 50:

"To determine how many of the same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We list the digits in each representation:

"To determine the number of handshakes that took place at the meeting, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 6 hexes and 10 trolls.
2. Each hex shakes hands with each troll.
3. No hex shakes hands with another hex.
4. No troll shakes hands with another troll.

Since each of the 6 hexes shakes hands with each of the 10 trolls, the total number of handshakes is calculated by multiplying the number of hexes by the number of trolls. This is because each hex shakes hands with each troll exactly once.

The calculation is as follows:
\[ 6 \text{ hexes} \times 10 \text{ trolls} = 60 \text{ handshakes} \]

Therefore, the total number of handshakes that took place at the meeting is \(\boxed{60}\).","[60, '60']",60,"[60, '60']",True
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0).
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2.

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

We know that the sum of these expressions is:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product of these expressions. We use the identity for the product of sums of products of roots:
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so we use another approach. We know that the roots of the polynomial can be expressed in terms of complex numbers. By symmetry and the fact that the polynomial is palindromic (the coefficients read the same forwards and backwards), the roots can be paired as complex conjugates. Let's assume the roots are \(\alpha, \overline{\alpha}, \beta, \overline{\beta}\). Then:
\[
S_1 = \alpha\overline{\alpha} + \beta\overline{\beta} = |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha\beta + \overline{\alpha}\overline{\beta} = \alpha\beta + \overline{\alpha\beta} = 2\operatorname{Re}(\alpha\beta),
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha\overline{\beta} + \overline{\alpha}\beta = \overline{\alpha\overline{\beta}} + \alpha\overline{\beta} = 2\operatorname{Re}(\alpha\overline{\beta}).
\]

Since \(|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2\) is a real number and \(2\operatorname{Re}(\alpha\beta)\) and \(2\operatorname{Re}(\alpha\overline{\beta})\) are also real numbers, we need to determine their specific values. Using the fact that the product of the roots taken two at a time is zero, we can deduce that the roots must be such that the expressions \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are symmetric and their sum is zero. The only way this can happen is if two of these expressions are equal and the third is the negative of their sum.

By symmetry and the properties of the roots, we can conclude that the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\{2, -1, -1\}\).

"To determine the cost of one blyant, we start by defining the variables for the costs of the blyants and the jumbo viskelær. Let \( b \) be the cost of one blyant in dollars and \( j \) be the cost of one jumbo viskelær in dollars. We can then set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. \( 3b + j = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5b + j = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( j \), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
(5b + j) - (3b + j) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2b = 0.58
\]

Next, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[
b = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]

Since the cost of one blyant is asked in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

\[
b = 0.29 \times 100 = 29

Therefore, the cost of one blyant is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True

First, we note that \(500 = 5^3 \times 2^2\). To simplify the division, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \(4\) to make the denominator a power of 10:
\[

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Let the lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) be \(2a\) and \(2b\) respectively, so that \(k = \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{2a}{2b} = \frac{a}{b}\). The vertices of the rectangle are then \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if its distance to \(O\) is less than its distance to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

This is the equation of a line. Similarly, we can find the equations of the lines that define the regions where \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\):

\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

\[

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\right) \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:

Next, we use the quotient to find the remainder \(r\) by substituting \(q\) back into the division algorithm:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money was left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie vekslet myntene til sedler, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they earned.
2. Determine the amount of money that can be vekset til sedler.
3. Subtract the amount vekset til sedler from the total amount to find the remaining money.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money they earned.**

Linda earned \$27.47.
Sherry earned \$35.23.
June earned \$37.37.
Connie earned \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

First, add 27.47 and 35.23:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70

Next, add 37.37 to 62.70:

\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07

Finally, add 26.52 to 100.07:

\[

So, the total amount of money they earned is \$126.59.

**Step 2: Determine the amount of money that can be vekset til sedler.**

Since sedler are in whole dollars, we can only vekset the whole dollar part of the total amount. The whole dollar part of \$126.59 is \$126.

**Step 3: Subtract the amount vekset til sedler from the total amount to find the remaining money.**

The remaining money is:

\[

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we have:

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
1 = n - 6

Next, we add 6 to both sides:
\[

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \). To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):

The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[

The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum of these numbers is:

The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 = 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum of these numbers is:

"To determine how many feet less Jim travels compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally across the rectangular mark. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the mark).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[

Calculating the squares, we get:

Let's assume the distances between the points are as follows (since the specific distances are not provided in the problem, we will use a general approach):

- \(AB = d_{AB}\)
- \(AC = d_{AC}\)
- \(AD = d_{AD}\)
- \(BC = d_{BC}\)
- \(BD = d_{BD}\)
- \(CD = d_{CD}\)

We need to find the minimum of the total distances for all possible paths that visit each point exactly once. There are \(3! = 6\) permutations of the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) for each starting point \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\). However, since the problem is symmetric, we can consider the paths starting from point \(A\) and then multiply the result by 4.

4. \(A \to C \to D \to B\)
5. \(A \to D \to B \to C\)

The total distance for each path is:

4. \(d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB}\)
5. \(d_{AD} + d_{DB} + d_{BC}\)
6. \(d_{AD} + d_{DC} + d_{CB}\)

To find the minimum distance, we need to compare these six expressions. The minimum of these six expressions will be the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from point \(A\) and visiting the other three points exactly once.

Since the problem is symmetric, the minimum distance starting from any other point \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) will be the same as the minimum distance starting from point \(A\). Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point and visiting the other three points exactly once is the minimum of the six expressions above.
