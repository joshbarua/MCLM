"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(DE = 7\), we need to find the length of \(DF\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(DE = 7\). Since \(DE\) is the opposite side to angle \(D\) and \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{DE}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(DE\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DF\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) and \( c \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \),
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{6i}{2} + i^2 \frac{6i}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the exponent of \(x\) in the term is zero (since a constant term has no \(x\)). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100 x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6} = -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6}
\]

Combining these, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100 x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot x^6 \cdot \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion is:

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2) = (7k + 2 + 2) = 7k + 4
\]
\[
(n + 4) = (7k + 2 + 4) = 7k + 6
\]
\[
(n + 6) = (7k + 2 + 6) = 7k + 8
\]

Now, the expression becomes:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

Since we are interested in the remainder when this expression is divided by 7, we can simplify each term modulo 7:

\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

Thus, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7 is equivalent to:

First, calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[

Now, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

\[

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we start by using the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Let the vertices of the parallelogram be \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\).

The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these midpoints must be the same. Therefore, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's assume \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(B\). Then the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\), but we need to check the other possible configuration.

If \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(C\), then the midpoint of diagonal \(CD\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(AB\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AB\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of diagonal \(CD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these midpoints must be the same. Therefore, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this configuration is not possible either.

Therefore, we need to consider the correct configuration where \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(A\). The correct configuration is:

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factorize the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is \( 2x \), so:
\[ 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]

Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

\[

\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is concave down at every point, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its second derivative.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

First, we find the first derivative of \(f(x)\):
\[ f'(x) = \begin{cases} 2ax & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

Next, we find the second derivative of \(f(x)\):
\[ f''(x) = \begin{cases} 2a & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ 0 & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to be concave down at every point, the second derivative \(f''(x)\) must be less than or equal to zero at every point. From the second derivative, we see that:
\[ f''(x) = 2a \quad \text{for } x \geq a, \]
\[ f''(x) = 0 \quad \text{for } x < a. \]

Since \(f''(x) = 0\) for \(x < a\) does not violate the condition of being concave down, we only need to ensure that \(f''(x) = 2a \leq 0\) for \(x \geq a\). This implies:
\[ 2a \leq 0, \]
\[ a \leq 0. \]

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this condition is \(a = 0\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that for any \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\), there exists an \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (assuming \(\lambda \neq 0\)). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:

\[ 0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1. \]

This inequality holds if and only if \(\lambda \geq 1\). Therefore, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that for any \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\), there exists an \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need \(f(f(x)) = x\):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

This is a quartic equation in \(x\). To simplify, let's consider the case when \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):

\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}, \]
\[ f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \cdot \frac{4 - \lambda}{4} = \frac{\lambda^2 (4 - \lambda)}{16}. \]

We need:

\[ \frac{\lambda^2 (4 - \lambda)}{16} = \frac{1}{2}, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (4 - \lambda) = 8, \]
\[ 4\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 = 8, \]
\[ \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0. \]

We can test possible rational roots of this polynomial. Testing \(\lambda = 2\):

\[ 2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0. \]

So, \(\lambda = 2\) is a root. We can factor \(\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8\) as:

\[ (\lambda - 2)(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4) = 0. \]

The quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4 = 0\) has roots:

\[ \lambda = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}. \]

Since \(\lambda\) must be in the interval \([0,4]\), we discard \(\lambda = 1 - \sqrt{5}\) because it is negative. Therefore, the possible values of \(\lambda\) are:

\[ \lambda = 2, \quad \lambda = 1 + \sqrt{5}. \]

However, we need to check if these values satisfy the condition that for any \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\), there exists an \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). For \(\lambda = 1 + \sqrt{5}\), the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \sqrt{5} - 1\), which is in \([0,1]\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 1 + \sqrt{5}\) does not satisfy the condition.

Thus, the only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is:

"To find the value of \(\theta\) for the given expression, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

The given expression is:

\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Next, let's simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ

We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we first need to identify the letters and their frequencies. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Here, the letter E appears twice and the letter L appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since all higher powers of 5 will result in fractions less than 1, their integer parts will be 0. Therefore, we sum the values:

\[
8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots = 9

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product, i.e., \(\frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v}\|\).

Here, \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}

So, the cross product is \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \( G \) of triangle \( ABC \).

Given that \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through \( G \), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the vertex to the parallel line and the base. Since \( G \) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( 2:3 \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).

Therefore, the only way to get an even sum is to select two odd numbers. The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from 5 odd numbers is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{2} \).

The total number of ways to choose 2 numbers from 6 numbers is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \).

The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. So, we have:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\binom{5}{2}}{\binom{6}{2}} = \frac{\frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1}}{\frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the two randomly selected prime numbers is even is \(\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}\).","[2/3, '\\frac{2}{3}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To find the value of \( b \) when the point \( (a, b) \) lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \) and \( a = 4 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = a \) and \( y = b \) into the equation of the line.
2. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation.
3. Solve for \( b \).

Let's start with the equation of the line:

"To find the smallest positive product of 450 whose digits are all either 0 or 1, we start by factorizing 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

We need to form a product of these factors such that the resulting number has only the digits 0 and 1. Let's consider the possible combinations of these factors:

1. \( 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 450 \) (This number has digits 4 and 5, so it is not valid.)
2. \( 2 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 90 \) (This number has digits 9 and 0, so it is not valid.)

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its exterior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we need to use the property that the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \(360^\circ\). This property holds true regardless of the number of sides of the polygon.

Given that the sum of the exterior angles is \(1070^\circ\), it is clear that there is a mistake in the problem statement because the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon cannot exceed \(360^\circ\). Therefore, it is impossible for a polygon to have a sum of exterior angles equal to \(1070^\circ\).

Thus, the correct interpretation should be that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

We set this equal to \(1070^\circ\) and solve for \(n\):

\[

\]

First, we divide both sides by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
n-2 = \frac{107}{18}

\[
n-2 \approx 5.9444

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

"To solve for the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to find \( t \) such that:

\[ (t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2 modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the values from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we move to the second step. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Next, we proceed to the third step. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our problem, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the expression inside the sine function becomes

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x).
\]

So the equation simplifies to

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

So the equation becomes

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply to get

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:

\[

To find \(h\), we need to express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) and \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides is equal:

However, this is not correct because we need to consider the correct similar triangles. The correct approach is to use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and the height is the same.

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circumference of the circle.

That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose and arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the points.

Next, we need to count the number of these permutations where the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, the points must be in an alternating pattern. There are 2 possible alternating patterns for any given pair of points \(A\) and \(B\):
1. \(A, C, B, D\)
2. \(A, D, B, C\)

For each pair of points \(A\) and \(B\), there are 2 possible choices for \(C\) and \(D\) that will result in an intersection.

For each of these choices, there are 2 ways to choose \(C\) and \(D\) such that the chords intersect. Therefore, the total number of permutations where the chords intersect is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).

However, we have overcounted because each pair of chords is counted twice (once for each order of the points). Therefore, the correct number of permutations where the chords intersect is \(12\).

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable permutations to the total number of permutations:

\[
\theta_{\text{degrees}} = \frac{10\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{10 \times 180}{3} = 600
\]

However, this angle exceeds \( 360^\circ \), which indicates that we need to find the equivalent angle within the range of \( 0^\circ \) to \( 360^\circ \). We can find the equivalent angle by subtracting \( 360^\circ \):
\[
\theta_{\text{degrees}} = 600 - 360 = 240

"To determine how many booklets are needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the booklets and the tank and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the volume of one booklet.

First, let's calculate the volume of one booklet. The booklet is in the shape of a cylinder with a height of 8 cm and a radius of \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) cm. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
Substituting the values for the radius and height, we get:
\[
V_{\text{booklet}} = \pi (1.5)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 2.25 \cdot 8 = 18\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the tank. The tank is in the shape of a sphere with a radius of 6 cm. The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by the formula:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
Substituting the value for the radius, we get:
\[
V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many booklets are required to fill the tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the tank by the volume of one booklet:
\[
\text{Number of booklets} = \frac{V_{\text{tank}}}{V_{\text{booklet}}} = \frac{288\pi}{18\pi} = \frac{288}{18} = 16

Therefore, the number of booklets needed to fill the tank is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",4,"[4, '4']",False

"To determine the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a Senate committee consisting of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that at least one member from each party must be included, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all Democrats:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party:**
   This is the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all Republicans and the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all Democrats:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = 2\theta \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta \).

The point \( D \) lies on \( AM \) such that \( AD = 10 \), so \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC = 6\theta \). We can use the tangent function in \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \).

In \( \triangle BDM \):
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{BM}{1} = BM
\]

In \( \triangle CDM \):
\[
\tan \angle CDM = \frac{CM}{DM} = \frac{CM}{1} = CM
\]

Since \( \angle BDC = \angle BDM + \angle CDM \), we have:
\[
\tan 6\theta = \tan (\angle BDM + \angle CDM) = \frac{\tan \angle BDM + \tan \angle CDM}{1 - \tan \angle BDM \tan \angle CDM} = \frac{BM + CM}{1 - BM \cdot CM}
\]

Given that \( BM = CM \) (since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \)), let \( BM = CM = x \). Then:
\[
\tan 6\theta = \frac{2x}{1 - x^2}
\]

We also know that:
\[
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}
\]

Using the triple angle identity for tangent:
\[
\tan 6\theta = \frac{3 \tan 2\theta - \tan^3 2\theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 2\theta}
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \tan 6\theta = \frac{2x}{1 - x^2} \) and \( \tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta} \). We can use the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the angles.

Since \( \tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11} \), we have:
\[
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{x}{11}}{1 - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{2x}{11}}{1 - \frac{x^2}{121}} = \frac{2x}{11} \cdot \frac{121}{121 - x^2} = \frac{22x}{121 - x^2}
\]

Using the triple angle identity:
\[
\tan 6\theta = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{22x}{121 - x^2} - \left(\frac{22x}{121 - x^2}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{22x}{121 - x^2}\right)^2}
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \tan 6\theta = \frac{2x}{1 - x^2} \) and \( \tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta} \). We can use the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the angles.

Since \( \tan 6\theta = \frac{2x}{1 - x^2} \) and \( \tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta} \), we can solve for \( x \).

Finally, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} + 2x

Given that \( x = 5 \), we have:

"To find the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ (x^2)^2 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), we can drop the absolute value:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:
\[ -2 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies to:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

"Let the length of the square be \( s \) meters. The width of the square is also \( s \) meters. The two semicircles have a radius of \( \frac{s}{2} \) meters each.

The total length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides of the square and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The length of each straight side is \( s \) meters, and the circumference of each semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times \frac{s}{2} = \frac{\pi s}{2} \) meters. Therefore, the total length of the path is:
\[
2s + 2 \times \frac{\pi s}{2} = 2s + \pi s = (2 + \pi)s
\]
We are given that the total length of the path is 400 meters, so we have:
\[
(2 + \pi)s = 400
\]
Solving for \( s \), we get:
\[
s = \frac{400}{2 + \pi}
\]
To find the area of the square, we need to calculate \( s^2 \):
\[
s^2 = \left( \frac{400}{2 + \pi} \right)^2

"To solve the problem, we need to use the property of the octahedron that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant. This property is a consequence of the fact that the octahedron is a regular polyhedron and the distances from a point to the vertices can be related through the coordinates of the vertices and the point.

Given that the distances from the point \( P \) to five of the vertices of the octahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are on the same face and \( E, F \) are the opposite vertices. The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are \( PA, PB, PC, PD, PE, PF \). We know five of these distances: \( PA = 3 \), \( PB = 7 \), \( PC = 8 \), \( PD = 9 \), and \( PF = 11 \). We need to find \( PE \).

The property of the octahedron states that:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = \text{constant} \]

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is the same. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices is constant to find \( PE \).

Let's calculate the sum of the squares of the known distances:
\[ PA^2 = 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ PB^2 = 7^2 = 49 \]
\[ PC^2 = 8^2 = 64 \]
\[ PD^2 = 9^2 = 81 \]
\[ PF^2 = 11^2 = 121 \]

Adding these together, we get:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PF^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324 \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant, we have:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 324 + PE^2 \]

Therefore, we can find \( PE^2 \) by subtracting the sum of the squares of the known distances from the constant sum:
\[ PE^2 = 324 - 324 = 0 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ PE = \sqrt{0} = 0 \]

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine how many numbers in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\) are the same, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:

- The digit 1 appears in both representations.
- The digit 5 appears in both representations.
- The digit 6 appears in both representations.

Thus, the digits that are the same in both representations are 1, 5, and 6. There are 3 such digits.

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), the degree \( n \) is 4. The coefficient of the \( x^3 \) term in \( f(x) \) is 0, and the leading coefficient is 3. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the other three vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Since the rectangle is symmetric and the problem is the same for each vertex, we can focus on the region closer to \(O\) than to \(A\).

First, let's consider the perpendicular bisector of the line segment \(OA\). This line will divide the rectangle into two regions: one where points are closer to \(O\) and one where points are closer to \(A\). The perpendicular bisector of \(OA\) is a line that passes through the midpoint of \(OA\) and is perpendicular to \(OA\).

Since \(O\) is the center of the rectangle, the coordinates of \(O\) are \((0,0)\) and the coordinates of \(A\) are \((-a, b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are the half-lengths of the sides of the rectangle. The midpoint of \(OA\) is \((-a/2, b/2)\) and the slope of \(OA\) is \(-b/a\). Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular bisector is \(a/b\).

The equation of the perpendicular bisector is:
\[ y - \frac{b}{2} = \frac{a}{b} \left( x + \frac{a}{2} \right) \]
\[ y - \frac{b}{2} = \frac{a}{b} x + \frac{a^2}{2b} \]
\[ y = \frac{a}{b} x + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b} \]

This line will intersect the sides of the rectangle. However, since the rectangle is symmetric and the problem is the same for each vertex, the region closer to \(O\) than to any other vertex will be a smaller rectangle with the same center \(O\) and sides parallel to the original rectangle but scaled down by a factor of \(1/2\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is \((1/2)^2 = 1/4\) of the area of the original rectangle. Since the problem is the same for each vertex, the region closer to \(O\) than to any other vertex is one of the four regions, each of which has an area of \(1/4\) of the area of the original rectangle.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any other vertex is:

Next, we use the quotient to find the remainder \(r\) by multiplying the quotient by 6 and subtracting the result from 54:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:

"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal.

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3 + n+2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n-9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, let's solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the other equation \( 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \):
\[
2(7) + 1 = 4(7) - 13 \implies 14 + 1 = 28 - 13 \implies 15 = 15

These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, we combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the identity \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute to get:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the minimum distance traveled when starting from one point and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the concept of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

However, in this problem, we are not required to return to the starting point, so we are dealing with a variant of the TSP known as the Hamiltonian path problem. The Hamiltonian path problem is to find the shortest path that visits each point exactly once.

The minimum distance traveled will be the length of the shortest Hamiltonian path in the graph formed by the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The length of the shortest Hamiltonian path is the sum of the lengths of the three shortest edges in the graph.

To find the minimum distance, we need to know the distances between each pair of points. Let's denote the distances as follows:
- \(d_{AB}\) is the distance between points \(A\) and \(B\),
- \(d_{AC}\) is the distance between points \(A\) and \(C\),
