"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   Simplifying each term separately, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = 1 + i,
   \]
   and
   \[
   (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2})i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2})i^2 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2})i - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2}) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2}) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2})i = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i = 3 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2} \right)i = 3 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i.

   Adding these two results together, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \left( 1 + 3 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)i = \left( 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)i.

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = \left( 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)i + (2 - 3i) = \left( 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 2 \right) + \left( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \right)i = \left( 6 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( -2 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)i.

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Combining these results, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

4. Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization. We know that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each factor modulo 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder of 4 when divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.

Next, find the remainder of 6 when divided by 7:
\[

"To determine the minimal number of degrees a regular hexagon needs to be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the properties of rotational symmetry of a regular hexagon.

A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. When a regular hexagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after every rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by one of its sides at the center. This angle is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Angle per side} = \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
\]

This means that the hexagon will look the same after being rotated by 60 degrees, 120 degrees, 180 degrees, 240 degrees, 300 degrees, and 360 degrees. The smallest positive angle that will return the hexagon to its original position is 60 degrees.

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the diagonals bisect each other, these midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. If we assume \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(B\), then the midpoint of \(BD\) is the same as the midpoint of \(AC\), but we need to check the other possible configuration.

Let's assume \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(A\), then the midpoint of \(AD\) is the same as the midpoint of \(BC\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\), this solution is valid. The value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)

   So, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   Let \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[ 10T = 3S + (S - 2T) \]

Combine like terms on the right side of the equation:

\[ 10T = 4S - 2T \]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):

\[ 12T = 4S \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 3T \]

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the water in the tank. Since the tank is being filled at a constant rate, the rate of change of the volume \(V\) with respect to time \(t\) is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

Similarly, the rate of change of the height \(h\) with respect to time \(t\) is:

\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

We can use the chain rule to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height. Differentiating the volume formula with respect to time, we get:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we have:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To solve for \(r^2\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\):

\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of the function \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both cases: \( x \geq a \) and \( x < a \).

1. **Case 1: \( x \geq a \)**

   The function is given by:
   \[
   f(x) = ax^2
   \]
   For \( x \geq a \), the function \( f(x) \) is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).

   - If \( a > 0 \):
     - The minimum value occurs at \( x = a \):
       \[
       f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3
       \]
     - As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \).

   - If \( a < 0 \):
     - The maximum value occurs at \( x = a \):
       \[
       f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3
       \]
     - As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to -\infty \).

2. **Case 2: \( x < a \)**

   The function is given by:
   \[
   f(x) = ax + 2a
   \]
   This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \).

   - If \( a > 0 \):
     - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \to -\infty \).
     - As \( x \to a \), \( f(x) \to a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a \).

   - If \( a < 0 \):
     - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \).
     - As \( x \to a \), \( f(x) \to a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a \).

3. **Combining Both Cases**

   We need to ensure that the function \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once. This means that the range of \( f(x) \) must cover all real numbers.

   - For \( a > 0 \):
     - The range of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) is \([a^3, \infty)\).
     - The range of \( f(x) \) for \( x < a \) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).
     - The combined range is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \cup [a^3, \infty)\).
     - For the range to cover all real numbers, we need:
       \[
       a^2 + 2a \geq a^3
       \]
       Rearranging gives:
       \[
       a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0

       \[
       a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0

       Factoring the quadratic:
       \[
       a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0
       \]
       The roots are \( a = 0, 2, -1 \). Testing intervals:
       - For \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) (True)
       - For \( a \in (-1, 0) \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) > 0 \) (False)
       - For \( a \in (0, 2) \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) < 0 \) (True)
       - For \( a \in [2, \infty) \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0 \) (True)

   - For \( a < 0 \):
     - The range of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) is \([a^3, \infty)\).
     - The range of \( f(x) \) for \( x < a \) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).
     - The combined range is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \cup [a^3, \infty)\).
     - For the range to cover all real numbers, we need:
       \[
       a^2 + 2a \geq a^3
       \]
       This is the same inequality as before, and the analysis is the same.

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda > 1\)).

Next, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\), so \(y\) is a fixed point of \(f\). Therefore, \(y\) must be either 0 or \(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda > 1\)).

We will consider two cases:

**Case 1: \(y = 0\)**

If \(y = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\). This gives:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = 0 \implies x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1.
\]
For \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), we have \(f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0\) or \(f(f(x)) = f(1) = 0\), respectively. However, \(f(x) = x\) in both cases, so this does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\).

**Case 2: \(y = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda > 1\))**

If \(y = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), then \(f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\). This gives:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda^2 x(1 - x) = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
The solutions to this quadratic equation are:
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \sqrt{\lambda^4 - 4\lambda^2(\lambda - 1)}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \sqrt{\lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{\lambda} + \frac{4}{\lambda^2}}}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda^2 \left|1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right|}{2\lambda^2}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \left|1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right|}{2}.
\]
We need to check which of these solutions satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\).

If \(\lambda > 2\), then \(\left|1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right| = 1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\), so the solutions are:
\[
x = \frac{1 + 1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}}{2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{1 - 1 + \frac{2}{\lambda}}{2} = \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we have \(f(x) = 0 \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) and \(f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0 \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), so this does not satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\).

For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we have \(f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{1}{\lambda}\) and \(f(f(x)) = f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), so this satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\).

If \(1 < \lambda \le 2\), then \(\left|1 - \frac{2}{\lambda}\right| = \frac{2}{\lambda} - 1\), so the solutions are:
\[
x = \frac{1 + \frac{2}{\lambda} - 1}{2} = \frac{1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{1 - \frac{2}{\lambda} + 1}{2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we have \(f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{1}{\lambda}\) and \(f(f(x)) = f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), so this satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\).

For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we have \(f(x) = 0 \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) and \(f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0 \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\), so this does not satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are \(\lambda > 1\).

"To find the measure of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta\) is given by the expression

\[

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan (A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
This matches the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 35^\circ\):
\[
\tan 35^\circ = \frac{\tan 65^\circ + \tan 5^\circ}{1 - \tan 65^\circ \tan 5^\circ}.

- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

\[

\[

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, it can be shown that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} \).

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}. \]

Therefore, the answer is:

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and using properties of medians and similar triangles.

1. **Identify the properties of the medians and the centroid:**
   - The medians \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \) of triangle \( ABC \) intersect at the centroid \( G \).
   - The centroid \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

2. **Determine the relationship between triangles \( ABC \) and \( AMN \):**
   - The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \).
   - Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

3. **Find the ratio of the sides of triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \):**
   - The centroid \( G \) divides the median \( BE \) in the ratio 2:1, so \( AG:GD = 2:1 \).
   - Since \( MN \parallel BC \) and \( G \) is the midpoint of \( AD \) in terms of the ratio, \( AM:MB = AG:GD = 2:1 \).
   - Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides of triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) is \( 2:3 \).

4. **Calculate the area of triangle \( AMN \):**
   - The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.
   - Thus, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).
   - The area of triangle \( AMN \) is \( \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64 \).

5. **Determine the area of triangle \( ENG \):**
   - Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( ENG \) and \( EBC \) are similar.
   - The ratio of the corresponding sides of triangles \( ENG \) and \( EBC \) is the same as the ratio of the segments into which \( G \) divides \( BE \), which is \( 1:3 \).
   - Therefore, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is \( \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( EBC \).

6. **Calculate the area of triangle \( EBC \):**
   - Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides the median \( BE \) in the ratio 2:1, so the area of triangle \( EBC \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).
   - The area of triangle \( EBC \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48 \).

7. **Calculate the area of triangle \( ENG \):**
   - The area of triangle \( ENG \) is \( \frac{1}{9} \times 48 = \frac{48}{9} = 16 \).

Thus, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",8,"[8, '8']",False

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula again:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of these two numbers that are two-digit integers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are \(2\) and \(5\). Therefore, the common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of the product of the lowest powers of these common prime factors, which is:

This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \). Therefore, we need to find the number of divisors of \( 24 \) that are greater than \( 1 \).

"To determine how many five-cent coins Hillary has, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of ten-cent coins.
- Let \( p \) be the number of five-cent coins.

According to the problem, Hillary has a total of 11 coins, and the total value of these coins is 75 cents. We can express these conditions with the following equations:

1. \( d + p = 11 \) (the total number of coins)
2. \( 10d + 5p = 75 \) (the total value of the coins, where each ten-cent coin is worth 10 cents and each five-cent coin is worth 5 cents)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ 2d + p = 15 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( d + p = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + p = 15 \)

To eliminate \( p \), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (2d + p) - (d + p) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2d + p - d - p = 4 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( p \):

\[ 4 + p = 11 \]
\[ p = 11 - 4 \]
\[ p = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of five-cent coins Hillary has is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we first need to identify the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to understand the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In the set of the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the rest are odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Now, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number from the set of the first six prime numbers. Since each person has 6 choices, the total number of outcomes is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36. \]

Next, we need to count the number of outcomes where the sum of the chosen numbers is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse choose even numbers.
2. Both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers.

Since there is only one even number in the set, the number of outcomes where both Paul and Jesse choose even numbers is:

The number of outcomes where both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers is:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25. \]

Therefore, the total number of outcomes where the sum of the chosen numbers is even is:
\[ 1 + 25 = 26. \]

Finally, the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

   There are two right triangles in the shaded region. Both triangles have their right angles at the bottom left corner of the grid, and their hypotenuses are along the diagonal from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the grid.
   - The first triangle has a base of 1 unit and a height of 4 units.

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0 and 1, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. We have:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2. \]
A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Since the number must end in 0 (to be divisible by 2 and 25), it must end in 00. Additionally, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 (to be divisible by 9).

We will now construct the smallest number composed of the digits 0 and 1 that meets these criteria. The number must end in 00, and the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9.

To confirm, we check the divisibility:
- The number 11111111100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2 and 25.
- The sum of the digits is 9, so it is divisible by 9.

"To determine the probability that the figure is placed on a shaded square of the chessboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for the first and second numbers:**
   - The first number can be any of the 8 numbers on the kotač, and it will determine the column on the chessboard. Since the kotač is divided into 4 equal parts, each part corresponds to one of the 4 columns (1, 2, 3, 4).
   - The second number can be any of the 12 numbers on the kotač, and it will determine the row on the chessboard. Since the kotač is divided into 5 equal parts, each part corresponds to one of the 5 rows (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - There are 4 possible columns and 5 possible rows, so the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

3. **Identify the shaded squares on the chessboard:**
   - A standard chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, making a total of 64 squares.
   - The shaded squares are the ones where the sum of the row and column numbers is odd. This is because a square is shaded if it is either black or white, and the pattern alternates such that adjacent squares are different colors.

4. **Determine the number of shaded squares in the 4x5 grid:**
   - We need to count the number of pairs \((\text{column}, \text{row})\) such that the sum of the column and row numbers is odd.
   - If the column number is odd (1 or 3), the row number must be even (2 or 4) to make the sum odd.
   - If the column number is even (2 or 4), the row number must be odd (1 or 3) to make the sum odd.

\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,

\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). We can use this identity to find the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Let \(x = 20^\circ\), then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Therefore, the original expression is:

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these identities back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]

Combine the constant terms:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\). However, a known result in trigonometry states that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9.
\]

Therefore, substitute this result back into the expression:
\[
3 + 9 = 12.

Thus, the value of the expression is:

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < x < 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Find the possible values for \(n\):**
   We need to find \(n\) such that the equation \((n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x\) holds true for some \(x\) in the range \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\). First, let's find the value of \(n\) if \(x\) were at its minimum value, which is slightly greater than \(0^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   n \approx 7
   \]
   Now, let's check if \(n = 7\) works by finding the exact value of \(x\):
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   900^\circ = 1070^\circ + x \implies x = 900^\circ - 1070^\circ = -170^\circ
   \]
   Since \(x = -170^\circ\) is not in the range \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\), \(n = 7\) is not a valid solution.

   Next, let's check \(n = 8\):
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   1080^\circ = 1070^\circ + x \implies x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(x = 10^\circ\) is in the range \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\), \(n = 8\) is a valid solution.

Thus, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the congruence:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) (which is even) and keep \( t = 17 \) (which is odd).

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, there are \(12^3 = 1728\) cubic inches in a cubic foot. Therefore, the volume of the cube is 1728 cubic inches.

2. **Determine the length of one side of the cube:**
   Let the length of one side of the cube be \(s\). The volume of a cube is given by \(s^3\). So, we have:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes

\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we compute \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we compute the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

   The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
   The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}\). Applying this property, we get

\[

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is the same as the length of \(\overline{CD}\)) as \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:

This simplifies to:
\[

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{CD}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\overline{AD}\) is the base. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[

\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h.

The total area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):

Since we already know that \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we can substitute this into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h.
\]

To find \(a \times h\), we use the fact that the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles and the total area is 42. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are proportional to their bases \(b\) and \(a\).

[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{84}{2} = 21.

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[

4. **Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by \(-19\):**

   Substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\), we get:

"To find the value of the operation \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we use the definition of the operation @, which is given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

We can simplify this by canceling the \(10\) in the denominator with the \(70\) in the numerator:

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 7 \times 7 = 49

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",49,"[49, '49']",True
"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   Since the points are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, the order in which we choose them matters. However, for the purpose of determining the probability of intersection, we only need to consider the relative order of the points.

2. **Determine the condition for intersection:**
   The segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

3. **Calculate the number of favorable arrangements:**
   There are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the four points. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) permutations. Out of these 6 permutations, only 2 will result in an alternating pattern (the two mentioned above). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Since we fixed one point, we only consider the relative arrangements of the other three points, which gives us:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

However, we need to consider that the points are chosen randomly and independently, and the order in which we choose them matters. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the total number of ways to choose 4 points out of 4, which is \(4!\) (24), and the number of favorable arrangements, which is 2. The correct probability is:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Thus, the correct answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. The larger circle has a radius of 2, and the smaller circle has a radius of 1, both centered at point \(D\).

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

Next, we know that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of a sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
\]

The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these two sectors:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = 2\theta + \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{5}{2}\theta
\]

We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{5}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To find \(\theta\), we solve for \(\theta\):
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

To convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees, we use the fact that \(\pi\) radians is equal to 180 degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180}{3} = 120

Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical cups are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical cup and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical cup. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical cup, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical cups are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical cup:
\[ \text{Number of cups} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical cups needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]
Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\). Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Substituting these values into the angle addition formula, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]

Next, we use the angle subtraction formula for sine:
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]
Substituting the values we found, we get:
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]
This is a difference of squares, so we have:
\[
(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2\sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

Therefore,
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{9}{100} = 0.09.

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply the speed in feet per minute by 12.
2. Convert minutes to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide the speed in inches per minute by 60.

Let's start with the given speed of the bicycle, which is 20 feet per minute.

Step 1: Convert feet to inches.

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a senatski odbor consisting of 8 republicans and 6 democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members without any restrictions.**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 + 6) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all republicans.**
   The number of ways to choose 5 republicans from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all democrats.**
   The number of ways to choose 5 democrats from 6 is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):

   This is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all democrats:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[

Solving the first equation:

Solving the second equation:

\[

"To find the perimeter of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\), \(AM = 11\), and a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we start by letting \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude, we have \(BM = MC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Then, the length of \(BC\) is \(2x\).

Using the right triangle \(ABM\), we can express \(AB\) in terms of \(x\) and \(\theta\):
\[
AB = \frac{BM}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{x}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) with \(AD = 10\) and \(DM = 1\). We need to use the angle condition \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). By the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent function and the angle sum identities. Consider the tangent of \(\angle BDC\) and \(\angle BAC\):
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}.
\]

Using the tangent of the angles in \(\triangle BDM\) and \(\triangle CDM\), we get:
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x,
\]
\[
\tan \angle CDM = \frac{CM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x.
\]

Since \(\angle BDC = \angle BDM + \angle CDM\), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \tan (2\angle BDM) = \frac{2\tan \angle BDM}{1 - \tan^2 \angle BDM} = \frac{2x}{1 - x^2}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\tan \angle BDC\), we get:
\[
\frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta} = \frac{2x}{1 - x^2}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sides of the triangle can be found using the given conditions. Since \(AD = 10\) and \(AM = 11\), we have \(DM = 1\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 = x^2 + 1^2 = x^2 + 1.
\]

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\), we can find the relationship between the sides and angles. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sides of the triangle can be found using the given conditions. The perimeter of the triangle is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} + 2x.
\]

Using the fact that \(x = 11 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\), we get:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2 \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} + 2 \cdot 11 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 22 \left(\frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} + \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right).
\]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. Given that the sum is \(3^7\), we first calculate \(3^7\):

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

The sum of 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as the product of the number of integers and their average. Let the first integer be \(x\). Then the 27 consecutive integers are \(x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26\). The sum of these integers is:

\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + \cdots + (x+26)
\]

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(x\), the last term \(x+26\), and 27 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (x + (x+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2x + 26) = 27 \times (x + 13)
\]

We know that this sum is equal to \(2187\), so we set up the equation:

\[
27 \times (x + 13) = 2187
\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 27:

\[
x + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:

\[
x = 68
\]

The 27 consecutive integers are therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. Counting to the 14th term, we have:

\[

The 14th term is \(81\). Therefore, the median of these 27 consecutive integers is:

"To determine the real values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Since \( (x^2 + 2)^2 \) is a square, it is always non-negative, and the left part of the inequality \( 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 \) is always true for all real \( x \) except when \( x^2 + 2 = 0 \). However, \( x^2 + 2 = 0 \) has no real solutions because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \). Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:
\[ (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we get:
\[ -5 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we obtain:
\[ -7 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the left part of the inequality \( -7 < x^2 \) is always true. Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:
\[ x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]
Thus, the real values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) are:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and properties of symmetric polynomials.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given that \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we can solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearrange to get
\[-8 + 36 = \frac{1728}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[28 = \frac{1728}{p^3}.\]
Solving for \(p^3\), we get
\[p^3 = \frac{1728}{28} = \frac{432}{7}.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

However, we need to check if this value is consistent with the original equations. Instead, we can use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try to find a simpler solution. By trial and error or further algebraic manipulation, we find that \(x = y = z = \sqrt[3]{4}\) satisfies all the equations. Therefore, \(xy + yz + zx = 3(\sqrt[3]{4})^2 = 3 \cdot 2 = 6\).

Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine for which razred the number of muških korisnika autobusa je najbliži \(135\%\) broja ženskih korisnika mobilnog telefona, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of muških korisnika i broj ženskih korisnika u svakom razredu.
2. Calculate \(135\%\) of the broj ženskih korisnika u svakom razredu.
3. Find the razred u kome je broj muških korisnika najbliži \(135\%\) broja ženskih korisnika.

Let's start with the calculations:

### Razred \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\)
- Broj muških korisnika: \(41.1\% \times 600 = 246.6 \approx 247\)
- Broj ženskih korisnika: \(39.4\% \times 600 = 236.4 \approx 236\)
- \(135\%\) of broj ženskih korisnika: \(135\% \times 236 = 0.135 \times 236 = 318.6 \approx 319\)

### Razred \(10^{\mathrm{th}}\)
- Broj muških korisnika: \(34.4\% \times 600 = 206.4 \approx 206\)
- Broj ženskih korisnika: \(33.1\% \times 600 = 198.6 \approx 199\)
- \(135\%\) of broj ženskih korisnika: \(135\% \times 199 = 0.135 \times 199 = 268.65 \approx 269\)

### Razred \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\)
- Broj muških korisnika: \(20.6\% \times 600 = 123.6 \approx 124\)
- Broj ženskih korisnika: \(13.8\% \times 600 = 82.8 \approx 83\)
- \(135\%\) of broj ženskih korisnika: \(135\% \times 83 = 0.135 \times 83 = 112.05 \approx 112\)

### Razred \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\)
- Broj muških korisnika: \(11.6\% \times 600 = 69.6 \approx 70\)
- Broj ženskih korisnika: \(8.6\% \times 600 = 51.6 \approx 52\)
- \(135\%\) of broj ženskih korisnika: \(135\% \times 52 = 0.135 \times 52 = 70.2 \approx 70\)

Now, we compare the number of muških korisnika u svakom razredu s \(135\%\) broja ženskih korisnika:
- Razred \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\): \(247\) vs \(319\) (difference: \(319 - 247 = 72\))
- Razred \(10^{\mathrm{th}}\): \(206\) vs \(269\) (difference: \(269 - 206 = 63\))
- Razred \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\): \(124\) vs \(112\) (difference: \(124 - 112 = 12\))
- Razred \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\): \(70\) vs \(70\) (difference: \(70 - 70 = 0\))

The smallest difference is \(0\), which occurs in the \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\) razred. Therefore, the number of muških korisnika mobilnog telefona u \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\) razredu je najbliži \(135\%\) broja ženskih korisnika mobilnog telefona.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the dimensions of the field. Let the length of the field be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters. The steeple consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles at the ends of the rectangle. The radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{W}{2} \) meters.

The total length of the steeple is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \times \frac{W}{2} \), so the circumferences of two semicircles is \( 2 \times \pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \pi W \). Therefore, the total length of the steeple is:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0

Solving for \( W \):
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}

We substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):

The area \( A \) is then:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2.

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \( y \) into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \( D \), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \( x \):

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us three critical points: \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we have \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To find the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by considering the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given that the distances from point \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center.

However, for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is also equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the pairs of opposite vertices. Therefore, we can write:
\[
d(P, A)^2 + d(P, F)^2 = d(P, B)^2 + d(P, E)^2 = d(P, C)^2 + d(P, D)^2
\]

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex as \( x \). Without loss of generality, assume \( d(P, A) = 3 \), \( d(P, B) = 7 \), \( d(P, C) = 8 \), \( d(P, D) = 9 \), and \( d(P, E) = 11 \). Then, the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) must be such that:
\[
3^2 + x^2 = 7^2 + 11^2 = 8^2 + 9^2
\]

First, we calculate the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
7^2 + 11^2 = 49 + 121 = 170
\]
\[
8^2 + 9^2 = 64 + 81 = 145
\]

Since \( 3^2 + x^2 \) must equal one of these values, and it must be equal to 170 (because 145 is not equal to \( 3^2 + x^2 \) for any real \( x \)), we have:
\[
3^2 + x^2 = 170
\]
\[
9 + x^2 = 170
\]
\[
x^2 = 161
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{161}
\]

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is \(\boxed{\sqrt{161}}\).","[sqrt(161), '\\sqrt{161}']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"To find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball, we start with the formula for force, which is given by:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen and Jack are applying the same force, we can set their forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{Jen}} = F_{\text{Jack}} \]

This means:

\[ m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \]

We know the masses of the softball and the baseball:

- Mass of the softball, \( m_{\text{Jen}} = 200 \) g
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \) g

We can rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio of the accelerations:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{m_{\text{Jack}}}{m_{\text{Jen}}} \]

Substituting the masses:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

Now, we simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Thus, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball is:

"To determine how many digits are common between the representations of the number \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the two representations
The representation of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 is \(1556_7\) and in base 8 is \(1165_8\). We need to find the common digits between these two numbers.

\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \]

There are no handshakes between the vještice or between the čarobnjaka, so the total number of handshakes that occurred at the gathering is simply the number of handshakes between the vještice and the čarobnjaka.

Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0 = 2.

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can express \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product, we get:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^3\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1^3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^3\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^3\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_2^3\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2^3\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^3 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^3 + \alpha_3^3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^3.
\]

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the roots of the polynomial can be written in a specific form. The roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) are:
\[
\alpha_1 = -1 + i, \quad \alpha_2 = -1 - i, \quad \alpha_3 = 1 + i, \quad \alpha_4 = 1 - i.
\]

Now, we can calculate the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\):
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = (-1 + i)(-1 - i) + (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4,

\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = (-1 + i)(1 + i) + (-1 - i)(1 - i) = -1 - 1 + i - i - 1 - 1 - i + i = -4,

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The coordinates of the vertices can be expressed as follows:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the half-lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) respectively, and \(k = \frac{a}{b}\).

The point \(O\) is the midpoint of both diagonals and has coordinates \((0, 0)\).

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any vertex. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is:
\[

\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

For \(P\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

Squaring both sides, we get:

\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2

\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:

- For \(C\): \(-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For \(D\): \(-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
2. Identify the quotient and the remainder.

First, let's do the division:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

The quotient is 9. Now, to find the remainder, we can use the relationship between the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder, which is given by:

\[ \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder} \]

In this case, the dividend is 54, the divisor is 6, and the quotient is 9. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 54 = (6 \times 9) + \text{Remainder} \]

Calculating the product of 6 and 9:

\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 54 = 54 + \text{Remainder} \]

To find the remainder, we subtract 54 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Remainder} = 54 - 54 = 0 \]

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, was left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie converted their coins into dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money each person earned in dollars.
2. Sum the total amounts earned by all four individuals.
3. Convert the total amount from dollars to cents.
4. Determine the amount of money left after converting the coins into dollars.

First, let's convert each person's earnings into cents:
- Linda earned \$27.47. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we have:
  \[
  27.47 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 2747 \text{ cents}
  \]
- Sherry earned \$35.23. Converting this to cents, we get:
  \[
  35.23 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 3523 \text{ cents}
  \]
- June earned \$37.37. Converting this to cents, we get:
  \[
  37.37 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 3737 \text{ cents}
  \]
- Connie earned \$26.52. Converting this to cents, we get:
  \[
  26.52 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 2652 \text{ cents}
  \]

Next, we sum the total amounts earned by all four individuals in cents:
\[
2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
2747 + 3523 = 6270
\]
\[
6270 + 3737 = 9907
\]
\[
9907 + 2652 = 12559
\]

The total amount of money earned by all four individuals is 12559 cents. Since they converted all their coins into dollars, the amount of money left after the conversion is the remainder when 12559 is divided by 100. This is because 100 cents make a dollar, and any amount less than 100 cents is the remainder.

To find the remainder, we perform the division:
\[
12559 \div 100 = 125 \text{ remainder } 59
\]

The remainder is 59, which means the amount of money left after converting the coins into dollars is 59 cents.

Thus, the amount of money left is \(\boxed{59}\) cents.","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the class on the test, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students in the class.

First, let's calculate the total score of the students:
- 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for these students is:
  \[
  20 \times 80 = 1600
  \]
- 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for these students is:
  \[
  8 \times 90 = 720
  \]
- 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for these students is:
  \[
  2 \times 100 = 200
  \]

Now, we add up all these total scores to get the overall total score of the class:
\[
1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
\]

Next, we divide the overall total score by the number of students in the class to find the average score:
\[
\text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84

Therefore, the average score of the class on the test is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the columns and the diagonals:

The magic square becomes:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Let's check the sum of the first column:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the second column:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the third column:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the main diagonal:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the other diagonal:
\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

"To determine how many steps Jim saves compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim hods diagonally across the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ steps}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha hods along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:
\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ steps}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ steps}
\]

Therefore, Jim saves \(\boxed{200}\) steps compared to Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To find the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Next, we need to find the value of the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). Expanding this product, we get:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
So the denominator is 1, and the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
