"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\).

Given:
\[
\sin D = 0.7 = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]
we know that \(EF = 7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}i}{2} + \frac{6\sqrt{2}i^2}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots to simplify the expression.

Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 242.
- Start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
  \[
  242 \div 2 = 121
  \]
  So, 242 can be written as \(2 \times 121\).
- Next, find the prime factorization of 121. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. Check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check the next prime number, which is 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check the next prime number, which is 7. Perform the division:
  \[
  121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]
  So, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check the next prime number, which is 11. Perform the division:
  \[
  121 \div 11 = 11
  \]
  So, 121 can be written as \(11 \times 11\).
- Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
  \[
  242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
  \]

Step 2: Use the prime factorization to simplify the square root.
- The square root of a product is the product of the square roots:
  \[
  \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that 3 specific people (Pierre, Raza, and Thomas) sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Raza, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"".** This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

2. **Arrange Pierre, Raza, and Thomas within their block.** There are 3 people in the block, and they can be arranged among themselves in \(3! = 6\) ways.

3. **Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Raza, and Thomas within their block.** This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Raza, and Thomas sit next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). First, we simplify the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
5k = 15 \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

Putting it all together:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center in a counterclockwise direction to match its initial position, we need to understand the properties of rotational symmetry of a regular pentagon.

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides of the pentagon. This is because the pentagon has five-fold rotational symmetry.

The formula to find the angle of rotation for a regular polygon with \( n \) sides is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{n}
\]
For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \). Therefore, the angle of rotation is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]
This means that the pentagon will look the same after being rotated by 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and 360 degrees. The smallest positive angle of rotation that will make the pentagon match its initial position is 72 degrees.

Thus, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the value of \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) where \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute this into the tangent formula:

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can simplify the expression by canceling \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in your head, we can use a clever algebraic manipulation. Let's start by rewriting the expression in a form that is easier to handle.

First, consider the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\). Notice that this expression is very close to the expansion of \((99+1)^2\). Let's expand \((99+1)^2\):

\[
(99+1)^2 = 99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 99^2 + 198 + 1

Now, compare this with the original expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\). We can see that:

\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = (99+1)^2 - 99

Next, we know that \(99+1 = 100\), so \((99+1)^2 = 100^2 = 10000\). Substituting this back into the equation, we get:

\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = 10000 - 99

Finally, we perform the subtraction:

\[

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[

\[

\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):

\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the weight of the tricycle in terms of the weight of the e-skateboard.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one tricycle.
- Let \( E \) be the weight of one e-skateboard.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one golf ball.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ten tricycles weigh the same as three e-skateboards and one golf ball:
   \[
   10T = 3E + G
   \]
2. Two tricycles and one golf ball weigh the same as one e-skateboard:
   \[
   2T + G = E

We need to eliminate \( G \) from these equations. First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = E - 2T
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3E + (E - 2T)
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
10T = 4E - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides:
\[
12T = 4E
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[

So, the weight of one e-skateboard is 3 times the weight of one tricycle. To find out how many tricycles weigh the same as one e-skateboard, we see that:

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form should match the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
We distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We know this must be equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):
\[
12t^4: \quad 12 = 12
\]
\[
t^3: \quad 3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
t^2: \quad -6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
t: \quad -10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
\text{constant term:} \quad -2a = 6
\]
From the constant term equation, we solve for \(a\):
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]
Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for the \(t\) term:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]
Now we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the equation for the \(t^3\) term to verify:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26

Finally, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the equation for the \(t^2\) term to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
All the equations are satisfied, so the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the water in the tank. Since the tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, the rate of change of the volume with respect to time, \(\frac{dV}{dt}\), is \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour. Similarly, the rate of change of the height with respect to time, \(\frac{dh}{dt}\), is 4 meters per hour. We can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time to relate these rates:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \(4\pi\):

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) defined piecewise:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first piece \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x \geq a \).
2. **Behavior**: As \( x \) increases from \( a \) to \( \infty \), \( ax^2 \) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of this piece is \( [a^3, \infty) \).

### Step 2: Analyze the second piece \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x < a \).
2. **Behavior**: As \( x \) decreases from \( a \) to \( -\infty \), \( ax + 2a \) decreases without bound. Therefore, the range of this piece is \( (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \).

### Step 3: Determine the overall range of \( f(x) \)

The overall range of \( f(x) \) is the union of the ranges of the two pieces:

\[
\text{Range of } f(x) = (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \cup [a^3, \infty).
\]

### Step 4: Ensure every horizontal line intersects the graph at least once

For every horizontal line \( y = k \) to intersect the graph of \( f(x) \) at least once, the range of \( f(x) \) must cover all real numbers. This means that there should be no gaps in the range.

### Step 5: Find the condition for no gaps

To ensure there are no gaps, we need to check the point where the two pieces meet, which is at \( x = a \):

- For \( x = a \), the value of the first piece is \( f(a) = a^3 \).
- The value of the second piece as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left is \( a^2 + 2a \).

For there to be no gap, we need:

\[
a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.
\]

### Step 6: Solve the inequality

Rearranging the inequality gives:

\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.
\]

Factoring out \( a \):

\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.
\]

Factoring the quadratic:

\[
a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.
\]

### Step 7: Determine the intervals

The roots of the equation \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0 \) are \( a = 0, a = 2, \) and \( a = -1 \). We can analyze the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these roots:

- For \( a < -1 \): The expression is negative.
- For \( -1 < a < 0 \): The expression is positive.
- For \( 0 < a < 2 \): The expression is negative.
- For \( a > 2 \): The expression is positive.

### Step 8: Find the largest \( a \)

The inequality \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) holds for \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2] \). The largest value of \( a \) in this range is \( a = 2 \).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius. We know that the radius \(r\) is 1, so we set \(34 - c\) equal to \(1^2\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \(c\), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) for which the circle has a radius of 1 is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\). So, we need to solve the system:
\[
y = \lambda x(1 - x) \quad \text{and} \quad x = \lambda y(1 - y).
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) \implies x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) \implies x(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\)
2. \(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0\).

The first case \(x = 0\) is a fixed point, so we discard it. We need to solve the second equation:
\[
1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, so we discard it. We need to find other solutions. Let's test the boundary values \(x = 1\):
\[
y = f(1) = \lambda \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f(0) = \lambda \cdot 0 \cdot (1 - 0) = 0.
\]
So, \(x = 1\) is not a solution. Now, let's test the values of \(\lambda\) such that the quadratic equation has real solutions. We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is non-negative. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the function \(f(x)\) is symmetric and has a maximum at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The maximum value of \(f(x)\) is:
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution where \(f(x) \neq x\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) must be greater than 1, i.e., \(\frac{\lambda}{4} > 1 \implies \lambda > 4\). However, since \(\lambda\) is in the interval \([0, 4]\), the only possible value is \(\lambda = 4\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is:

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we can further simplify, but a simpler approach is to recognize that this expression matches the tangent of a specific angle. By inspection or using a calculator, we find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the product.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by the powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Let's start with the initial number of books in each category:
- The top shelf has 8 mystery books.
- The middle shelf has 10 mathematics books.
- The bottom shelf has 6 science books.

The total number of books is:
\[ 8 + 10 + 6 = 24 \]

Next, we take 2 books from each shelf:
- From the top shelf, 2 mystery books are taken, leaving \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) mystery books.
- From the middle shelf, 2 mathematics books are taken, leaving \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) mathematics books.
- From the bottom shelf, 2 science books are taken, leaving \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) science books.

The total number of remaining books is:
\[ 6 + 8 + 4 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books. The number of mathematics books remaining is 8, and the total number of remaining books is 18. Therefore, the fraction is:
\[ \frac{8}{18} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ \frac{8 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = \frac{4}{9} \]

Thus, the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books is:

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 units squared and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units, we can substitute these values into the formula.

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula again:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",350,"[350, '350']",True

"To determine how many two-digit positive integers are divisible by both 100 and 150, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 150. A number that is divisible by both 100 and 150 must be divisible by their LCM.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[
\text{LCM}(100, 150) = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 3 \times 25 = 300
\]

So, a number that is divisible by both 100 and 150 must be divisible by 300. Next, we need to find how many two-digit positive integers are divisible by 300. The smallest two-digit number is 10 and the largest two-digit number is 99.

We list the multiples of 300 that fall within this range:
\[
300 \times 0 = 0 \quad (\text{not a two-digit number})

\[

Since 300 is the smallest multiple of 300 and it is a three-digit number, there are no two-digit numbers that are divisible by 300.

"Let's denote the number of dimes as \( d \) and the number of nickels as \( n \). We know the following:

1. The total number of coins is 11:
   \[
   d + n = 11

2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since dimes are worth 10 cents and nickels are worth 5 cents, we can express the total value as:
   \[
   10d + 5n = 75
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 5:
\[
2d + n = 15
\]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
d = 4
\]

Now that we have \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( n \):
\[
4 + n = 11

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jess is even, we first need to identify the six prime numbers they are choosing from. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we classify these prime numbers as either even or odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the rest are odd: 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In this case, since there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13), the only way to get an even sum is if both Paul and Jess choose odd numbers.

The probability that Paul chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability that Jess chooses an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Paul and Jess choose odd numbers is:

The diagram shows a rectangle composed of 12 squares, each with a side length of 1 unit. Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are \(3 \times 4\) units.

The shaded region consists of two right triangles. Let's identify these triangles:

1. The first triangle has its vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The second triangle has its vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

**Area of the first triangle:**
The base of the first triangle is 2 units (from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\)), and the height is 4 units (from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\)).
The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0 or 1. Since we are looking for a number whose digits are all 0 and 1, the last digit must be 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the digits are all 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00.

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,

\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,

\[

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We can use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the formula:

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \), so \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To compute the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these expressions back into the original sum:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]
Combine the constant terms:
\[
= 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\):
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

To find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\tan^2 20^\circ\), and \(\tan^2 40^\circ\), we use the triple angle identity for tangent:
\[
\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}.
\]
For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 10^\circ\), but we don't need to solve it explicitly. Instead, we use known values and properties of tangent to find the sum of the squares of the tangents.

Using known results from trigonometry, we have:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 9.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 9 = 12.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon be \(S\). Since the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), the sum of all the interior angles \(S\) is:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   where \(x\) is the measure of the missing interior angle.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   The sum of the interior angles \(S\) can also be expressed as:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We can estimate \(n\) by first finding the value of \(n\) that makes \(S\) slightly greater than \(1070^\circ\).

3. **Estimate \(n\):**
   Let's find the value of \(n\) such that:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n \approx 7.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we test \(n = 7\) and \(n = 8\).

4. **Check \(n = 7\):**
   If \(n = 7\), then the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   This is less than \(1070^\circ\), so \(n = 7\) is not the correct number of sides.

5. **Check \(n = 8\):**
   If \(n = 8\), then the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   This is greater than \(1070^\circ\), so \(n = 8\) is a possible number of sides. The missing angle \(x\) would be:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(x = 10^\circ\) is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon, \(n = 8\) is the correct number of sides.

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the condition:

\[
(t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging the equation gives:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

We can solve this quadratic congruence by using the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Thus, we have:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find \( \sqrt{8} \mod 23 \). We can simplify \( 8 \) as follows:

\[
8 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

Now, we need to find \( \sqrt{8} \) modulo 23. We can check the squares of integers from 0 to 22 to find a solution:

\[
0^2 \equiv 0, \quad 1^2 \equiv 1, \quad 2^2 \equiv 4, \quad 3^2 \equiv 9, \quad 4^2 \equiv 16, \quad 5^2 \equiv 2, \quad 6^2 \equiv 13, \quad 7^2 \equiv 3, \quad 8^2 \equiv 18, \quad 9^2 \equiv 12, \quad 10^2 \equiv 8, \quad 11^2 \equiv 6, \quad 12^2 \equiv 1, \quad 13^2 \equiv 16, \quad 14^2 \equiv 9, \quad 15^2 \equiv 4, \quad 16^2 \equiv 1, \quad 17^2 \equiv 16, \quad 18^2 \equiv 9, \quad 19^2 \equiv 4, \quad 20^2 \equiv 1, \quad 21^2 \equiv 16, \quad 22^2 \equiv 1
\]

From this, we find that \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \). Thus, \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \pmod{23} \).

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( t \):

1. For the positive case:

\[
t = \frac{-2 + 10}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

2. For the negative case:

\[
t = \frac{-2 - 10}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}
\]

Now we have two potential solutions: \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). We need to check which of these is odd:

- \( 4 \) is even.
- \( 17 \) is odd.

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) that satisfies the conditions is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot in square inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1 \implies s = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

2. **Convert the side length from feet to inches:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the side length in inches is:
   \[
   s = 1 \text{ foot} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   The total surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6s^2
   \]
   Substituting the side length in inches, we get:
   \[
   A = 6 \times (12)^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches}

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{864}\) square inches.","[864, '864']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + \sqrt{b}\) is \(a - \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Calculating the squares, we have:

\[
5^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3
\]

Subtracting these values gives:

\[
25 - 3 = 22
\]

Therefore, the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate is \(\boxed{22}\).","[22, '22']",22,"[22, '22']",True

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Calculate \( g \) of the result from step 2.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we move to the second step. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Next, we proceed to the third step. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]

Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
2 \frac{x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the solutions to the equation are

\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}_1\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}_2\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)|}{|\mathbf{d}_1|}.
\]

First, we identify the direction vectors \(\mathbf{d}_1\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2\), and the position vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\):

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the lines are parallel, \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\). Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
|\mathbf{d}_1| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)|}{|\mathbf{d}_1|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

   - The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-5\) to \(5\).
   - The \(y\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-4\) to \(4\).

2. **Determine the points inside the rectangle:**

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{z}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times (\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{z} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{z}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Now, we substitute the given values for \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezoid \(ABCD\). We know that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar triangles because they share the angle at \(A\) and both have a right angle (at \(C\) and \(D\) respectively). Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides is equal. Specifically, the ratio of the bases \(BC\) and \(AD\) is equal to the ratio of the heights from \(C\) to \(AB\) and from \(C\) to \(AD\), which is the same as the ratio of the segments into which \(C\) divides \(AB\).

However, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid if we consider the height \(h\) and the base \(a\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two line segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form one segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the other segment. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]
   However, a simpler way to think about it is to consider the permutations of the points and then divide by the number of ways to arrange the pairs, which is \(2!\). So, the number of ways to pair the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3

2. **Determine the number of ways the line segments can intersect:**

   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. The larger circle has a radius of 2, and the smaller circle has a radius of 1, both centered at point \(D\).

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of a sector of a circle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta\).

The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}

The area of the shaded region is the difference between these two areas:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = 2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2}
\]

We know that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[
3\theta = \frac{10\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9}
\]

Since \(\theta\) is in radians, we convert it to degrees by multiplying by \(\frac{180}{\pi}\):
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{10 \times 180}{9} = \frac{1800}{9} = 200
\]

However, we are asked for the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\), which is the supplementary angle to \(\theta\):
\[

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical glass, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, the expression becomes \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B

\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

This is a product of two binomials, which can be expanded as:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A

Notice that the terms \(\sin A \cos A \sin B \cos B\) and \(-\cos A \sin A \sin B \cos B\) cancel each other out, so we are left with:
\[
= - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \sin^2 B \cos^2 A
\]

We know that \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\cos^2 A = 1 - \sin^2 A = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84

\[
\cos^2 B = 1 - \sin^2 B = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):

1. **Product of the integers**:
   \[
   x(x+1)(x+2) = 120

2. **Finding the integers**:
   We can try to find integer values for \( x \) that satisfy the equation. We can start by testing values:

   - If \( x = 4 \):
     \[
     4 \times 5 \times 6 = 120 \quad \text{(This works)}

   - If \( x = 5 \):

   This confirms that our integers are correct.

"To find the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers and then use the properties of arithmetic sequences to find the median.

First, let's calculate \(3^7\):
\[
3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187
\]
So, the sum of the 27 consecutive integers is 2187.

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:
\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)
\]
where \(S\) is the sum, \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. For consecutive integers, \(d = 1\). Here, \(n = 27\) and \(S = 2187\), so the formula becomes:
\[
2187 = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26)
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
2187 = \frac{27}{2} \times 2 (a + 13) = 27 (a + 13)
\]
Next, we solve for \(a\):
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68

So, the first term \(a\) is 68. The 27 consecutive integers are:

The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. To find the 14th term, we use the formula for the \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[

For the 14th term, \(k = 14\):

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Since \(-4\) is negative, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Next, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3).\]
So the inequality is:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
To solve this, we determine the critical points where the expression is zero, which are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
  \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
  So the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

- For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
  \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
  So the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

- For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
  \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
  So the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is \(-7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have:
\[-7 < x^2 < 3.\]
Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, the inequality \(-7 < x^2\) is always true. Thus, the solution simplifies to:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting the given value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 4p).
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 4p^3}{p^2},
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12(144 - 4p^3)}{p^3},
\]
\[
-8p^3 = 12(144 - 4p^3),
\]
\[
-8p^3 = 1728 - 48p^3,

\[
40p^3 = 1728,

\[
p^3 = \frac{1728}{40},

   - Number of female students using the bus: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.0404\)

3. **Grade 11:**
   - Number of male students using the bus: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8 \approx 62\)
   - Number of female students using the bus: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.5122\)

4. **Grade 12:**
   - Number of male students using the bus: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8 \approx 35\)
   - Number of female students using the bus: \(300 \times 0.086 = 25.8 \approx 26\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.3462\)

Now, we need to find the grade where the ratio is closest to \(135\% = 1.35\). The ratios we calculated are:

- Grade 10: \(1.0404\)
- Grade 11: \(1.5122\)
- Grade 12: \(1.3462\)

The ratio closest to \(1.35\) is \(1.3462\), which corresponds to Grade 12.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Now, let's determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the largest possible area of the rectangular field enclosed by the track, we need to consider the total length of the track and the relationship between the dimensions of the rectangle and the semicircles.

The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters. Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two semicircles together form a full circle with a diameter equal to the width \( W \) of the rectangle. The circumference of this circle is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = L \times W

Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0

\[
\pi W = 200

We know that \(\sin^2{R} + \cos^2{R} = 1\). Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can substitute this value into the equation to find \(\cos{R}\):

f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

The solutions to this equation are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

In this form, \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we have \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

Thus, the answer is:

"To find the value of \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Therefore, the value is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by analyzing the given distances from \( P \) to the five vertices. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between opposite vertices is the same.

Given distances:
- \( PA = 3 \)
- \( PB = 7 \)
- \( PC = 8 \)
- \( PD = 9 \)
- \( PE = 11 \)

Since the octahedron is regular, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( PF \) must be equal to the distance from \( P \) to the vertex opposite to \( E \). Therefore, \( PF \) must be the same as one of the given distances.

To determine which distance corresponds to \( PF \), we need to consider the symmetry and properties of the regular octahedron. The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are distinct, and the distance to the sixth vertex must be one of the given distances.

Given the distances:
- \( PA = 3 \)
- \( PB = 7 \)
- \( PC = 8 \)
- \( PD = 9 \)
- \( PE = 11 \)

The only distance that is not explicitly given is \( PF \). Since \( P \) is equidistant from the opposite vertices, \( PF \) must be one of the given distances. The most logical choice, considering the symmetry and the distinct distances, is the distance that is not already listed.

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( PF \) is:

"To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force \( F \) acting on an object is equal to the mass \( m \) of the object multiplied by its acceleration \( a \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Given that the force applied to both the softball and the baseball is the same, we can write the following equations for each object:

\[ F = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \]
\[ F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Since the force \( F \) is the same for both objects, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the softball and the baseball as follows:
\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ grams} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ grams} \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, which is \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \). From the equation above, we can solve for \( a_{\text{softball}} \) in terms of \( a_{\text{baseball}} \):

\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{softball}}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{150}{200} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Simplifying the fraction, we have:

\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball is:

"To determine how many digits are common in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We need to find the common digits between these two representations.

The digits in \(1556_7\) are \(1, 5, 6\).
The digits in \(1165_8\) are \(1, 1, 6, 5\).

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\). There are 3 common digits.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we can use a property of polynomials that states the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

\[

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:
\[

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

First, we calculate the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we calculate the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We start by expressing \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so we use a known result for the roots of a quartic polynomial. The product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) for the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\) is given by \(d^2\). In our case, \(d = 2\), so:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2^2 = 4.
\]

Now we know that \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 4\), the polynomial simplifies to:
\[
t^3 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - 4 = 0.
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1\), we use the identity:
\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Expanding and simplifying this expression is also complex, but it can be shown that:
\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = -2.
\]

Thus, the polynomial whose roots are \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) is:
\[
t^3 - 2t - 4 = 0.
\]

We solve this polynomial by trying possible rational roots. Testing \(t = 2\):
\[
2^3 - 2 \cdot 2 - 4 = 8 - 4 - 4 = 0.
\]

So, \(t = 2\) is a root. We can factor \(t^3 - 2t - 4\) as:
\[
t^3 - 2t - 4 = (t - 2)(t^2 + 2t + 2).
\]

The roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 + 2t + 2 = 0\) are:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2i}{2} = -1 \pm i.

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is the midpoint of both \(AB\) and \(CD\), and also the midpoint of both \(AD\) and \(BC\).

These perpendicular bisectors form a smaller rectangle with center \(O\) and side lengths \(\frac{a}{2}\) and \(\frac{b}{2}\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).

"To determine how much money, in cents, was left after converting the smallest possible amount of money to dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money collected by summing the amounts each person received.
2. Convert the total amount to cents.
3. Determine the largest amount of money that can be converted to dollars (i.e., the largest multiple of 100 cents that is less than or equal to the total amount in cents).
4. Subtract the amount converted to dollars from the total amount in cents to find the remaining amount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the total amount of money collected:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52

   Adding these amounts together:

   The largest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to 12659 is 12600. Therefore, the amount converted to dollars is 12600 cents.

4. Subtract the amount converted to dollars from the total amount in cents to find the remaining amount:
   \[
   12659 - 12600 = 59
   \]

So, the amount of money left after converting the smallest possible amount of money to dollars is \(\boxed{59}\) cents.","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide it by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the total score of the students who received 80 points.
   \[
   20 \text{ students} \times 80 \text{ points/student} = 1600 \text{ points}
   \]

2. Determine the total score of the students who received 90 points.
   \[
   8 \text{ students} \times 90 \text{ points/student} = 720 \text{ points}
   \]

3. Determine the total score of the students who received 100 points.
   \[
   2 \text{ students} \times 100 \text{ points/student} = 200 \text{ points}
   \]

4. Add up the total scores from all the students.
   \[
   1600 \text{ points} + 720 \text{ points} + 200 \text{ points} = 2520 \text{ points}
   \]

5. Divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score.
   \[
   \frac{2520 \text{ points}}{30 \text{ students}} = 84 \text{ points}
   \]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to use the property that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. This sum is called the magic constant.

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
8 & 1 & 6 \\
3 & 5 & 7 \\
4 & 9 & 2 \\
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
8 + 3 + 4 = 15
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second column:
\[
1 + 5 + 9 = 15
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third column:
\[
6 + 7 + 2 = 15
\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right):
\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

And the sum of the numbers in the other main diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left):
\[
6 + 5 + 4 = 15
\]

Since the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is 15, the magic constant for this magic square is 15.

The value of \( n \) is the magic constant, which is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine how much shorter the path of Jim is compared to Marta, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim travels diagonally across the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the distance Jim travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Jim travels} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Marta travels. Marta travels along the perimeter of the field, which is the sum of the length and the width, and then repeats this path to reach the same point. Since she travels along the length and the width, the distance she travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Marta travels} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Marta travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Jim travels \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Marta.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To find the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega \neq 1\) and \(\omega^2 \neq 1\), and they satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest path that starts from any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visits the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the minimum total distance for each starting point.

   - Path \(B \to C \to D \to A\): \(BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)
   - Path \(B \to D \to A \to C\): \(BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - Path \(B \to D \to C \to A\): \(BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\)
   The minimum distance starting from \(B\) is \(13\).

   The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is \(13\).

4. **Starting from point \(D\):**
   - Path \(D \to A \to B \to C\): \(DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - Path \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - Path \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
   - Path \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - Path \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\)
   - Path \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
