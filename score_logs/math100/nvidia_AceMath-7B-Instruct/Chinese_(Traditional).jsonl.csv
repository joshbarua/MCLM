"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\theta}
   \]
   For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3i - 3i^2
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3i + 3
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To determine the number of different ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that 3 specific individuals (Pierré, Rose, and Thomas) sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the 3 individuals as a single ""block"" or ""super person"".** This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

2. **Arrange the 3 individuals within their block.** There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange Pierré, Rose, and Thomas within their block.

3. **Multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the individuals within their block.** This gives us \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \).

Thus, the total number of different ways to arrange the 8 people around a circular table such that Pierré, Rose, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100 x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6} = -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100 x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot x^6 \cdot \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is equal to zero, as these values of \( x \) will make the function undefined.

First, we factor the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7
\]
\[
x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
\]
Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by analyzing the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we sum \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for all two-dimensional vectors \( \bold{v} \), the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds, we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to compute the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of one squig.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find how many treeks weigh the same as one squig. To do this, we will eliminate \( G \) from the equations. First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides:
\[
12T = 4S
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
3T = S

\[
S = 3T

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

\[

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this polynomial must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its piecewise definition.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The vertex of this parabola is at \(x = a\), and the value of the function at the vertex is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

- If \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards, and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y \geq a^3\).
- If \(a < 0\), the parabola opens downwards, and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y \leq a^3\).

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). The value of the function at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the line has a positive slope, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y < a^2 + 2a\).
- If \(a < 0\), the line has a negative slope, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(\infty\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y > a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Ensure the function intersects every horizontal line at least once
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) must together cover all real numbers. This means that the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(-\infty\). Therefore, the function intersects every horizontal line at least once.
- If \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). For the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).

Solving the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\):
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0 \]

The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Testing the intervals determined by these roots, we find:
- For \(a < -1\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) < 0\).
- For \(-1 < a < 0\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) > 0\).
- For \(0 < a < 2\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) < 0\).
- For \(a > 2\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) > 0\).

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) is satisfied for \(a \leq -1\) or \(0 \leq a \leq 2\).

The maximum value of \(a\) that satisfies this inequality is \(a = 2\).

Thus, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's start by expressing \(f(f(x))\):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
Let \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:
\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]
Since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(x = \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)}\) into \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\):
\[ y = \lambda \left( \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y}{1 - y} \left( \frac{\lambda (1 - y) - y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y (\lambda - \lambda y - y)}{\lambda (1 - y)^2} = \frac{y (\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y)}{\lambda (1 - y)^2}. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\lambda (1 - y)^2\), we get:
\[ \lambda y (1 - y)^2 = y (\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y). \]
Assuming \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):
\[ \lambda (1 - y)^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y. \]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ \lambda (1 - 2y + y^2) = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda - 2\lambda y + \lambda y^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda y^2 - 2\lambda y + (\lambda + 1)y = 0, \]
\[ y (\lambda y - 2\lambda + \lambda + 1) = 0, \]
\[ y (\lambda y - \lambda + 1) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ y = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]
If \(y = 0\), then \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point. If \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(x = \frac{\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}}{\lambda \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}}{\lambda \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda}} = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), which is also a fixed point. However, we need \(f(x) \neq x\), so \(y \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Therefore, the only way to satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\) is if \(y = 0\), which corresponds to \(x = 0\), but this is a fixed point. This means there are no values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0, 4]\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\).

"To find the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) such that the given equation holds, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\).

The given expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine. Recall that:
\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these identities, we can rewrite the numerator and the denominator as follows:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the sum-to-product identities:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]

Therefore, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose tangent is \(-\sqrt{3}\) and is the smallest positive angle is:
\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word contains repeated letters. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E, where the letter E appears twice and the letter L appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S is 1 each, so \( n_3 = n_4 = n_5 = 1 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{5040}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct permutations of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is \(\boxed{1260}\).","[1260, '1260']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",True
"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the product.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since all higher powers of 5 will result in fractions less than 1, their integer parts will be 0. Therefore, we sum the values:

\[
8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots = 9
\]

Thus, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, it can be shown that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} \).

Thus,

\[ 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}. \]

"To find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

Next, perform the division:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Summing these digits, we get:
\[2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14\]

"To find the minimum possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we find:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (since \(\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\)). Therefore, the minimum possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the condition:

\[ t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This can be expanded and rearranged as follows:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We need to solve this quadratic congruence. First, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have two candidates: \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). However, \( t = 4 \) is even, so the only odd solution is:

\[ t = 17 \]

To verify, we check if \( t + 2 = 19 \) is the modular inverse of \( t = 17 \) modulo 23:

\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \]
\[ 323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, \( t = 17 \) is indeed the solution. Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot in square inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the cube in feet:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1 \implies s = 1 \text{ foot}

2. **Convert the side length from feet to inches:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the side length in inches is:
   \[
   s = 1 \times 12 = 12 \text{ inches}

3. **Calculate the total surface area of the cube in square inches:**
   The total surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6s^2

   Substituting the side length in inches, we get:

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):

Now, we need to evaluate \( g(6) \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by:

where \(\mathbf{r_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{r_2} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we calculate \(\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2}\):

= \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4))
\]

Calculating each component:

1. For \(\mathbf{i}\):
   \[
   (-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18) = 36 - 36 = 0
   \]

2. For \(\mathbf{j}\):
   \[

   \]

3. For \(\mathbf{k}\):
   \[
   (2)(-18) - (-9)(4) = -36 + 36 = 0
   \]

Thus, \(\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\).

Since the cross product is zero, the lines are parallel. Now we calculate the distance \(d\) between the lines:

1. Calculate \(\mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}\):
   \[
   \mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. Since \(\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\), we cannot use the standard formula for distance. Instead, we can find the distance between a point on one line and the other line.

3. The distance \(d\) from a point \(\mathbf{r_1}\) to the line defined by \(\mathbf{r_2} + u\mathbf{d_2}\) is given by:
   \[
   d = \frac{|(\mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}) \cdot \mathbf{d_2}|}{|\mathbf{d_2}|}
   \]

4. Calculate \(|\mathbf{d_2}|\):
   \[
   |\mathbf{d_2}| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-18)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 324 + 16} = \sqrt{356} = 2\sqrt{89}

5. Calculate \((\mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}) \cdot \mathbf{d_2}\):
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = (-8)(4) + (7)(-18) + (5)(-4) = -32 - 126 - 20 = -178

6. Now, calculate the distance:
   \[
   d = \frac{|-178|}{2\sqrt{89}} = \frac{178}{2\sqrt{89}} = \frac{89}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{89}

"To determine the number of integer-coordinate points within the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle**:
   - The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\).
   - The width of the rectangle is from \(-5\) to \(5\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\) units.
   - The height of the rectangle is from \(-4\) to \(4\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\) units.

2. **Calculate the total area of the rectangle**:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 10 \times 8 = 80
   \]

3. **Determine the integer-coordinate points**:
   - The integer coordinates for \(x\) will range from \(-5\) to \(5\), inclusive. This gives us the integers: \(-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\). Thus, there are \(11\) possible integer values for \(x\).
   - The integer coordinates for \(y\) will range from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. This gives us the integers: \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). Thus, there are \(9\) possible integer values for \(y\).

4. **Calculate the total number of integer-coordinate points**:
   - The total number of integer-coordinate points within the rectangle is given by the product of the number of choices for \(x\) and \(y\):
   \[

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 + 6) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all Republicans.**

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x - 2 = 64\)
2. \(x - 2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers and then use the properties of consecutive integers to find the median.

First, let's denote the 27 consecutive integers as follows:
\[a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\]
where \(a\) is the smallest of these integers.

The sum of these 27 consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right)
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. For our sequence, \(n = 27\), \(a = a\), and \(d = 1\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \left(2a + 26\right) = 27 \left(a + 13\right)
\]
We know that the sum of these 27 consecutive integers is \(3^7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
27 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can simplify the equation to:
\[
3^3 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7
\]
Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:
\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]
Solving for \(a\), we find:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The 27 consecutive integers are therefore:
\[68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\]
The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. In the sequence \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\), the 14th term is:
\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, 3)\). Thus, the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, define \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[-4 < y^2 + 4y.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The root of the equation \((y + 2)^2 = 0\) is \(y = -2\). This root divides the real number line into two intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\) and \((-2, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -2)\), choose \(y = -3\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-3 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((- \infty, -2)\).

2. For \(y \in (-2, \infty)\), choose \(y = -1\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-1 + 2)^2 = (1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-2, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) is \((-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, \infty)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, \infty)\). Thus, the solution to \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is:
\[x \in \mathbb{R}.\]

Finally, we find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.\]","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True
"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use the identity for the sum of cubes and some algebraic manipulation.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this expression in terms of symmetric sums:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the equation, we get
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
\[24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p) = s(s^2 - 4p),\]
\[24 = sp.\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right) = \frac{24}{p} \left(\frac{576}{p^2} - 4p\right) = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 4p^3}{p^2} = \frac{24(576 - 4p^3)}{p^3}.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[-8 = \frac{13824 - 96p^3}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[-8p^3 = 13824 - 96p^3,\]
and further simplifies to
\[88p^3 = 13824,\]
so
\[p^3 = \frac{13824}{88} = 156.81818181818182.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = 6.\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \( y \) into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \( D \), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

The solutions to \( f'(x) = 0 \) are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

The minimum distance can be expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

"To determine how many digits are common between the base-7 and base-8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base-7 and base-8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base-7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base-7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base-8

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base-8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base-7 and base-8 representations
The base-7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base-8 representation is \(1165_8\). We list the digits of each representation:

- Digits in \(1556_7\): \(1, 5, 6\)

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[

\]

where the line is in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

We know that the sum of these expressions is equal to the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product of these expressions. We use the identity for the product of sums of products of roots:
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product, we get:
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 = 4\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 = 4(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 4 \cdot 2^2 = 16.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1S_2S_3 = 16\), the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t - 16 = 0\), which simplifies to \(t^3 - 16 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(2, -1 + \sqrt{3}i, -1 - \sqrt{3}i\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Let the lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) be \(2a\) and \(2b\) respectively, so that \(AB/AD = k\) implies \(2a/2b = k\) or \(a/b = k\).

The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if its distance to \(O\) is less than its distance to any vertex. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
or
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
or
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:
- For \(B\): \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For \(C\): \(-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For \(D\): \(-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

These four inequalities define a smaller rectangle centered at the origin with side lengths \(a' = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\) and \(b' = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\).

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = 4ab
\]

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = 4a'b' = 4 \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\right) \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area of smaller rectangle}}{\text{Area of } ABCD} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2}
\]

Since \(a/b = k\), we have \(a = kb\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the expression, we get:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(k^2b^2 + b^2)^2}{4(kb)^2b^2} = \frac{(b^2(k^2 + 1))^2}{4k^2b^4} = \frac{b^4(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2b^4} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

First, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha walks along the length and the width of the rectangular field to reach the same position as Jim. The length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the total distance Martha travels is:
\[
400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}

Next, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim walks diagonally across the field. The distance of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width). So, the distance Jim travels is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

The distances between the points are given as follows:

- \(AB = 6\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will calculate the total distance for each starting point and each permutation of the other three points.

### Starting from Point \(A\)
1. \(A \to B \to C \to D\):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
2. \(A \to B \to D \to C\):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13
   \]
3. \(A \to C \to B \to D\):
   \[
   AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
4. \(A \to C \to D \to B\):
   \[
   AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
   \]
5. \(A \to D \to B \to C\):
   \[
   AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
6. \(A \to D \to C \to B\):
   \[
   AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \(A\) is \(13\).

### Starting from Point \(B\)
1. \(B \to A \to C \to D\):
   \[
   BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16
   \]
2. \(B \to A \to D \to C\):
   \[
   BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
3. \(B \to C \to A \to D\):
   \[
   BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. \(B \to C \to D \to A\):
   \[
   BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]
5. \(B \to D \to A \to C\):
   \[
   BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
6. \(B \to D \to C \to A\):
   \[
   BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \(B\) is \(13\).

### Starting from Point \(C\)
1. \(C \to A \to B \to D\):
   \[
   CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15
   \]
2. \(C \to A \to D \to B\):
   \[
   CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
3. \(C \to B \to A \to D\):
   \[
   CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. \(C \to B \to D \to A\):
   \[
   CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
5. \(C \to D \to A \to B\):
   \[
   CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]
6. \(C \to D \to B \to A\):
   \[
   CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is \(13\).

### Starting from Point \(D\)
1. \(D \to A \to B \to C\):
   \[
   DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
2. \(D \to A \to C \to B\):
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
3. \(D \to B \to A \to C\):
   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]
4. \(D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
5. \(D \to C \to A \to B\):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
   \]
6. \(D \to C \to B \to A\):
   \[
   DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \(D\) is \(14\).

The overall minimum distance is the smallest of all the minimum distances calculated above, which is \(13\).

Thus, the shortest distance that can be traveled is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
