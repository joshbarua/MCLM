"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   Simplifying each term separately, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i = 1 + i,
   \]
   and
   \[
   (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i + \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i^2.
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
   \[
   \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i + \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}(-1) = \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i - \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}.
   \]
   Combining the real and imaginary parts, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \left( 1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right) + \left( 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i = \left( \frac{2 - 3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{2 + 3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i = \left( \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = \left( \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 2 \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} - 3 \right)i = \left( \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2} + 4}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4 - 6}{2} \right)i = \left( \frac{12 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 10}{2} \right)i.
   \]
   Simplifying the fractions, we get:
   \[
   w = \left( 6 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 5 \right)i.
   \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 5 \right)i}\).","[i*(-5 + (3*sqrt(2))/2) - 1*3*sqrt(2)/2 + 6, '6 - \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} + ( \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 5 )i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",False

"1. **Problem Setup**: We need to find the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table, with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together.

2. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a Single Unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

3. **Arrange the Units Around the Table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) distinct objects in a circle is given by \( (n-1)! \). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these units around the table is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

4. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas Within Their Unit**: Within their block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged among themselves in \( 3! \) ways:
   \[
   3! = 6

5. **Combine the Arrangements**: To find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units around the table by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720

6. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Next, we calculate \((10x^3)^2\):

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]

Then, we calculate \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

"To find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
   \]

   So, the solutions are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). This means \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). So,

   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[45 + 8 = 53\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[9 + 8 = 17\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"Let's denote the weight of one tree as \( T \), the weight of one squig as \( S \), and the weight of one glee as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( 10T = 3S + G \)  (10 trees weigh the same as 3 squigs and 1 glee)
2. \( 2T + G = S \)  (2 trees and 1 glee weigh the same as 1 squig)

We need to find how many trees weigh the same as one squig, which means we want to express \( S \) in terms of \( T \).

First, let's rearrange the second equation to express \( G \) in terms of \( T \) and \( S \):

\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:

\[

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\):
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\):
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\):
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
   \]
   This is true.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), which must equal \(6\):
   \[

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in the two intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the interval \(x \geq a\). The function in this interval is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

Next, consider the interval \(x < a\). The function in this interval is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, it must cover all possible \(y\)-values. This means that the function must be surjective, i.e., it must take on all real values.

### Case 1: \(a > 0\)
- For \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards. The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
- For \(x < a\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a straight line with a positive slope. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the function to cover all real values, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the interval \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) in the interval \(x < a\). However, since \(f(x)\) in the interval \(x < a\) can take any value from \(-\infty\) to \(a^2 + 2a\), the minimum value \(a^3\) must be less than or equal to \(a^2 + 2a\).

We solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\):
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\]
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\]
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\]

The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2-2)(-2+1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0\). So, the inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5-2)(-0.5+1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \geq 0\). So, the inequality does not hold.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1-2)(1+1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0\). So, the inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3-2)(3+1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \geq 0\). So, the inequality does not hold.

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]\). Since \(a > 0\), the maximum value of \(a\) is \(2\).

### Case 2: \(a < 0\)
- For \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening downwards. The maximum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval is \(f(a) = a^3\).
- For \(x < a\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a straight line with a negative slope. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\).

For the function to cover all real values, the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the interval \(x \geq a\) must be greater than or equal to the value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) in the interval \(x < a\). However, since \(f(x)\) in the interval \(x < a\) can take any value from \(\infty\) to \(a^2 + 2a\), the maximum value \(a^3\) must be greater than or equal to \(a^2 + 2a\).

We solve the inequality \(a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a\):
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0\]
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0\]
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\]

The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2-2)(-2+1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \geq 0\). So, the inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5-2)(-0.5+1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \leq 0\). So, the inequality does not hold.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1-2)(1+1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0\). So, the inequality does not hold.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3-2)(3+1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \geq 0\). So, the inequality holds.

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\) holds for \(a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]\). Since \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(a\) is \(-1\).

Comparing the maximum values from both cases, the overall maximum value of \(a\) is \(2\).

Thus, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the value of \( c \) in the equation of the circle \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

Given that the radius \( r \) is 1, the standard form becomes \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = 1^2 = 1\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms in the given equation.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since we know that the standard form of the circle's equation is \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 1\), we can set the right sides equal to each other:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the solutions to \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). Since \(\lambda > 0\), the inequality \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) simplifies to \(\lambda \ge 1\), and the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is always true. Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in \([0,1]\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\), so \(y\) is also a fixed point of \(f\) or a point such that \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) \neq x\), \(y \neq x\). Therefore, \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) and \(x = f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\).

We calculate \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\):
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
This implies that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), which contradicts \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, \(y\) must be a point such that \(f(y) = x\).

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) has a solution \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). We start by finding the fixed points of \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).
\]
We need to solve:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a quartic equation in \(x\). However, we know that \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\) are solutions, and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution if \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there is another solution \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its fixed points, we find that the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are:

"To solve the given problem, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\). The expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]

Using these formulas, we can rewrite the numerator as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Next, we rewrite the denominator as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We can further simplify this by using the angle addition formulas again. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ
\]

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ = -\sin 35^\circ
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose tangent is \(-\sqrt{3}\) and is the smallest positive angle is:

\[
\theta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times \ldots \times n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the repeated items.

In our case:
- Total characters (n) = 7
- Frequency of E (n_E) = 2
- Frequency of L (n_L) = 2
- Frequency of I (n_I) = 1
- Frequency of P (n_P) = 1
- Frequency of S (n_S) = 1

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the product.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by the powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

\[

\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Since all higher powers of 5 will result in fractions less than 1, their integer parts will be 0. Therefore, we sum the values:

Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}\). Then, the function becomes:

\[

The maximum value of \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\) is 1, which occurs when \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi\) for any integer \(k\). Since \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}\), the only relevant solution is \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

"To determine the number of positive two-digit integers that are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. Therefore, the common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of the product of the lowest powers of these common prime factors, which is:
\[ 2^1 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

The factors of 50 are:
\[ 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 \]

We are only interested in the two-digit factors of 50. From the list above, the two-digit factors are:
\[ 10, 25, 50 \]

Thus, there are 3 positive two-digit integers that are factors of both 100 and 150. Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) make \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as \( (2^k)^n \) for some integer \( k \). This implies that \( 24 = kn \), so \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are the positive integers that divide 24 without leaving a remainder. We can find them by checking which integers from 1 to 24 satisfy this condition:

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
\]

Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:

\[

There are 7 such divisors. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

   \[
   x + y = 11
   \]

2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents:
   \[
   10x + 5y = 75
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 11 - x
\]

Next, we substitute \( y \) into the second equation:
\[
10x + 5(11 - x) = 75
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
10x + 55 - 5x = 75

\[
5x + 55 = 75
\]
\[
5x = 75 - 55

\[

\[

Now that we have \( x \), we can find \( y \):

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We can use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \), so \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Since the roots of \( f(x) \) sum to 49, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5 \), \( r_2 - 5 \), and \( r_3 - 5 \), where \( r_1 \), \( r_2 \), and \( r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the property of modular inverses. If \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, then we have:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \) is symmetric around 0 modulo 23):

\[ 1^2 = 1 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 = 4 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 = 9 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 = 16 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two possible solutions for \( t \):

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical tank to the volume of one cylindrical beaker.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker:
\[ \text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

 First, we can use the difference of squares formula, which states that \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \).

Here, let \( a = 513 \) and \( b = 487 \).

Now, we calculate \( a - b \) and \( a + b \):

1. Calculate \( a - b \):
   \[
   a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

2. Calculate \( a + b \):

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x-2 = 64\)
2. \(x-2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x-2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x-2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

"To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) holds, we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), we can simplify this to:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:
\[ -2 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies further to:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]
Therefore, the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) are:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).

Next, we use the identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting the known value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 4p).
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 4p\right),

\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 4p^3}{p^2},

\[

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

### Step 1: Factor the denominator
The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the numerator
The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of a quadratic expression. We can factor \(x^2 - 81\) as:
\[
x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9)
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|
\]

### Step 3: Determine the critical points
The critical points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. These points are:
\[
x = 0, \quad x = 9, \quad x = -9, \quad x = 36
\]

### Step 4: Test the intervals determined by the critical points
We need to test the sign of the expression \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

#### Interval \((-\infty, -9)\)
Choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10 - 9)(-10 + 9)|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{10 \cdot (-46)} = \frac{19}{-460} < 0
\]
The expression is negative.

#### Interval \((-9, 0)\)
Choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1 - 9)(-1 + 9)|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{1 \cdot (-37)} = \frac{80}{-37} < 0
\]
The expression is negative.

#### Interval \((0, 9)\)
Choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1 - 9)(1 + 9)|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1 \cdot (-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0
\]
The expression is negative.

#### Interval \((9, 36)\)
Choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|(10 - 9)(10 + 9)|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|(1)(19)|}{10 \cdot (-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0
\]
The expression is negative.

#### Interval \((36, \infty)\)
Choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|(37 - 9)(37 + 9)|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|(28)(46)|}{37 \cdot 1} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive.

### Step 5: Consider the critical points
The expression \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.

### Step 6: Combine the results
The expression is negative in the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the graph \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance \(d\) from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((x, y)\) is given by the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \(y\) into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To minimize \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by finding the critical points of \(f(x)\) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
The solutions to \(f'(x) = 0\) are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]
In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a = 10\) is not divisible by any square other than 1, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[

   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3

   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):

   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0

   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To determine how many digits are common between the base-7 and base-8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base-7 and base-8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base-7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base-7 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base-8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base-8 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Identify common digits

Now we compare the digits in the base-7 representation \(1556_7\) and the base-8 representation \(1165_8\).

The digits in \(1556_7\) are: \(1, 5, 6\)

The digits in \(1165_8\) are: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are: \(1, 5, 6\)

### Step 4: Count the common digits

There are 3 common digits: \(1, 5, 6\).

Thus, the number of common digits between the base-7 and base-8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}
\] です。

 First, we note that the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\) can be factored as follows:
\[
x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 + x + 2).
\]
The roots of \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\) are the non-real cube roots of unity, \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The roots of \(x^2 + x + 2 = 0\) are:
\[
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-7}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{7}}{2}.
\]
Thus, the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2}, \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2}\).

We now need to evaluate the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) for all possible pairings of the roots. Without loss of generality, let \(\alpha_1 = \omega\), \(\alpha_2 = \omega^2\), \(\alpha_3 = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2}\), and \(\alpha_4 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2}\).

First, we calculate \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\):
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \omega \cdot \omega^2 = \omega^3 = 1,
\]
\[
\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \left(\frac{-1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{-1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2}\right) = \frac{(-1)^2 - (i\sqrt{7})^2}{4} = \frac{1 + 7}{4} = 2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 1 + 2 = 3.
\]

Next, we calculate \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\):
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 = \omega \cdot \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{-\omega + i\omega\sqrt{7}}{2},
\]
\[
\alpha_2\alpha_4 = \omega^2 \cdot \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{-\omega^2 - i\omega^2\sqrt{7}}{2},
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \frac{-\omega + i\omega\sqrt{7} - \omega^2 - i\omega^2\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{-(\omega + \omega^2) + i\sqrt{7}(\omega - \omega^2)}{2}.
\]
Since \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\) and \(\omega - \omega^2 = i\sqrt{3}\), we have:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \frac{-(-1) + i\sqrt{7}(i\sqrt{3})}{2} = \frac{1 - 7}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3.
\]

Finally, we calculate \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\):
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_4 = \omega \cdot \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{-\omega - i\omega\sqrt{7}}{2},
\]
\[
\alpha_2\alpha_3 = \omega^2 \cdot \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{-\omega^2 + i\omega^2\sqrt{7}}{2},
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \frac{-\omega - i\omega\sqrt{7} - \omega^2 + i\omega^2\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{-(\omega + \omega^2) + i\sqrt{7}(\omega^2 - \omega)}{2}.
\]
Since \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\) and \(\omega^2 - \omega = -i\sqrt{3}\), we have:

\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \frac{-(-1) + i\sqrt{7}(-i\sqrt{3})}{2} = \frac{1 + 7}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Let the coordinates of the vertices be:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

Given that the ratio of the lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) is \(k\), we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = k \implies \frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \implies a = kb
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where \(d_O < d_A\), \(d_O < d_B\), \(d_O < d_C\), and \(d_O < d_D\). Let's start with the inequality \(d_O < d_A\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by < -a^2 - b^2 \implies ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:
\[
d_O < d_B \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
d_O < d_C \implies -ax + by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
d_O < d_D \implies -ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These four inequalities define a smaller rectangle centered at the origin with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\right) \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{16a^2b^2}
\]

Substituting \(a = kb\), we get:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(k^2b^2 + b^2)^2}{16(kb)^2b^2} = \frac{(b^2(k^2 + 1))^2}{16k^2b^4} = \frac{b^4(k^2 + 1)^2}{16k^2b^4} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{16k^2}
\]

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To find the shortest distance from any point \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) to visit the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and calculate the total distance for each possible route.

First, let's list the distances between the points:
- \( AB = 6 \)
- \( AC = 6 \)
- \( AD = 5 \)
- \( BC = 5 \)
- \( BD = 3 \)
- \( CD = 4 \)

We will calculate the total distance for each starting point and each possible route.

### Starting at Point \( A \)
1. Route \( A \to B \to C \to D \):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
2. Route \( A \to B \to D \to C \):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13
   \]
3. Route \( A \to C \to B \to D \):
   \[
   AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
4. Route \( A \to C \to D \to B \):
   \[
   AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
   \]
5. Route \( A \to D \to B \to C \):
   \[
   AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
6. Route \( A \to D \to C \to B \):
   \[
   AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]

The shortest distance starting at \( A \) is \( 13 \).

### Starting at Point \( B \)
1. Route \( B \to A \to C \to D \):
   \[
   BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16
   \]
2. Route \( B \to A \to D \to C \):
   \[
   BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
3. Route \( B \to C \to A \to D \):
   \[
   BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. Route \( B \to C \to D \to A \):
   \[
   BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]
5. Route \( B \to D \to A \to C \):
   \[
   BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
6. Route \( B \to D \to C \to A \):
   \[
   BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13
   \]

The shortest distance starting at \( B \) is \( 13 \).

### Starting at Point \( C \)
1. Route \( C \to A \to B \to D \):
   \[
   CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15
   \]
2. Route \( C \to A \to D \to B \):
   \[
   CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
3. Route \( C \to B \to A \to D \):
   \[
   CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. Route \( C \to B \to D \to A \):
   \[
   CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
5. Route \( C \to D \to A \to B \):
   \[
   CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]
6. Route \( C \to D \to B \to A \):
   \[
   CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13
   \]

The shortest distance starting at \( C \) is \( 13 \).

### Starting at Point \( D \)
1. Route \( D \to A \to B \to C \):
   \[
   DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
2. Route \( D \to A \to C \to B \):
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
3. Route \( D \to B \to A \to C \):
   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]
4. Route \( D \to B \to C \to A \):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
5. Route \( D \to C \to A \to B \):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
   \]
6. Route \( D \to C \to B \to A \):
   \[
   DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

The shortest distance starting at \( D \) is \( 14 \).

The overall shortest distance from any point to visit the other three points exactly once is the minimum of the shortest distances starting at each point, which is \( 13 \).

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
