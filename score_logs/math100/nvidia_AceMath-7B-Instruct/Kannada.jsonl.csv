"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:
   \[
   z'' = z' e^{i\theta}
   \]
   For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3i - 3i^2
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3i + 3
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For this term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
5k = 15 \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We know that \(\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10\), so the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2) = (7k + 2 + 2) = 7k + 4
\]
\[
(n + 4) = (7k + 2 + 4) = 7k + 6
\]
\[
(n + 6) = (7k + 2 + 6) = 7k + 8
\]

Now, the expression becomes:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

Since we are interested in the remainder when this expression is divided by 7, we can simplify each term modulo 7:

\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7 is:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24
\]

Next, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 3

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is:

"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 6}{2}, \frac{3 + 8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7 + x}{2}, \frac{4 + y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7 + x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4 + y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this arrangement is not possible either. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6 + 7}{2}, \frac{8 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5 + x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3 + y}{2} = 6 \implies 3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. So, we need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   We can factorize the quadratic expression as follows:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,
   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

"To find the smallest positive constant \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute the transpose of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \):
\[ A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Next, we find the product \( A^T A \):
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Now, we need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[ \det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16. \]

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}. \]
Thus, the eigenvalues are:
\[ \lambda_1 = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1. \]

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Hence, the smallest positive constant \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1.

"Let's denote the cost of a tree as \( T \), the cost of a squig as \( S \), and the cost of a goolee as \( G \).

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by multiplying the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) and then comparing the resulting polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare this polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By comparing the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step. From the fourth equation, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation and solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2

Now we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the second equation to verify:

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its behavior for different values of \(x\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) has a minimum value at \(x = 0\), which is \(f(0) = 0\). As \(x\) increases, \(f(x)\) increases without bound.
- If \(a < 0\), the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) has a maximum value at \(x = 0\), which is \(f(0) = 0\). As \(x\) increases, \(f(x)\) decreases without bound.

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is increasing. As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\).
- If \(a < 0\), the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is decreasing. As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the graph to intersect every horizontal line at most once
For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at most once, the function must be one-to-one. This means that the function must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

- If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is increasing, and the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) is also increasing. However, we need to check if there is any overlap in the values of \(f(x)\) at the boundary \(x = a\).
  - At \(x = a\), \(f(a) = a^3\).
  - As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\).
  - For the function to be one-to-one, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).
    \[
    a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0
    \]
    \[
    a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0
    \]
    \[
    a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0
    \]
    The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Testing the intervals, we find that the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 0] \cup [2, \infty)\). Since \(a > 0\), the valid interval is \(a \in [2, \infty)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is decreasing, and the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) is also decreasing. However, we need to check if there is any overlap in the values of \(f(x)\) at the boundary \(x = a\).
  - At \(x = a\), \(f(a) = a^3\).
  - As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\).
  - For the function to be one-to-one, we need \(a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a\).
    \[
    a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0
    \]
    \[
    a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0
    \]
    \[
    a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0
    \]
    The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Testing the intervals, we find that the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0\) holds for \(a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]\). Since \(a < 0\), the valid interval is \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\).

### Step 4: Find the maximum value of \(a\)
From the intervals \(a \in [2, \infty)\) and \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\), the maximum value of \(a\) is \(2\).

Thus, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at most once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the value of \( c \) for which the radius of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) is 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x \in [0,1]\) and \(f(x) \neq x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (assuming \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's start by finding \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x),
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

For the second case, we need to solve:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 = 1 \implies -\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) and \(x \neq 0\). Let's test the fixed points \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) in the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\).

For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\):
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = (\lambda - 1) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, and we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) for some \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the equation \(-\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0\), we find that the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are \(\lambda = 2\) and \(\lambda = 4\).

"To solve for the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) that satisfies the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\).

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:
\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]

Using these formulas, we can rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities for cosine, we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ
\]

Now, we rewrite the denominator as:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities for sine, we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\cos 55^\circ

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:
\[

The minimum positive angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[

\[

"To find the area of triangle \(ENG\), we start by understanding the properties of the medians and the centroid of a triangle. The centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Given that \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar because \(MN \parallel BC\). The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians, which is \(2:1\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AC\) and \(G\) divides \(BE\) in the ratio \(2:1\), triangle \(EGC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of triangle \(BEC\). Similarly, triangle \(EGC\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of triangle \(EGC\) because \(N\) is the midpoint of \(AC\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(EGC\) is \(\frac{1}{6}\) of the area of triangle \(AMN\).

Thus, the area of triangle \(EGC\) is:
\[

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the roots of \( f(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \). Let's denote these roots by \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots is:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49.

Now, consider the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \), which is equivalent to \( f(x+5) = 0 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula is:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon. We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[

\]

Next, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \(n-2\) must be a whole number (because \(n\) is the number of sides of a polygon), we round \(5.9444\) to the nearest whole number, which is \(6\). Therefore:

"To find the integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the condition:

\[
(t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic congruence:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test the values from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[

\]
\[
t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23}
\]

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. To verify, we check both values:

For \( t = 4 \):
\[
(t + 2) \cdot t = 6 \cdot 4 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

For \( t = 17 \):

Both values satisfy the condition. Therefore, the solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). The problem asks for one of these values, so we can choose either. For the sake of a single answer, we will choose the smaller one.

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our problem, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the expression inside the sine function becomes

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x).
\]

So the equation simplifies to

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get

\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.

So the equation becomes

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply to get

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). Substituting these values in, we get

\[
10 \times \frac{7}{10} = 7

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circumference of the circle. The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the order of selection of the points does not matter, we can fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in the remaining positions. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the points, which is \(6\) ways.

Next, we need to count the number of these arrangements where the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern. There are exactly 2 such arrangements for any fixed point \(A\): \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Therefore, there are \(2\) ways to arrange the points such that the chords intersect.

The probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements. Thus, the probability is:
\[
\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To find the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the two circles and the shaded region. The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The total area of the two circles is:
\[
\pi + 4\pi = 5\pi
\]
The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of these two areas:
\[
2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
\]
We set this equal to the area of the shaded region we calculated earlier:
\[

Solving for \(\theta\), we get:
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}

To convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees, we use the fact that \(\pi\) radians is 180 degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180}{3} = 120

"To determine how many cylindrical buckets of water are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical bucket and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical bucket. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical bucket, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical buckets of water are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical bucket:
\[ \text{Number of buckets} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical buckets of water needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Therefore, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
Since \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\), we need to find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Substituting these values into the angle addition formula, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]

Next, we use the angle subtraction formula for sine:
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]
Substituting the values we found, we get:
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3})}{100}
\]
This is a difference of squares, so we have:
\[
(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2\sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9

"To form a 5-member committee with at least one representative from each party, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

1. **Total Ways to Choose 5 Members from 14**:

   - Total ways to choose 5 members from 14 = \( \binom{14}{5} \).

2. **Ways to Choose 5 Members with No Republicans**:

"Given a triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\), we need to find the perimeter of the triangle given that \(D\) is a point on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\).

Given that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), we can use the fact that \(D\) lies on the altitude \(AM\). The point \(D\) divides \(AM\) into segments \(AD = 10\) and \(DM = 1\).

We can use the tangent function to relate the angles and the sides of the triangle. In \(\triangle ABD\),
\[
\tan \angle ABD = \frac{AD}{BD} = \frac{10}{BD}.
\]
In \(\triangle BDC\),
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \frac{BC}{BD} = \frac{BC}{BD}.
\]
Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), we have
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}.
\]
We also know that \(\tan \theta = \frac{BC}{2AM} = \frac{BC}{22}\). Let \(BC = a\). Then,
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{a}{22}.
\]
Substituting \(\tan \theta\) into the triple angle formula, we get
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{a}{22} - \left(\frac{a}{22}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{a}{22}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3a}{22} - \frac{a^3}{10648}}{1 - \frac{3a^2}{484}} = \frac{\frac{3a \cdot 484 - a^3}{10648}}{\frac{484 - 3a^2}{484}} = \frac{3a \cdot 484 - a^3}{10648} \cdot \frac{484}{484 - 3a^2} = \frac{3a \cdot 484 - a^3}{22(484 - 3a^2)}.
\]
Since \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{a}{BD}\) and \(BD = \sqrt{AB^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 10^2}\), we need to find \(AB\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle AMB\),
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]
Thus,
\[
BD = \sqrt{121 + \frac{a^2}{4} - 100} = \sqrt{21 + \frac{a^2}{4}}.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\tan 3\theta\),
\[
\frac{3a \cdot 484 - a^3}{22(484 - 3a^2)} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{21 + \frac{a^2}{4}}}.
\]
Solving this equation, we find \(a = 22\). Therefore, \(BC = 22\).

Now, we can find \(AB\):
\[
AB = \sqrt{121 + \frac{22^2}{4}} = \sqrt{121 + 121} = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}.

Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two parts and solve each part separately.

### Part 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\]

Notice that the left-hand side can be factored as a perfect square:
\[(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\]

The expression \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number, which is always non-negative. The only way it can be zero is if \(x^2 + 2 = 0\), but this equation has no real solutions because \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Therefore, \((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\) for all real \(x\).

So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

### Part 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\]

Notice that the left-hand side can be factored as:
\[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\]

We need to determine where the product \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3)\) is negative. The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive because \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Therefore, the sign of the product depends on the factor \(x^2 - 3\).

The factor \(x^2 - 3\) is negative when \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\). Therefore, the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) is satisfied when \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

### Combine the Solutions

Since the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\), the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is the same as the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), which is:

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),

\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),

\[

Next, we use the identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[

Substituting the known value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the seventh vertex of the regular hexagon, we start by considering the geometric properties of a regular hexagon and the given distances from \( P \) to the first five vertices.

A regular hexagon can be inscribed in a circle, and the vertices of the hexagon divide the circle into six equal arcs. Let the center of the circle be \( O \), and the radius of the circle be \( R \). The vertices of the hexagon can be labeled as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \) in a clockwise manner, with \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 \) being the first five vertices and \( A_6 \) being the seventh vertex.

Given the distances from \( P \) to the first five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to \( A_6 \).

Using the property of a regular hexagon, the distance between any two adjacent vertices is equal to the side length of the hexagon, which is also equal to the radius \( R \) of the circumscribed circle. The distance between any two vertices that are two positions apart is \( R\sqrt{3} \), and the distance between any two opposite vertices is \( 2R \).

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a regular polygon is constant and equal to \( nR^2 + n \cdot d^2 \), where \( n \) is the number of vertices and \( d \) is the distance from the point to the center of the polygon. For a regular hexagon, \( n = 6 \).

Let \( d \) be the distance from \( P \) to the center \( O \). Then, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 6R^2 + 6d^2, \]
where \( x \) is the distance from \( P \) to \( A_6 \).

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324. \]

So, we have:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 6R^2 + 6d^2. \]

Since \( R^2 = d^2 + R^2 \) (because \( R \) is the radius and \( d \) is the distance from \( P \) to the center), we can simplify the equation to:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 6R^2 + 6d^2 = 6R^2 + 6R^2 = 12R^2. \]

We know that \( R^2 = \frac{324 + x^2}{12} \).

To find \( x \), we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is constant. Therefore, we can use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to \( 6R^2 + 6d^2 \).

By trial and error or using the fact that the distances are symmetric, we find that \( x = 6 \).

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the seventh vertex is:

"To determine how many numbers between 1 and 629 in base 10 are represented by the same number in both base 7 and base 8, we need to find the numbers that have the same digits in both bases. Let's start by converting the number 629 from base 10 to both base 7 and base 8.

First, convert 629 to base 7:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1
\]
So, \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

Next, convert 629 to base 8:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1
\]
So, \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

Now, we need to find the numbers between 1 and 629 that have the same digits in both base 7 and base 8. Let's consider the possible forms of these numbers. Since the digits in base 7 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the digits in base 8 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the only common digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Therefore, the numbers must be composed only of these digits.

We will check the numbers with 1, 2, and 3 digits in both bases.

**1-digit numbers:**
The 1-digit numbers in both bases are the same: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. There are 6 such numbers.

**2-digit numbers:**
Let the number be \(ab_7\) in base 7 and \(ab_8\) in base 8, where \(a\) and \(b\) are digits from 1 to 6. The value of the number in base 10 is \(7a + b\) in base 7 and \(8a + b\) in base 8. For the number to be the same in both bases, we must have:
\[
7a + b = 8a + b \implies 0 = a
\]
This is not possible since \(a\) cannot be 0. Therefore, there are no 2-digit numbers that are the same in both bases.

**3-digit numbers:**
Let the number be \(abc_7\) in base 7 and \(abc_8\) in base 8, where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits from 1 to 6. The value of the number in base 10 is \(49a + 7b + c\) in base 7 and \(512a + 64b + 8c\) in base 8. For the number to be the same in both bases, we must have:
\[
49a + 7b + c = 512a + 64b + 8c \implies 0 = 463a + 57b + 7c
\]
This is not possible since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive digits. Therefore, there are no 3-digit numbers that are the same in both bases.

Thus, the only numbers between 1 and 629 that have the same digits in both base 7 and base 8 are the 1-digit numbers. There are 6 such numbers.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to understand that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). This is because substituting \( x = 1 \) into the polynomial effectively sums all the coefficients.

Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we need to find \( g(1) \). This is equivalent to finding \( f(1-1) = f(0) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

To find \( f(0) \), we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial:
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the perpendicular distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the perpendicular distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. That is,

\[
a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

From Vieta's formulas, we know that

\[
a + b + c = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product \(abc\). We have

\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so instead, we use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial whose coefficients are symmetric functions of the roots of the original polynomial. The polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by

\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0.
\]

Since \(a + b + c = 0\), the polynomial simplifies to

\[
t^3 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0.
\]

We need to find \(ab + bc + ca\) and \(abc\). Using the identity for the product of the roots taken two at a time, we have

\[
ab + bc + ca = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Expanding each term and simplifying, we get

\[
ab + bc + ca = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) = 2 \cdot 0 = 0.
\]

Thus, the polynomial simplifies to

\[
t^3 - abc = 0.
\]

To find \(abc\), we use the fact that

\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 2^2 = 4.

Therefore, the polynomial is

\[
t^3 - 4 = 0,
\]

and the roots are

"To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Assume \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is given by:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is given by:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

For the point \((x, y)\) to be closer to the center \(O\) than to the vertex \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

This inequality represents a line that divides the plane into two regions. The region satisfying \(ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\) is the region closer to the center \(O\) than to the vertex \(A\).

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other vertices:
- For vertex \(B = (a, b)\): \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For vertex \(C = (a, -b)\): \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For vertex \(D = (-a, -b)\): \(-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\) or \(ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

These four inequalities together define a smaller rectangle inside the original rectangle \(ABCD\) whose center is also \(O\) and whose side lengths are half of the original rectangle's side lengths. The side lengths of the smaller rectangle are \(a/2\) and \(b/2\).

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = 2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}} = a \times b = ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the values of the three terms together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega \neq 1\) and \(\omega^2 \neq 1\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We can expand it as follows:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
