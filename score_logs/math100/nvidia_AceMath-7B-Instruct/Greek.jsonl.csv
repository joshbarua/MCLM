"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate the complex number \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.**
   This is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise.**
   Rotating a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, we multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   = \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} - 3i \frac{2}{2} - 3i^2 \frac{2}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate the rotated complex number back so that \( c \) is at its original position.**
   This is done by adding \( c \) to the rotated complex number:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True

"To determine the number of ways 8 atoms can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super atom"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""atoms"" (the block and the other 5 atoms) in a circle.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""atoms"" to arrange in a circle, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 atoms such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""atoms"" in a circle and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This gives us:

\[ 120 \times 6 = 720 \]

Thus, the number of ways 8 atoms can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True

"To determine the minimum number of rotations required for a regular pentagon to return to its original position when rotated counterclockwise around its center, we need to understand the properties of rotational symmetry of a regular pentagon.

A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5. This means that it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \). Therefore, the pentagon will return to its original position after every 72-degree rotation.

To find the minimum number of counterclockwise rotations needed to return to the original position, we need to determine how many 72-degree rotations are required to sum up to a full 360-degree rotation. This can be calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{72^\circ} = 5
\]

Thus, the minimum number of counterclockwise rotations required for the pentagon to return to its original position is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the other possible diagonal, which is the one connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\).

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid. The correct approach is to consider the other possible diagonal, which is the one connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\).

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the value of \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine.

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
   \[
   f(7) = \frac{2 \cdot 7}{7^2 - 5 \cdot 7 - 14} = \frac{14}{49 - 35 - 14} = \frac{14}{0} \quad \text{(undefined)}
   \]
   \[
   f(-2) = \frac{2 \cdot (-2)}{(-2)^2 - 5 \cdot (-2) - 14} = \frac{-4}{4 + 10 - 14} = \frac{-4}{0} \quad \text{(undefined)}
   \]
   Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials of degrees \( n \) and \( m \) respectively, depends on the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \):
   - If \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
   - If \( n = m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \).
   - If \( n > m \), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).
   For the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator \( n \) is 1 and the degree of the denominator \( m \) is 2. Since \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in my head, I can break it down into simpler steps.

1. First, calculate \(99^2\):
   \[
   99^2 = 99 \times 99
   \]
   To find \(99 \times 99\), I can use the formula for the square of a binomial:
   \[
   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

\]
holds for all vectors \(\bold{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the given information and use the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We are given that the tank is being filled with water at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the height \( h \) of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour.

The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is the derivative of the volume with respect to time, \( \frac{dV}{dt} \). Similarly, the rate at which the height is increasing is the derivative of the height with respect to time, \( \frac{dh}{dt} \). From the volume formula, we can differentiate both sides with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case \(x \geq a\):
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases, so it will not intersect every horizontal line.

Next, consider the case \(x < a\):
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) increases without bound as \(x\) decreases, and if \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x)\) decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases.

For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, it must cover all real values. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\). Since \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) decreases without bound if \(a > 0\), the only way to ensure that \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line is if \(a \leq 0\).

However, we need to find the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once. The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this condition is \(a = 0\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0, 4]\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0, 1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). We solve the equation:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

The fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)). We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0, 1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(x\) is not a fixed point but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's denote \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into the equation \(f(y) = x\):

\[ f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Using the definition of \(f\), we get:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

This is a quartic equation in \(x\). However, we know that \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) are solutions to \(f(x) = x\), so they are not periodic points of period 2. Therefore, we need to find the other solutions to the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\) that are not fixed points.

To simplify, let's consider the case when \(\lambda = 2\). Then the function becomes:

\[ f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2. \]

We need to solve:

\[ f(f(x)) = x. \]

First, find \(f(x)\):

\[ f(x) = 2x - 2x^2. \]

Now, find \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2). \]

We need to solve:

\[ 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = x. \]

This is a quartic equation, but we can check if there are any solutions other than the fixed points \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). By trial and error or using numerical methods, we can find that there are indeed other solutions in the interval \([0, 1]\) for \(\lambda = 2\).

"To find the measure of the smaller positive angle \(\theta\) for which the given expression holds, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\).

The given expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:
\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these formulas, we can rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Similarly, we can rewrite the denominator as:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ (-\sin 30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Therefore, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.

The angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) and is the smaller positive angle is:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

\[

Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

The maximum value of the sine function is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only relevant solution is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of these two numbers that are two-digit integers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. Therefore, the common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of the product of the lowest powers of these common prime factors, which is:

The factors of 50 are:

This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \). Therefore, we need to find the number of divisors of \( 24 \) that are greater than \( 1 \).

First, we list the divisors of \( 24 \). The number \( 24 \) can be factored as \( 24 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \). The total number of divisors of \( 24 \) is given by \((3+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 2 = 8\). These divisors are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, \) and \( 24 \).

"To determine how many pentares (5 cents each) Hilar has, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of pentares by \( p \) and the number of ducats (10 cents each) by \( d \).

The total value of the coins is given as 75 cents. Since each pentare is worth 5 cents and each ducat is worth 10 cents, we can write the equation:
\[ 5p + 10d = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ p + 2d = 15 \]

This equation tells us that the number of pentares plus twice the number of ducats equals 15. To find the number of pentares, we need to consider that \( d \) must be a non-negative integer. Let's test possible values for \( d \):

1. If \( d = 0 \), then \( p = 15 \).
2. If \( d = 1 \), then \( p = 13 \).
3. If \( d = 2 \), then \( p = 11 \).

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Tzésis is even, we first need to identify the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to understand the conditions under which the sum of two numbers is even. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the rest are odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the possible choices for Paul and Tzésis:**
   - Paul can choose any of the six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.
   - Tzésis can also choose any of the six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Since each person has 6 choices, the total number of possible outcomes is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

3. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes (where the sum is even):**
   - The sum is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.
   - There is only one even number (2), so the only way both numbers can be even is if both Paul and Tzésis choose 2. This gives us 1 favorable outcome.
   - There are 5 odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13), so the number of ways both numbers can be odd is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).
   - Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is \(1 + 25 = 26\).

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   - So, the probability is \(\frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}\).

Thus, the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Tzésis is even is \(\boxed{\frac{13}{18}}\).","[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",True

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Since the number must consist only of the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to be divisible by 25. Additionally, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 to be divisible by 9.

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so the expression becomes:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \sin^2 80^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 10^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \cdot 4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 10^\circ = 3 \sin^4 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]

We can use the double-angle identity \(\cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ - 1\) and \(\cos^2 10^\circ = \frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). Applying this identity, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Determine the measure of the missing interior angle:**
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is:

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Find the range for \(x\):**
   The measure of an interior angle of a convex polygon is always less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(0 < x < 180^\circ\).

5. **Estimate the value of \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the approximate value of \(n\) by assuming \(x\) is close to its maximum value, which is just less than \(180^\circ\). If \(x\) were exactly \(180^\circ\), the equation would be:

   The sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), which is not possible since the sum of all interior angles of a 7-sided polygon is only \(900^\circ\). Therefore, \(n\) must be less than 7.

   The sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), which is not possible since the sum of all interior angles of a 6-sided polygon is only \(720^\circ\). Therefore, \(n\) must be less than 6.

   The sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), which is not possible since the sum of all interior angles of a 5-sided polygon is only \(540^\circ\). Therefore, \(n\) must be less than 5.

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test the values from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[ 1^2 = 1, \quad 2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \]

\[ 9^2 = 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \quad 10^2 = 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \quad 11^2 = 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}. \]
Thus, the modular square root of 2 modulo 23 is 5. Therefore, we have:
\[ t = -1 \pm 5. \]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4, \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Calculate \( g \) of the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Next, we proceed to step 3. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:
\[ g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This simplifies to

\[
2 \tan^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Solving for \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), we get

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{4}.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we compute \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the rectangle with vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values for the interior points:**
   - The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-5\) to \(5\). For a point to be strictly inside the rectangle, its \(x\)-coordinate must be between \(-5\) and \(5\), exclusive. Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of the interior points must be in the range \(-4 \leq x \leq 4\).
   - The \(y\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-4\) to \(4\). For a point to be strictly inside the rectangle, its \(y\)-coordinate must be between \(-4\) and \(4\), exclusive. Therefore, the \(y\)-coordinates of the interior points must be in the range \(-3 \leq y \leq 3\).

2. **Count the number of integer points in the specified ranges:**
   - The possible integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are 9 such values.
   - The possible integer values for \(y\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). There are 7 such values.

3. **Calculate the total number of interior points:**
   - Since each \(x\)-value can pair with each \(y\)-value, the total number of interior points is the product of the number of possible \(x\)-values and the number of possible \(y\)-values. Therefore, the total number of interior points is \(9 \times 7 = 63\).

Thus, the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangle is \(\boxed{63}\).","[63, '63']",63,"[63, '63']",True
"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the properties of the cross product. The cross product is distributive over vector addition, so we can expand the expression as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose and arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the points.

Next, we need to count the number of permutations where the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, these permutations must be alternating. There are exactly 2 such alternating permutations for any given set of 4 points: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Since the starting point \(A\) can be any of the 4 points, we have 4 choices for \(A\), and for each choice of \(A\), there are 2 valid permutations of the remaining points. Therefore, the total number of valid permutations is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

The probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of valid permutations to the total number of permutations. Thus, the probability is:

The total area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:

The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical pot. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical pot, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

So the equation becomes:

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[

Thus, the equation is now:

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

This gives us two possible equations:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\). The point \(D\) lies on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Since \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\), the base angles \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle ACB\) are equal. Therefore, \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\).

Next, we need to use the given condition \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(D\) lies on the height \(AM\), we can use the properties of similar triangles and trigonometry to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Consider the right triangle \(AMD\). Here, \(AD = 10\) and \(AM = 11\), so \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). The tangent of \(\angle MDC\) is given by:
\[
\tan \angle MDC = \frac{DM}{MC} = \frac{1}{MC}
\]
Similarly, the tangent of \(\angle MDA\) is:
\[
\tan \angle MDA = \frac{AD}{MD} = \frac{10}{MD}
\]
Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle MDC = \angle BDC\), we have:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{1}{MC}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for tangent, we get:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}
\]
We also know that:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot MC}
\]
Let \(BC = 2a\). Then:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{a}{MC}
\]
Substituting \(\tan \theta = \frac{a}{MC}\) into the triple angle identity, we get:
\[
\frac{3 \cdot \frac{a}{MC} - \left(\frac{a}{MC}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{a}{MC}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{MC}
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{3a - \frac{a^3}{MC^2}}{MC^2 - 3a^2} = \frac{1}{MC}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(MC(MC^2 - 3a^2)\), we get:
\[
3a \cdot MC - a^3 = MC^2 - 3a^2
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
3a \cdot MC - MC^2 = a^3 - 3a^2
\]
Factoring out \(MC\) on the left side and \(a^2\) on the right side, we get:
\[
MC(3a - MC) = a^2(a - 3)
\]
Since \(MC = \frac{a}{\tan 3\theta}\) and \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{1}{MC}\), we have:
\[
MC = \frac{a}{\frac{1}{MC}} = a
\]
Substituting \(MC = a\) into the equation, we get:
\[
a(3a - a) = a^2(a - 3)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
2a^2 = a^3 - 3a^2
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
a^3 - 5a^2 = 0
\]
Factoring out \(a^2\), we get:
\[
a^2(a - 5) = 0
\]
Since \(a \neq 0\), we have:
\[
a = 5
\]
Therefore, \(BC = 2a = 10\).

Now, we need to find the length of \(AB\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(AMC\), we get:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + MC^2 = 11^2 + 5^2 = 121 + 25 = 146
\]
So:
\[
AB = \sqrt{146}
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2\sqrt{146} + 10
\]
Thus, the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. Given that the sum is \(3^7\), we calculate:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative, which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\). This inequality is always true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

We start by making a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two roots: \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola that opens upwards (since the coefficient of \(y^2\) is positive). Therefore, the expression is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). So, we have:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]

Recall that \(y = x^2\). Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the part of the solution where \(y < 0\). Thus, we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and properties of symmetric polynomials.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - 3xyz/s) = s(s^2 - 3p - 3 \cdot 4/s) = s(s^2 - 3p - 12/s),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]

Substitute \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p} \left( \left( \frac{12}{p} \right)^2 - 3p - 12 \cdot \frac{12}{p} \right) = \frac{12}{p} \left( \frac{144}{p^2} - 3p - \frac{144}{p} \right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3 - 144}{p^2} = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{-3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12}{p} \cdot (-3p) = -36.\]

This simplifies to:
\[-8 = -36,\]
which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we can use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are \(x, y, z\) is:
\[t^3 - st^2 + pt - 4 = 0.\]

Given the symmetry and the values, we can test specific values. Let's try \(x = 2, y = 1, z = 2\):
\[xyz = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4,\]
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 2^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 = 8 + 1 + 8 = 17,\]
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 2 \cdot 1^2 + 2^2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 2^2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1^2 \cdot 2 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 28.\]

This does not satisfy the given equations. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are \(x, y, z\) is:
\[t^3 - st^2 + pt - 4 = 0.\]

Given the symmetry and the values, we can test specific values. Let's try \(x = 2, y = 1, z = 2\):
\[x = 2, y = 1, z = 2\]
\[xy + yz + zx = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 2 = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.\]

"To determine for which class the number of students using the library is more than \(135\%\) of the number of students using the computer lab, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students using the library and the computer lab for each class.
2. Compare the number of students using the library to \(135\%\) of the number of students using the computer lab for each class.

First, let's calculate the number of students using the library and the computer lab for each class:

- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class:
  - Number of students using the library: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\)
  - Number of students using the computer lab: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
  - \(135\%\) of the number of students using the computer lab: \(135\% \times 118 = 158.7 \approx 159\)

- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class:
  - Number of students using the library: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103\)
  - Number of students using the computer lab: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
  - \(135\%\) of the number of students using the computer lab: \(135\% \times 99 = 133.65 \approx 134\)
  - Since \(103 < 134\), the number of students using the library is not more than \(135\%\) of the number of students using the computer lab.

- For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class:
  - Number of students using the library: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62\)
  - Number of students using the computer lab: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
  - \(135\%\) of the number of students using the computer lab: \(135\% \times 41 = 55.35 \approx 55\)
  - Since \(62 > 55\), the number of students using the library is more than \(135\%\) of the number of students using the computer lab.

- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

The field is bounded by a straight line segment of length 400 meters and two semicircles. The total perimeter of the field is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

Let's denote the length of the straight side of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two semicircles have a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, so the radius is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The perimeter of the field is given by:
\[ L + L + \pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right) + \pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right) = 2L + \pi W \]
We know that the perimeter is 400 meters, so we can write:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the field is the area of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

The maximum area \( A \) is:

We know that \(\sin^2{R} + \cos^2{R} = 1\). Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can substitute this value into the equation to find \(\cos{R}\):

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \( y \) in the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

The solutions to \( f'(x) = 0 \) are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

The minimum distance can be expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since \( a = 10 \) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we have \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):

   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):

   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0

   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by considering the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Let the vertices of the octahedron be \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \) where \( A_i \) is opposite to \( A_{i+3} \) ( indices taken modulo 6). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

First, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant and equal to \( 4a^2 \), where \( a \) is the edge length of the octahedron. However, we can also use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices in each pair of opposite vertices is constant.

Let the distances from \( P \) to the vertices be \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6 \) where \( d_1 = 3 \), \( d_2 = 7 \), \( d_3 = 8 \), \( d_4 = 9 \), and \( d_5 = 11 \). We need to find \( d_6 \).

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices in each pair of opposite vertices is constant, we can write:
\[ d_1^2 + d_4^2 = d_2^2 + d_5^2 = d_3^2 + d_6^2 \]

First, we calculate \( d_1^2 + d_4^2 \):
\[ d_1^2 + d_4^2 = 3^2 + 9^2 = 9 + 81 = 90 \]

Next, we calculate \( d_2^2 + d_5^2 \):
\[ d_2^2 + d_5^2 = 7^2 + 11^2 = 49 + 121 = 170 \]

Since \( d_3^2 + d_6^2 \) must equal one of these sums, and it must be the same for all pairs, we see that the only consistent sum is 90. Therefore, we have:
\[ d_3^2 + d_6^2 = 90 \]

Now, we solve for \( d_6 \):
\[ 8^2 + d_6^2 = 90 \]
\[ 64 + d_6^2 = 90 \]
\[ d_6^2 = 26 \]
\[ d_6 = \sqrt{26} \]

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is \(\boxed{\sqrt{26}}\).","[sqrt(26), '\\sqrt{26}']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the tennis ball thrown by the Tzen to the acceleration of the basketball thrown by the Tzak, we start with the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force \( F \) acting on an object is equal to the mass \( m \) of the object multiplied by its acceleration \( a \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Since the force applied to both balls is the same, we can write the equations for the force on each ball as follows:

\[ F = m_{\text{tennis}} \cdot a_{\text{tennis}} \]
\[ F = m_{\text{basketball}} \cdot a_{\text{basketball}} \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_{\text{tennis}} \cdot a_{\text{tennis}} = m_{\text{basketball}} \cdot a_{\text{basketball}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls: \( m_{\text{tennis}} = 200 \) g and \( m_{\text{basketball}} = 150 \) g. To find the ratio of the accelerations, we can solve for \( a_{\text{tennis}} \) in terms of \( a_{\text{basketball}} \):

\[ a_{\text{tennis}} = \frac{m_{\text{basketball}}}{m_{\text{tennis}}} \cdot a_{\text{basketball}} \]

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ a_{\text{tennis}} = \frac{150}{200} \cdot a_{\text{basketball}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot a_{\text{basketball}} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the tennis ball to the acceleration of the basketball is:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{tennis}}}{a_{\text{basketball}}} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To determine how many of the same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

\[

### Step 3: Identify the common digits
Now, we compare the digits in the base 7 representation \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation \(1165_8\).

The digits in \(1556_7\) are: \(1, 5, 6\)

The digits in \(1165_8\) are: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are: \(1, 5, 6\)

### Step 4: Count the common digits
There are 3 common digits: \(1, 5, 6\).

"To find the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) and the sum of its coefficients, we start by substituting \( x-1 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \).

First, we expand \( f(x-1) \):
\[
f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2.
\]

We need to expand each term separately:
1. Expand \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[
(x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1.
\]
So,
\[
3(x-1)^4 = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3.
\]

2. Expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[
(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1.
\]
So,
\[
5(x-1)^2 = 5x^2 - 10x + 5.
\]

3. Expand \( -9(x-1) \):
\[
-9(x-1) = -9x + 9.
\]

Now, we combine all these expanded terms:
\[
f(x-1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2.
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
f(x-1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15.
\]

The polynomial \( g(x) \) is \( 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15 \). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is \( a_n + a_{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0 \). For the polynomial \( g(x) \), the sum of the coefficients is:
\[

"To find the minimum distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. That is,
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

From Vieta's formulas, we know that
\[

\]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can express \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Notice that
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).

Expanding this product, we get

\]

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and can be paired in such a way that the expressions \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of a cubic polynomial whose coefficients are symmetric functions of the roots of the original polynomial. By symmetry and the fact that the sum of the roots is zero, the roots of this cubic polynomial must be \(2, -1, -1\). Therefore, the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are \(2, -1, -1\).

Thus, the non-ordered set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\boxed{\{-1, -1, 2\}}\).","[{-1, 2}, '\\{-1, -1, 2\\}']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],False

- Let \( m \) be the cost of one marble.
- Let \( g \) be the cost of one large piece of gum.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:

1. Three marbles and one large piece of gum cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3m + g = 1.24
   \]

2. Five marbles and one large piece of gum cost \$1.82:

We now have a system of two equations with two variables:
\[

To eliminate \( g \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5m + g) - (3m + g) = 1.82 - 1.24

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2m = 0.58

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions defined by these conditions.

First, let's denote the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \(ABCD\):
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

### Step 1: Define the regions of interest
We need to find the region where a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices. This means we need to solve the inequalities:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2} \]
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2} \]

### Step 2: Simplify the inequalities
Let's simplify the first inequality:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \]
\[ ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

Similarly, we can simplify the other inequalities:
\[ ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ -ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ -ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

### Step 3: Interpret the inequalities geometrically
These inequalities define a region inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) that is bounded by the lines:
\[ ax - by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ ax + by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ -ax + by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ -ax - by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

These lines form a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths proportional to the side lengths of the original rectangle.

### Step 4: Calculate the area of the smaller rectangle
The side lengths of the smaller rectangle are:
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} \]

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \right) \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} \right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the area of the original rectangle
The area of the original rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{original}} = 4ab \]

### Step 6: Calculate the probability
The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we add the values of the three terms together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):
- The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]
- The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum is:
  \[
  3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]
- The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top right to the bottom left contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 5 + 2 = 15
  \]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many fewer steps the Τζιμ takes compared to the Μάρθα, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance the Τζιμ travels. The Τζιμ perches diagonally across the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ steps}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance the Μάρθα travels. The Μάρθα perches at the same point as the Τζιμ, but she travels along the perimeter of the field. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ steps}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the Τζιμ and the Μάρθα:
\[
\text{Difference} = 1400 - 500 = 900 \text{ steps}
\]

Therefore, the Τζιμ takes \(\boxed{900}\) fewer steps than the Μάρθα.","[900, '900']",200,"[200, '200']",False

"To determine the minimum distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the shortest possible route.

Let's denote the distances between the points as follows:
- \(AB = d_{AB}\)
- \(AC = d_{AC}\)
- \(AD = d_{AD}\)
- \(BC = d_{BC}\)
- \(BD = d_{BD}\)
- \(CD = d_{CD}\)

The problem is to find the minimum perimeter of a triangle formed by any three of these points, since the fourth point will be the starting and ending point, and the distance to and from this point will be zero in the context of the perimeter of the triangle formed by the other three points.

The minimum distance will be the perimeter of the triangle with the smallest perimeter. Therefore, we need to compare the perimeters of the triangles \(ABC\), \(ABD\), \(ACD\), and \(BCD\).

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA}\]

The perimeter of triangle \(ABD\) is:
\[d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{DA}\]

The perimeter of triangle \(ACD\) is:
\[d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}\]

The perimeter of triangle \(BCD\) is:
\[d_{BC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB}\]

The minimum of these four perimeters will be the minimum distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points and visiting the other three points exactly once.

Thus, the minimum distance is:
\[\boxed{\min(d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA}, d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{DA}, d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}, d_{BC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB})}\]","[Min(d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA}, d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{DA}, d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}, d_{BC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB}), '\\min(d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA}, d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{DA}, d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}, d_{BC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB})']",13,"[13, '13']",False
