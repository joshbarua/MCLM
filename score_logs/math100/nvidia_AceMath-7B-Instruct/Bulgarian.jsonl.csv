"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \),
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{6i}{2} + i^2 \frac{6i}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots to simplify it.

Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 242.
- Start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
  \[
  242 \div 2 = 121
  \]
  So, 242 can be written as \(2 \times 121\).
- Next, find the prime factorization of 121. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. Check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check the next prime number, which is 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check the next prime number, which is 7. Perform the division:
  \[
  121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]
  So, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check the next prime number, which is 11. Perform the division:
  \[
  121 \div 11 = 11
  \]
  So, 121 can be written as \(11 \times 11\).
- Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
  \[
  242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
  \]

Step 2: Use the prime factorization to simplify the square root.
- The square root of a product is the product of the square roots:
  \[
  \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
  \]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Next, we calculate \((10x^3)^2\):

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]

Then, we calculate \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

Here are the steps to find the answer:

1. Identify the total degrees in a full rotation: \(360^\circ\).
2. Determine the number of sides of the pentagon: 5.
3. Calculate the angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself by dividing the full rotation by the number of sides: \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the diagonals bisect each other, these midpoints must be the same. Therefore, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:

\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. If we assume \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(B\), then the diagonals would be \(AB\) and \(CD\), and the midpoints would be equal.

The midpoint of diagonal \(AB\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of diagonal \(CD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]
Setting these midpoints equal gives:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:

\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4

\[
4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid.

The correct arrangement is that \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(C\), then the diagonals would be \(AC\) and \(BD\), and the midpoints would be equal. The correct solution is:

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine.

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
   \[
   f(7) = \frac{2 \cdot 7}{7^2 - 5 \cdot 7 - 14} = \frac{14}{49 - 35 - 14} = \frac{14}{0} \quad \text{(undefined)}

   \[

   \]
   Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials of degrees \( n \) and \( m \) respectively, depends on the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \):
   - If \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
   - If \( n = m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \).
   - If \( n > m \), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).
   For the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator \( n \) is 1 and the degree of the denominator \( m \) is 2. Since \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[

Thus, we have:

\[

"To compute \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\)**.
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)**.
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\)**.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]
Now, summing these values:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]
Thus, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]
Now, summing these values:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]
Thus, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now we subtract the two base \(10\) values:
\[
53 - 17 = 36
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
1. \(36 \div 9 = 4\) with a remainder of \(0\).
2. \(4 \div 9 = 0\) with a remainder of \(4\).

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we find that \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"Let's denote the weight of a trika as \( T \), the weight of a scuig as \( S \), and the weight of a guli as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( 13T = 3S + G \) (Equation 1)
2. \( 2T + G = S \) (Equation 2)

We need to find the weight of a certain number of trijka that equals the weight of one scuig.

First, we can rearrange Equation 2 to express \( G \) in terms of \( T \) and \( S \):

\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( G \) into Equation 1:

\[
13T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
13T = 4S - 2T
\]

Now, we can add \( 2T \) to both sides:

\[
15T = 4S
\]

Next, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( T \):

\[
S = \frac{15T}{4}
\]

Now, we want to find how many trijka weigh the same as one scuig. Let \( n \) be the number of trijka that equals the weight of one scuig:

\[
nT = S
\]

Substituting the expression for \( S \):

\[
nT = \frac{15T}{4}
\]

Now, we can divide both sides by \( T \) (assuming \( T \neq 0 \)):

\[
n = \frac{15}{4}
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we can conclude that \( n = 3.75 \) trijka weigh the same as one scuig. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a trika, we can express the answer in terms of whole trijka.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3.75}

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

   This matches.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), so we have:
   \[

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) does not have a minimum value but it does have a maximum value of \(0\) as \(x \to \infty\).

Next, consider the case \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) is increasing and its value as \(x \to -\infty\) is \(-\infty\). If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x)\) is decreasing and its value as \(x \to -\infty\) is \(\infty\).

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of \(f(x)\) in both cases. For \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\) and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2)\). For \(a < 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \((-\infty, 0]\) and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((\infty, a^2)\).

For \(a > 0\), the combined range of \(f(x)\) is \((-\infty, a^2) \cup [a^3, \infty)\). For \(a < 0\), the combined range of \(f(x)\) is \((-\infty, 0] \cup (\infty, a^2)\), which is not the entire set of real numbers.

Therefore, we need \(a^2 \geq a^3\) for \(a > 0\). This inequality simplifies to \(a^2(1 - a) \geq 0\), which holds for \(0 < a \leq 1\). The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this inequality is \(a = 1\).

For \(a = 1\), the function is:
\[ f(x) =

x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 1, \\
x + 2 & \text{if } x < 1.

The range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq 1\) is \([1, \infty)\) and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < 1\) is \((-\infty, 3)\). The combined range is \((-\infty, 3) \cup [1, \infty) = \mathbb{R}\), which means the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once.

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This inequality holds if and only if \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\), so \(y\) is a fixed point of \(f\). From the previous step, we know that the fixed points of \(f\) are \(0\) and \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (for \(\lambda \geq 1\)).

Since \(f(x) \neq x\), \(y\) cannot be equal to \(x\). Therefore, \(y\) must be the other fixed point. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. \(f(x) = 0\)
2. \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (for \(\lambda \geq 1\))

**Case 1: \(f(x) = 0\)**

If \(f(x) = 0\), then:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = 0.
\]
This equation has solutions \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\). However, if \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), then \(f(x) = x\), which contradicts the condition \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

**Case 2: \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (for \(\lambda \geq 1\))**

If \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x) = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
\[
\Delta = (-\lambda^2)^2 - 4(\lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) = \lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2 = \lambda^2(\lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 4) = \lambda^2(\lambda - 2)^2.
\]
For the quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative, which is always true since \(\lambda^2 \geq 0\) and \((\lambda - 2)^2 \geq 0\). Therefore, the quadratic equation always has real solutions.

We need to check if these solutions lie in the interval \([0,1]\). The solutions are:
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda(\lambda - 2)}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda \pm (\lambda - 2)}{2\lambda}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = \frac{2\lambda - 2}{2\lambda} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{2}{2\lambda} = \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This inequality holds if and only if \(\lambda \geq 1\).

For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This inequality holds if and only if \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Therefore, the solutions \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) and \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\) are both in the interval \([0,1]\) for \(\lambda \geq 1\). However, we need to ensure that \(f(x) \neq x\). For \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\):
\[
f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\):
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda} \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
Therefore, both solutions satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\).

Thus, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are \(\lambda \geq 1\). The final answer is:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan(A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to identify \(\theta\). Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we can rewrite it as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
This matches the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 35^\circ\):
\[
\tan 35^\circ = \frac{\tan 65^\circ + \tan 5^\circ}{1 - \tan 65^\circ \tan 5^\circ}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8

   This means there are 8 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40).

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

\[
f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle formed by the points \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

Given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and using properties of medians and centroids in a triangle.

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Determine the area of triangle \( AGC \):**
   Since \( G \) divides the median \( CF \) in the ratio 2:1, the area of triangle \( AGC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \). This is because the triangles \( AGC \) and \( BGC \) have the same height from \( C \) to \( AB \), and the base \( AG \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of \( AD \), which is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of \( AB \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( AGC \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AGC = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{2}{3} \times 144 = 96
   \]

3. **Determine the area of triangle \( ENG \):**
   The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar with a similarity ratio equal to the ratio of the distances from \( A \) to \( M \) and \( A \) to \( B \), which is the same as the ratio of \( AG \) to \( AD \), i.e., \( \frac{2}{3} \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64

   Since \( G \) divides \( MN \) in the ratio 2:1, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the area of triangle \( AMN \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{1}{3} \times 64 = \frac{64}{3}

"Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic progression as \( a \) and the common difference as \( d \).

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic progression is given by:

\[
a_n = a + (n - 1)d

We know the values of the fourth term and the eighth term:

1. The fourth term \( a_4 = 200 \):
   \[

2. The eighth term \( a_8 = 500 \):
   \[
   a + 7d = 500 \quad \text{(2)}

Now, we can set up a system of equations using equations (1) and (2):

From equation (1):
\[
a = 200 - 3d

Substituting \( a \) from equation (1) into equation (2):
\[

- First term \( a = -25 \)
- Common difference \( d = 75 \)

Substituting the values of \( a \) and \( d \):
\[
a_6 = -25 + 5(75) = -25 + 375 = 350

To find the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Pol and Jesse is even, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the numbers chosen.

1. **Identify the parity of the prime numbers:**
   - 2 is even.
   - 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are all odd.

2. **Determine the combinations that yield an even sum:**
   - The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.

"To determine the number of sides of a concave polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon be \(S\). Since the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), the sum of all the interior angles \(S\) is:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   where \(x\) is the measure of the excluded interior angle.

2. **Determine the range of the excluded angle:**
   The measure of an interior angle of a polygon must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the excluded angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < x < 180^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the sum of the interior angles in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of the interior angles, we have:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Substituting \(S = 1070^\circ + x\) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x

4. **Find the range for \(n\):**
   Since \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Dividing the entire inequality by \(180^\circ\), we get:
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}

   Simplifying the fractions, we have:

   \]
   Adding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444

   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8.

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence equation:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have two candidates: \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). The odd one is \( t = 17 \).

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula:

\[

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).

Simplifying the components, we get:

Now, we find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
   The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

2. **Determine the range of \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates for the interior points:**

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   Since the points are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, the order in which we list the points does not matter. Therefore, we can consider the points as being fixed in some order around the circle.

2. **Determine the condition for the segments to intersect:**
   The segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we list the points in one possible order, say \(A, C, B, D\), then the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect. Any other arrangement where the points are not in an alternating pattern will result in the segments not intersecting.

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements:**
   There are \(4!\) (24) possible ways to arrange the four points in a specific order. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points. This gives us \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange the points relative to \(A\). Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in an alternating pattern (e.g., \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\)). Therefore, there are 2 favorable arrangements for each fixed point \(A\).

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there are 2 favorable arrangements out of 6 possible arrangements, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The radius of the smaller circle is 1, so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The total area of the two circles is:
\[
4\pi + \pi = 5\pi
\]
The common area of the two circles is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the common area is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The common area consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The sum of these areas is the common area:
\[
2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}

We set this equal to the common area we calculated earlier:
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

Solving for \(\theta\), we get:
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}

To convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees, we use the fact that \(\pi\) radians is 180 degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 120^\circ

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senate commission consisting of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members without any restrictions.**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 + 6) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans.**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):

"To find the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[

\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \) and keep \( x = 66 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties and trigonometric identities.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \).
   - The height \( AM = 11 \).
   - Point \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

2. **Define the angles:**
   - Let \( \angle BAC = 2\theta \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta \).

3. **Use the tangent function:**
   - In \( \triangle AMB \), \( \tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11} \). Therefore, \( BM = 11 \tan \theta \).
   - Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BC = 2BM = 22 \tan \theta \).

4. **Analyze \( \triangle BDC \):**
   - \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \), so \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).
   - Let \( \angle BAC = 2\theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC = 6\theta \).

5. **Use the tangent function in \( \triangle BDC \):**
   - In \( \triangle BDC \), \( \tan 6\theta = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot DM} = \frac{22 \tan \theta}{2 \cdot 1} = 11 \tan \theta \).

6. **Use the triple angle identity for tangent:**
   - The triple angle identity for tangent is \( \tan 3x = \frac{3 \tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3 \tan^2 x} \). Since \( \angle BDC = 6\theta = 3 \cdot 2\theta \), we have \( \tan 6\theta = \frac{3 \tan 2\theta - \tan^3 2\theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 2\theta} \).
   - However, we can use the fact that \( \tan 6\theta = 11 \tan \theta \) directly to find \( \theta \).

7. **Solve for \( \theta \):**
   - Using the identity \( \tan 3x = \frac{3 \tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3 \tan^2 x} \) and the fact that \( \tan 6\theta = 11 \tan \theta \), we can solve for \( \theta \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \tan 6\theta = 11 \tan \theta \) directly to find \( \theta \).

   - Once we have \( \theta \), we can find \( \tan \theta \) and then \( BM \) and \( BC \).
   - The sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) are equal and can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AMB \).

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

The sum of 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as the product of the number of integers and the average of these integers. Let the first integer be \(a\). Then the 27 consecutive integers are \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\). The sum of these integers is:

\[
a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\), the last term \(a+26\), and the number of terms 27. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]

We know that the sum is 2187, so we set up the equation:

\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187

Solving for \(a\), we divide both sides by 27:

\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:

a = 68

The 27 consecutive integers are therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. Counting to the 14th term, we have:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, 3)\). So, we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, define \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[-4 < y^2 + 4y.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The root of the equation \((y + 2)^2 = 0\) is \(y = -2\). This root divides the real number line into two intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\) and \((-2, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -2)\), choose \(y = -3\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-3 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((- \infty, -2)\).

2. For \(y \in (-2, \infty)\), choose \(y = -1\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-1 + 2)^2 = (1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-2, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) is \((-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, \infty)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, \infty)\).

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Thus, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

1. Calculate the number of boys traveling by bus for each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls traveling by bus for each class.
3. Determine the ratio of the number of boys traveling by bus to the number of girls traveling by bus for each class.
4. Find the class for which this ratio is closest to \(135\%\).

Let's start with the calculations:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of boys traveling by bus for each class
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\) boys.
- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103\) boys.
- For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62\) boys.
- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35\) boys.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of girls traveling by bus for each class
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118\) girls.
- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\) girls.
- For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\) girls.
- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26\) girls.

### Step 3: Determine the ratio of the number of boys traveling by bus to the number of girls traveling by bus for each class
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class: \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.0424\).
- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.0404\).
- For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class: \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.5122\).
- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.3462\).

### Step 4: Find the class for which this ratio is closest to \(135\%\)
- \(135\% = 1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.0424\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.0404\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class is \(1.5122\).

The ratio closest to \(1.35\) is \(1.3462\), which corresponds to the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero.

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the denominator in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends, forming a complete circuit of 400 meters. Let's denote the length of the rectangular field by \( L \) meters and the width by \( W \) meters. The two semicircular ends together form a full circle with a radius of \( \frac{W}{2} \) meters.

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle:
\[
2L + 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = 400
\]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we have:
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right) = 200 - 100 = 100
\]

The area of the rectangular field is:
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron and the given distances from point \( P \) to five of its vertices. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to all six vertices is constant and equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahed2 to all six vertices.

First, let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \). The distances from point \( P \) to these vertices are given as follows:
\[ PA_1 = 3, \quad PA_2 = 7, \quad PA_3 = 8, \quad PA_4 = 9, \quad PA_5 = 11. \]
We need to find the distance \( PA_6 \).

The sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant. For a regular octahedron with side length \( a \), the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to all six vertices is \( 6a^2 \). However, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to all six vertices.

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to \( A_6 \) as \( x \). Then, we have:
\[ PA_1^2 + PA_2^2 + PA_3^2 + PA_4^2 + PA_5^2 + PA_6^2 = \text{constant}. \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to all six vertices is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to all six vertices. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}. \]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[ 3^2 = 9, \]
\[ 7^2 = 49, \]
\[ 8^2 = 64, \]
\[ 9^2 = 81, \]
\[ 11^2 = 121. \]

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324. \]

So, we have:
\[ 324 + x^2 = \text{constant}. \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant, we can conclude that:
\[ x^2 = \text{constant} - 324. \]

To find the constant, we need to know the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to all six vertices, but we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to all six vertices. Therefore, we can write:
\[ x^2 = 324. \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ x = \sqrt{324} = 18. \]

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine how many digits are common between the representations of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder } 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder } 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder } 5

\[

\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get:

\[

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder } 5
\]
\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get:

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the two representations

Now we compare the digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):

- Digits in \(1556_7\): \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Digits in \(1165_8\): \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

Each thingy shakes hands with each magyosnic, but no thingy shakes hands with another thingy, and no magyosnic shakes hands with another magyosnic.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the number of thingies and magyosnics:
   - There are 6 thingies.
   - There are 10 magyosnics.

2. Determine the number of handshakes between each thingy and each magyosnic:
   - Each of the 6 thingies shakes hands with each of the 10 magyosnics.
   - Therefore, the total number of handshakes is \(6 \times 10 = 60\).

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[

\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This gives us:

\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[

\]
\[

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:

\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

We know that the sum of these expressions is equal to the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[

Next, we need to find the product of these expressions. We use the identity for the product of sums of products of roots:
\[
S_1S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).

Expanding this product, we get:

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1S_2S_3 = 16\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t - 16 = 0\), which simplifies to \(t^3 - 16 = 0\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Assume \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

We need to find the region where \(d_O < d_A\). Squaring both sides of the inequality, we get:

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2

\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2

This inequality represents a line that divides the plane into two regions. The region below this line (where \(ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)) is closer to \(O\) than to \(A\).

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other vertices:
- For \(B = (a, b)\): \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For \(C = (a, -b)\): \(ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For \(D = (-a, -b)\): \(ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

These four lines intersect at the center \(O\) and form a smaller rectangle inside \(ABCD\). The vertices of this smaller rectangle are the points where the lines intersect the sides of the original rectangle.

The side lengths of the smaller rectangle can be found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines with the sides of the original rectangle. However, a simpler approach is to note that the smaller rectangle is similar to the original rectangle and has a side ratio of \(1:1\).

Since the original rectangle has a side ratio of \(k = \frac{AB}{AD}\), the smaller rectangle will have a side ratio of \(\frac{1}{k}\). The area of the smaller rectangle is:

- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:

This means that 126 dollars can be obtained, which is equivalent to:

\[
126 \text{ dollars} = 126 \times 100 = 12600 \text{ cents}
\]

To find out how many cents remain after exchanging as many as possible into dollars, we subtract the number of cents exchanged from the total number of cents:

\[
12659 - 12600 = 59 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money that remains is \(\boxed{59}\) cents.","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score (arithmetic mean) of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score for all the students:
- 20 students received a score of 80. So, the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- 8 students received a score of 90. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students received a score of 100. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these scores to get the total score for the entire class:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students in the class, which is 30:
\[\frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

Therefore, the average score (arithmetic mean) of the class on this test is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):
- The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]
- The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum is:
  \[
  3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]
- The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The other main diagonal contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n+1 = 8 \). The sum is:
  \[
  2 + 5 + 8 = 15
  \]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less James travels compared to Marta, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Marta travels. Marta walks the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Marta travels} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance James travels. James walks along the diagonal of the field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field). Therefore, the length of the diagonal is:
\[
\text{Distance James travels} = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Marta travels and the distance James travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, James travels \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Marta.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True

   - \(C \to D \to A \to B\): \(CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
   - \(C \to D \to B \to A\): \(CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\)
   The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is \(13\).

   - \(D \to A \to B \to C\): \(DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
