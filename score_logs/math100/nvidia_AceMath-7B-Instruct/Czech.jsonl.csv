"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DE\).

Given:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}
\]
we can substitute the known values:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]

To solve for \(DE\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(DE\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DE = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{7}{0.7}\), we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 10:
\[
DE = \frac{7 \cdot 10}{0.7 \cdot 10} = \frac{70}{7} = 10
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6i\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{6i^2\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}) = 1 + 3\sqrt{2} + (1 - 3\sqrt{2})i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (1 + 3\sqrt{2} + (1 - 3\sqrt{2})i) + (2 - 3i) = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} + (1 - 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} + (-2 - 3\sqrt{2})i.
   \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{3 + 3\sqrt{2} + (-2 - 3\sqrt{2})i}\).","[i*(-1*3*sqrt(2) - 2) + 3 + 3*sqrt(2), '3 + 3\\sqrt{2} + (-2 - 3\\sqrt{2})i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",False
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]
\[121 \div 11 = 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is \(2 \times 11 \times 11\). We can rewrite the square root of 242 as:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}\]

Using the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\), we can simplify this to:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange in a circle, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

"To determine the minimum number of degrees by which a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

1. Identify the total degrees in a full rotation: \(360^\circ\).
2. Determine the number of sides of the pentagon: \(5\).
3. Calculate the minimum angle of rotation by dividing the total degrees by the number of sides: \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the other possible diagonal, which connects \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\).

The midpoint of this diagonal is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid. The correct approach is to consider the other possible diagonal, which connects \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\).

The correct solution is to consider the other possible diagonal, which connects \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

The midpoint of this diagonal is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in my head, I can break it down into simpler steps.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Now we can combine the fractions:

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case \(x \geq a\):
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). If \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

Next, consider the case \(x < a\):

This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) is increasing and its value as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) is \(-\infty\). If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x)\) is decreasing and its value as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) is \(\infty\).

For the graph of \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the function must cover all real values. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(\infty\). Therefore, the function covers all real values greater than or equal to \(a^3\). To ensure that the function intersects every horizontal line, \(a^3\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\), which is \(\infty\). This condition is always satisfied for \(a > 0\).

If \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(-\infty\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda > 1\)).

Next, we need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's start by expressing \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 = 1 \implies -\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it is not a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find the other roots of the cubic equation that are in the interval \([0,1]\) and are not equal to the fixed points.

By inspection or using numerical methods, we can find that for \(\lambda = 2\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
-8x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0.
\]
One of the roots of this equation is \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), which is in the interval \([0,1]\) and is not a fixed point of \(f\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 2\) is a solution.

For other values of \(\lambda\), the cubic equation does not have any other roots in the interval \([0,1]\) that are not fixed points of \(f\). Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 2\).

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this, we use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[

We can use the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 40^\circ\):
\[
\tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\cos 40^\circ} = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[

Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[

\[

Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[

\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Equating this to the given expression, we get:

Thus,

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This can be derived using the multiple-angle formula for cosine.

According to the problem, Hillary has a total of eleven coins, so we can write the first equation as:

- Pravděpodobnost, že oba vyberou liché: \( P(\text{lichý, lichý}) = \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36} \)

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0 and 1, we need to consider the properties of the number 450. The number 450 can be factored as \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\). Therefore, any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0 or 1. Since we are looking for a number whose digits are only 0 and 1, the last digit must be 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00 or 25. Since the digits can only be 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Therefore, the sum of the digits of our number must be a multiple of 9.

Given these conditions, the number must end in 00 and the sum of its digits (which are all 1s) must be a multiple of 9. The smallest such number is 11111111100, because it has 9 ones, and 9 is divisible by 9.

Let's verify:
- The number 11111111100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
- The sum of the digits of 11111111100 is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\), which is divisible by 9.
- Therefore, 11111111100 is divisible by 9.

Since 11111111100 is divisible by 2, 9, and 25, it is divisible by 450.

Thus, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0 and 1 is \(\boxed{11111111100}\).","[11111111100, '11111111100']","11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","[100, '100']",False
"To determine the probability that the figurka is placed on a shaded square of the chessboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - The first number (from the first rotation) can be any of the 4 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), which determines the column.
   - The second number (from the second rotation) can be any of the 5 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which determines the row.
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - A chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, making a total of 64 squares.
   - Half of these squares are shaded, so there are \(64 / 2 = 32\) shaded squares.
   - We need to determine how many of these 32 shaded squares can be reached by the given method of determining the column and row.
   - Since the column is determined by a number from 1 to 4 and the row is determined by a number from 1 to 5, the possible positions on the chessboard are limited to the first 4 columns and the first 5 rows. This gives us a \(4 \times 5 = 20\) possible positions.
   - Out of these 20 possible positions, half are shaded (since the chessboard pattern alternates and the first row and column are both half shaded). Therefore, there are \(20 / 2 = 10\) shaded squares among these 20 possible positions.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}\).

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use properties of the sine function and symmetry. First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x)\) can be simplified as follows:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Let \(x = 20^\circ\), then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, we have:

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the total sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < x < 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Find the possible values for \(n\):**
   We need to find \(n\) such that the equation \((n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x\) holds true for some \(x\) in the range \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\). First, let's find the range for \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide the entire inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Since \(n-2\) must be an integer, the only possible value is \(6\). Therefore:
   \[
   n-2 = 6 \implies n = 8
   \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   The missing angle \(x\) is:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(0^\circ < 10^\circ < 180^\circ\), the solution is valid.

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the congruence:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

"To find the value of the operation \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we use the definition of the operation @, which is given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. The key insight is that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the order of selection does not matter, we can fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in the remaining positions. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the points, which is \(6\) ways.

Next, we need to count the number of these arrangements where the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, this happens if the points are in an alternating pattern. For a fixed point \(A\), the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be arranged in the following alternating patterns:
1. \(A, C, B, D\)
2. \(A, D, B, C\)
3. \(A, B, D, C\)
4. \(A, C, D, B\)
5. \(A, D, C, B\)
6. \(A, B, C, D\)

However, only the first two patterns result in intersecting line segments. Therefore, there are \(2\) favorable arrangements for each fixed point \(A\).

Since there are \(4\) points and we can fix any one of them, the total number of favorable arrangements is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements. Thus, the probability is:
\[
\frac{8}{24} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True

"To determine how many cylindrical containers are needed to fill a spherical container, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical and spherical containers and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical container to the volume of one cylindrical container.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical container, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical container, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical containers are required to fill the spherical container. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical container by the volume of one cylindrical container:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical containers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a senatorial committee consisting of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

"To find the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[

\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\), we need to find the perimeter of the triangle given that \(D\) is a point on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), the triangle is isosceles, and the base angles are equal. Therefore, \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\).

Given that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), we can use the fact that \(D\) is on the altitude \(AM\). The point \(D\) divides \(AM\) into segments \(AD = 10\) and \(DM = 1\).

We can use the tangent function to express the sides of the triangle in terms of \(\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we have \(BM = MC = \frac{BC}{2}\). Using the right triangle \(ABM\), we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11} \implies BM = 11 \tan \theta \implies BC = 22 \tan \theta.
\]
The length of \(AB\) (and \(AC\)) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + (11 \tan \theta)^2} = 11 \sqrt{1 + \tan^2 \theta} = 11 \sec \theta.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). The tangent of \(\angle BDC\) can be expressed using the tangent addition formula for the angles \(\angle BDM\) and \(\angle MDC\):
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \tan (3\theta) = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}.
\]
However, we can also express \(\tan \angle BDC\) using the right triangle \(BDC\):
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot DM} = \frac{22 \tan \theta}{2 \cdot 1} = 11 \tan \theta.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\tan \angle BDC\), we get:
\[
11 \tan \theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}.
\]
Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:
\[
11 \tan \theta (1 - 3\tan^2 \theta) = 3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta \implies 11 - 33\tan^2 \theta = 3 - \tan^2 \theta \implies 8 = 32 \tan^2 \theta \implies \tan^2 \theta = \frac{1}{4} \implies \tan \theta = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Thus, \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\). Therefore, \(\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\).

The length of \(AB\) (and \(AC\)) is:

AB = 11 \sec \theta = 11 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}.

The perimeter of the triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To find the median of the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers that equals \(3^7\), we start by expressing the sum of these integers in a general form. Let the first integer be \(n\). Then the 27 consecutive integers are \(n, n+1, n+2, \ldots, n+26\).

The sum of these 27 integers can be calculated as:
\[
n + (n+1) + (n+2) + \cdots + (n+26)
\]
This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(n\), the last term \(n+26\), and the number of terms 27. The sum \(S\) of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[
S = \frac{\text{number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[
S = \frac{27}{2} \times (n + (n+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2n + 26) = 27 \times (n + 13)
\]
We know that the sum is equal to \(3^7\). Therefore, we have:
\[
27 \times (n + 13) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 \times (n + 13) = 3^7

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, 3)\). Thus, the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Since \(x^4 \geq 0\) and \(4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative and its minimum value is 0, which occurs when \(x = 0\). Therefore, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of male students traveling by bus for each ročník
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) ročník: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3\)
- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) ročník: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2\)
- For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) ročník: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 61.8\)
- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) ročník: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 34.8\)

### Step 2: Calculate the number of female students traveling by bus for each ročník

- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) ročník: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3\)

- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) ročník: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8\)

### Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the number of male students traveling by bus to the number of female students traveling by bus for each ročník
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) ročník: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.044\)

- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) ročník: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.344\)

### Step 4: Determine which ratio is closest to \(135\%\)
- \(135\% = 1.35\)
- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{th}}\) ročník is \(1.044\), which is \(1.35 - 1.044 = 0.306\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{th}}\) ročník is \(1.04\), which is \(1.35 - 1.04 = 0.31\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{th}}\) ročník is \(1.5\), which is \(1.5 - 1.35 = 0.15\) away from \(1.35\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = (200 - \pi W)W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \pi W^2
\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( W \), and it represents a downward-opening parabola. The maximum area occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which can be found using the vertex formula for a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where the vertex occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -\pi \) and \( b = 200 \), so:
\[
W = -\frac{200}{2(-\pi)} = \frac{200}{2\pi} = \frac{100}{\pi}
\]
Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{100}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 100 = 100
\]
The area of the rectangle is then:
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{100}{\pi} = \frac{10000}{\pi}
\]
Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To determine the value of \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\).

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle{R}\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\), then \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(RS\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
(5k)^2 = RS^2 + (2k)^2
\]
\[
25k^2 = RS^2 + 4k^2
\]
\[
21k^2 = RS^2
\]
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}k
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of \(\angle{T}\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle{T}\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}k}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

The answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by analyzing the given distances and the properties of the regular octahedron.

A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and the distances from any point \( P \) to the vertices can be paired such that the sum of the distances to each pair of opposite vertices is constant. This is because the octahedron is symmetric and the vertices can be paired as opposite vertices.

Given the distances from \( P \) to five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the distance to the sixth vertex as \( x \).

Since the sum of the distances from \( P \) to each pair of opposite vertices is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the distances to all six vertices is twice this constant sum. Therefore, the sum of the given distances plus the unknown distance \( x \) should be equal to twice the sum of the distances to any three pairs of opposite vertices.

First, we calculate the sum of the given distances:
\[ 3 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 11 = 38. \]

Let the sum of the distances to each pair of opposite vertices be \( S \). Then the total sum of the distances to all six vertices is \( 2S \). Since we have five distances, the sixth distance \( x \) must satisfy:
\[ 38 + x = 2S. \]

However, we don't need to find \( S \) explicitly. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the distances to each pair of opposite vertices is constant. Therefore, the sum of the distances to the five given vertices and the sixth vertex must be equal to twice the sum of the distances to any three pairs of opposite vertices.

Since the sum of the distances to each pair of opposite vertices is constant, the sum of the distances to the five given vertices and the sixth vertex must be equal to twice the sum of the distances to any three pairs of opposite vertices. This implies that the sixth distance \( x \) must be the missing value that completes the sum to a constant value.

By trial and error or by using the property of the regular octahedron, we find that the sixth distance \( x \) must be 6. This is because the sum of the distances to each pair of opposite vertices is 14, and the sum of the distances to all six vertices is 42.

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:
\[ \boxed{6}. \]","[6, '6']",\sqrt{66},[],True
"To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Given that the force applied to the softball is the same as the force applied to the baseball, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We know the masses of the softball and the baseball:
\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, which is:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \]

From the equation \( m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \), we can solve for \( a_{\text{softball}} \) in terms of \( a_{\text{baseball}} \):

\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{softball}}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Substituting the known masses into the equation, we get:

\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball is:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To determine the number of handshakes that occurred at the magical evening, we need to consider the interactions between the six witches and the ten wizards. According to the problem, each witch shakes hands with each wizard, but no witch shakes hands with another witch, and no wizard shakes hands with another wizard.

2. Determine the number of handshakes between each witch and each wizard: Each of the 6 witches shakes hands with each of the 10 wizards. Therefore, the total number of handshakes is calculated by multiplying the number of witches by the number of wizards.

The calculation is as follows:

\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can express \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2, \alpha_1\alpha_3, \alpha_1\alpha_4, \alpha_2\alpha_3, \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_3\alpha_4\). The polynomial is:

The constant term of this polynomial is the product of the roots taken six at a time, which is:
\[

The product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) is the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time, which is the coefficient of \(t^3\) in the polynomial \(t^6 + \cdots\). However, we can also use the fact that \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 + at^2 + bt + c = 0\) where \(a = 0\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = -4\).

- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\). The condition that a point \(P = (x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed as:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x \pm a)^2 + (y \pm b)^2} \]

We will consider the inequality for each vertex and find the region where all these inequalities are satisfied.

### Inequality for Vertex \(A = (-a, b)\):
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ -2ax - 2by < -a^2 - b^2 \]

### Inequality for Vertex \(C = (a, -b)\):
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \]
\[ -2ax + 2by < -a^2 - b^2 \]
\[ ax - by > \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

### Inequality for Vertex \(D = (-a, -b)\):
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 2ax + 2by < -a^2 - b^2 \]
\[ ax + by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

The region where all these inequalities are satisfied is the intersection of the regions defined by:
\[ ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ ax + by > \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ ax - by > \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ ax + by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

These inequalities describe a smaller rectangle centered at the origin with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\).

The area of the larger rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{larger rectangle}} = 4ab \]

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the larger rectangle:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
2. Identify the quotient and the remainder.

First, let's do the division:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

The quotient is 9. Now, to find the remainder, we can use the relationship between the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder, which is given by:

\[ \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder} \]

In this case, the dividend is 54, the divisor is 6, and the quotient is 9. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 54 = (6 \times 9) + \text{Remainder} \]

First, calculate \( 6 \times 9 \):

\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 54 = 54 + \text{Remainder} \]

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

"To find the arithmetic mean of the test scores in the class, we need to calculate the total sum of all the test scores and then divide that sum by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the test scores:
- 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add these total scores together to get the overall sum of the test scores:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of students in the class, which is 30:
\[\frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

Therefore, the arithmetic mean of the test scores in the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):
- The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]
- The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum is:
  \[
  3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]
- The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top right to the bottom left contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 5 + 2 = 15
  \]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many fewer steps Jim will take compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distances each of them will travel and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim jde diagonálně přes pole, so the distance he travels is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 stops and the width \(w\) is 300 stops. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ stops} \]
So, Jim travels 500 stops.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha se dostane na stejné místo tím, že jde podél jeho délky a šířky, so the distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Distance Martha travels} = l + w = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ stops} \]
So, Martha travels 700 stops.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ stops} \]
Therefore, Jim will take \(\boxed{200}\) fewer steps than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the minimum total distance for each starting point.
