"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) and \( c \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.**
2. **Rotate the translated \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise.**
3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.**

Let's start with the given complex numbers:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

### Step 1: Translate \( z \) and \( c \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.
First, we find the difference between \( z \) and \( c \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

### Step 2: Rotate the translated \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise.
To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) counterclockwise, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} - 3i \frac{2}{2} - 3i^2 \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

### Step 3: Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.
Now, we add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:
\[ w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosalina, and Thomas) sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the 3 specific people as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosalina, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the single block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units in a circle**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the 3 people within their unit**: Now, we need to arrange Pierre, Rosalina, and Thomas within their block. The number of ways to arrange 3 people in a line is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units in a circle by the number of ways to arrange the 3 people within their unit. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosalina, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For this term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
5k = 15 \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We know that \(\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10\), so the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True

"To find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
   \[
   \text{At } x = 7, \quad 2x = 2(7) = 14 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   \[
   \text{At } x = -2, \quad 2x = 2(-2) = -4 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).
   In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"To perform the subtraction \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10

The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\]

The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}\]

### Step 2: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}\]

### Step 3: Convert the result back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the weight of the tricks in terms of the weight of the squares and the geese.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one trick.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one square.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goose.

From the first piece of information, ""The weight of ten tricks is equal to the weight of three squares and one goose,"" we can write the equation:
\[ 10T = 3S + G \]

From the second piece of information, ""The weight of two tricks and one goose is equal to the weight of one square,"" we can write the equation:
\[ 2T + G = S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( 10T = 3S + G \)
2. \( 2T + G = S \)

We can eliminate \( G \) by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
\[ (10T - (2T + G)) = (3S + G - S) \]
\[ 8T - G = 2S + G \]
\[ 8T - 2G = 2S \]
\[ 4T - G = S \]

Now we have a new equation:
\[ S = 4T - G \]

We can substitute this expression for \( S \) back into the second original equation:
\[ 2T + G = 4T - G \]
\[ 2G = 2T \]
\[ G = T \]

Now that we know \( G = T \), we can substitute \( G \) with \( T \) in the expression for \( S \):
\[ S = 4T - T \]
\[ S = 3T \]

So, the weight of one square is \( 3T \). We need to find how many tricks have a combined weight equal to the weight of one square. Since one square weighs \( 3T \), the number of tricks that have a combined weight equal to the weight of one square is:
\[ \frac{3T}{T} = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of tricks whose combined weight is equal to the weight of one square is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form should match the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
We distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We know this must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):
1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\):
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\):
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\):
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

   This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) defined as follows:

\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the two pieces of the function separately.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).
   - If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on \(x \geq a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
   - If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) is decreasing and can take any value from \(-\infty\) to \(a^3\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).
   - If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is increasing and can take any value from \(-\infty\) to \(\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).
   - If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is decreasing and can take any value from \(\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a^2 + 2a\) to \(\infty\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must be all real numbers. This means that the range of the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) and the range of the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) must together cover all real numbers.

- If \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x) = ax^2\) is \([a^3, \infty)\) and the range of \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For these two ranges to cover all real numbers, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\). Solving this inequality:
  \[
  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \implies a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0.
  \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \in [-1, 0] \cup [2, \infty)\). Since \(a > 0\), we have \(a \in [2, \infty)\). The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(\infty\), but we need to check the other case to ensure it is the largest possible finite value.

- If \(a < 0\), the range of \(f(x) = ax^2\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\) and the range of \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is \([a^2 + 2a, \infty)\). For these two ranges to cover all real numbers, we need \(a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a\). Solving this inequality:
  \[
  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0 \implies a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0.
  \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]\). Since \(a < 0\), we have \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\). The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(-1\).

Comparing the largest values from both cases, we see that the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the value of \( c \) for which the radius of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) is 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) for some \(x \in [0,1]\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This inequality holds if \(1 \leq \lambda \leq 4\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\), so \(y\) is also a fixed point of \(f\) or \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). Since \(f(x) \neq x\), \(y \neq x\). Therefore, \(y\) must be the other fixed point, which is \(0\) or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

If \(y = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\), which implies \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\). But \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f(1) = 0\), so \(f(f(0)) = 0\) and \(f(f(1)) = 0\). This does not satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\) unless \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\), which is not a valid solution since \(f(x) \neq x\).

If \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). We need to solve:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x) = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.

The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be positive for there to be two distinct solutions \(x\):

\Delta = (-\lambda^2)^2 - 4(\lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) = \lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2 = \lambda^2(\lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 4) = \lambda^2(\lambda - 2)^2.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan(A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to simplify this expression. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we get:
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
The angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) and \(\theta\) is the minimum positive angle is:
\[
\theta = 120^\circ.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we first need to identify the letters and their frequencies. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Here, the letter E appears twice and the letter L appears twice.

The formula to calculate the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{5040}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   This means there are 8 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40).

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
   This means there is 1 multiple of 25 (25).

3. Count the multiples of 125 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
   This means there are no multiples of 125 in this range.

Since higher powers of 5 will also contribute factors of 5, but there are no such multiples in the range from 1 to 42, we stop here.

Adding up all the factors of 5, we get:
\[
8 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product, i.e., \(\frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v}\|\).

Here, \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}

Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
So, the cross product is \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[

First, we note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[

\[

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the condition:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This can be expanded and rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have two candidates: \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). The odd one is \( t = 17 \).

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube in square inches given that its volume is 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the volume in cubic inches is:
   \[
   1 \text{ cubic foot} = 12 \times 12 \times 12 = 1728 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   Let the side length of the cube be \( s \) inches. The volume of a cube is given by \( s^3 \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1728
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the properties of the cross product. The cross product is distributive over vector addition, so we can expand the expression as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Now, we substitute the given values of the cross products:

That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the order of selection of the points does not matter, we can fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in the remaining positions. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the points, which is \(6\) ways.

Next, we need to count the number of arrangements where the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, these arrangements are the alternating patterns \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Therefore, there are \(2\) such arrangements.

The probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements. Thus, the probability is:

First, we calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

Next, we know that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of these two areas:

\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member committee with all members from the same party:**
   - The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 Republicans is \( \binom{8}{5} \):
     \[
     \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two roots: \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is less than zero between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, we have:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the part of the solution where \(y < 0\). Thus, we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(-4 < y^2 + 4y\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
This simplifies to:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The expression \((y + 2)^2\) is a square and is always non-negative, except when \(y = -2\). Therefore, \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) for all \(y \neq -2\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, \(y \neq -2\) is always true. Thus, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting the given value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 4p).
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right),

\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 4p\right),

\[

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Now, let's determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f(3) = 0 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution is \( x = 3 \). So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f(-3) = 6 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. Therefore, \( f(2) = 6 \).

From the above, the solutions are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). Since \( x \leq 3 \) for the first solution and \( x > 3 \) for the second solution, we have \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5

"To determine the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center of the octahedron. However, for our purposes, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant.

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( F \) as \( x \). The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2. \]

This sum is constant and equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center of the octahedron. However, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant.

The sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is:
\[ 6 \times \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} s\right)^2 = 6 \times \frac{1}{2} s^2 = 3s^2, \]
where \( s \) is the edge length of the octahedron.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is the same for any point. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = 324 + x^2. \]

This sum is constant and equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center of the octahedron. However, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant.

The sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is:

"To determine how many digits are the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[

\[

\[

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:

- Base 7: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The digits that are the same are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\). There are 3 digits that are the same.

\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

First, we find the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We start by expressing \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so we use a known result for the roots of a quartic polynomial. The product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) for the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\) is given by \(d^2\). In our case, \(d = 2\), so:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2^2 = 4.
\]

Now we know that \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0\). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - 4 = 0.
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1\), we use the identity:
\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Expanding and simplifying this expression is also complex, but it can be shown that:
\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = -2.
\]

Thus, the polynomial whose roots are \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) is:
\[
t^3 - 2t - 4 = 0.
\]

We solve this polynomial by trying possible rational roots. Testing \(t = 2\):
\[
2^3 - 2 \cdot 2 - 4 = 8 - 4 - 4 = 0.
\]

So, \(t = 2\) is a root. We can factor \(t^3 - 2t - 4\) as:
\[
t^3 - 2t - 4 = (t - 2)(t^2 + 2t + 2).
\]

The roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 + 2t + 2 = 0\) are:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2i}{2} = -1 \pm i.

Therefore, the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 2t - 4 = 0\) are \(2, -1 + i,\) and \(-1 - i\). Hence, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's define the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). Let the length of \(AB\) be \(2a\) and the length of \(AD\) be \(2b\). Since \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(2a = k \cdot 2b\) or \(a = kb\).

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the intersection of the diagonals, which is the midpoint of both \(AB\) and \(CD\), and also the midpoint of both \(AD\) and \(BC\). Therefore, the coordinates of \(O\) are \((0, 0)\).

Next, we need to find the regions inside the rectangle where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \(O\) to a vertex will form a boundary for the region where points are closer to \(O\) than to that vertex. For example, the perpendicular bisector of \(OA\) is the line \(x = 0\), the perpendicular bisector of \(OB\) is the line \(x = a\), the perpendicular bisector of \(OC\) is the line \(x = 0\), and the perpendicular bisector of \(OD\) is the line \(x = -a\). Similarly, the perpendicular bisectors of \(OA\), \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\) in the \(y\)-direction are \(y = 0\), \(y = b\), \(y = 0\), and \(y = -b\), respectively.

These perpendicular bisectors form a smaller rectangle with center \(O\) and side lengths \(a\) and \(b\). The area of this smaller rectangle is \(2a/2 \cdot 2b/2 = ab\).

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is \(2a \cdot 2b = 4ab\).

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle. Therefore, the probability is:

2. Identify the quotient and the remainder.

First, let's perform the division:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

The quotient is 9. Now, to find the remainder, we can use the relationship between the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder, which is given by:

\[ \text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} \times \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder} \]

In this case, the dividend is 54, the divisor is 6, and the quotient is 9. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 54 = (6 \times 9) + \text{Remainder} \]

First, calculate \( 6 \times 9 \):

\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 54 = 54 + \text{Remainder} \]

To find the remainder, subtract 54 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Remainder} = 54 - 54 \]
\[ \text{Remainder} = 0 \]

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide it by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total score of the students who scored 80:
   \[
   20 \text{ students} \times 80 \text{ marks/student} = 1600 \text{ marks}
   \]

2. Calculate the total score of the students who scored 90:
   \[
   8 \text{ students} \times 90 \text{ marks/student} = 720 \text{ marks}
   \]

3. Calculate the total score of the students who scored 100:
   \[
   2 \text{ students} \times 100 \text{ marks/student} = 200 \text{ marks}
   \]

4. Add up all the total scores to get the overall total score:
   \[
   1600 \text{ marks} + 720 \text{ marks} + 200 \text{ marks} = 2520 \text{ marks}
   \]

5. Divide the overall total score by the number of students to get the average score:
   \[
   \text{Average score} = \frac{2520 \text{ marks}}{30 \text{ students}} = 84 \text{ marks}
   \]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal.

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3 + n+2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n-9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals must be equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, let's solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the other equation \( 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \):
\[
2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15
\]
\[
4(7) - 13 = 28 - 13 = 15
\]

Since both equations are satisfied, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
