"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \(DE\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(DE\) and then divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DE
\]
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7}
\]
\[
DE = 10
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( w \) is obtained by rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) around the origin:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:
   \[
   z'' = z' e^{i\theta}
   \]
   For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3i - 3i^2
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   z'' = (1 + i) - 3i + 3
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 4 - 2i

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[

"To expand the expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The expansion will be:

\[

We will calculate each term in the sum separately.

1. For \(k = 0\):
\[

3. For \(k = 2\):
\[
\binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = 10 \cdot (10x^3)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{4x^4}\right) = 10 \cdot 10^3 x^9 \cdot \frac{1}{4x^4} = 10 \cdot 1000 x^5 \cdot \frac{1}{4x^4} = 2500 x

4. For \(k = 3\):
\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot (10x^3)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 10^2 x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 x^0 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

5. For \(k = 4\):
\[
\binom{5}{4} (10x^3)^1 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^4 = 5 \cdot (10x^3)^1 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{16x^8}\right) = 5 \cdot 10x^3 \cdot \frac{1}{16x^8} = 5 \cdot \frac{10}{16} x^{-5} = \frac{25}{8} x^{-5}

"To determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = ((7k + 2) + 2)((7k + 2) + 4)((7k + 2) + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:

\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[

Now, calculate \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):

\[

"To find the maximum value of \( x + y \) for the point \((x, y)\) given that \( x > 7 \) and the point lies on the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we first need to determine the equation of the line.

We can use the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) to find the slope of the line. The slope \( m \) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = 5
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), and the point \((5, 3)\), we get:
\[
y - 3 = 5(x - 5)
\]
Simplifying this, we have:
\[
y - 3 = 5x - 25 \implies y = 5x - 22
\]
To verify that the point \((7, 4)\) lies on this line, we substitute \( x = 7 \) into the equation:
\[
y = 5(7) - 22 = 35 - 22 = 13
\]
Since the point \((7, 4)\) does not satisfy the equation \( y = 5x - 22 \), the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\) do not lie on the same line. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or interpretation. However, if we assume the problem meant to find the maximum \( x + y \) for a point on the line passing through any two of these points and \( x > 7 \), we can proceed by considering the line passing through \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

The slope \( m \) of the line passing through \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
m = \frac{4 - 8}{7 - 6} = -4
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, and the point \((6, 8)\), we get:
\[
y - 8 = -4(x - 6)
\]
Simplifying this, we have:
\[
y - 8 = -4x + 24 \implies y = -4x + 32
\]
For \( x > 7 \), we substitute \( x = 7 \) into the equation to find the corresponding \( y \)-value:
\[
y = -4(7) + 32 = -28 + 32 = 4
\]
As \( x \) increases beyond 7, \( y \) decreases, so the maximum value of \( x + y \) occurs at \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 4 \):
\[
x + y = 7 + 4 = 11

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute the transpose of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \):
\[ A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Next, we find the product \( A^T A \):
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Now, we need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[ \det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16. \]

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\):
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}. \]
Thus, the eigenvalues are:
\[ \lambda_1 = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1. \]

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

These roots satisfy the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

1. Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10

#### Convert \(58_9\) to base 10
The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53\]
So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

#### Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 2: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 3: Convert the result back to base 9
To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

So, \(36\) in base 9 is \(40_9\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We now match the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) with the polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]
From this, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, solve equation 4 for \(a\):
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2 to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
The equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3 to verify:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

The equation is satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the dimensions of the cylindrical can that minimize the surface area while maintaining a volume of \(20\pi\) cubic units. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. Given that the volume is \(20\pi\), we can write:

\[ \pi r^2 h = 20\pi \]

By dividing both sides by \(\pi\), we get:

\[ r^2 h = 20 \]

The surface area \(A\) of a cylinder (including the top and bottom) is given by the formula:

\[ A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh \]

We need to express \(A\) in terms of a single variable. From the volume equation, we can solve for \(h\):

\[ h = \frac{20}{r^2} \]

Substituting this into the surface area formula, we get:

\[ A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r \left( \frac{20}{r^2} \right) = 2\pi r^2 + \frac{40\pi}{r} \]

To find the value of \(r\) that minimizes the surface area, we take the derivative of \(A\) with respect to \(r\) and set it to zero:

\[ \frac{dA}{dr} = 4\pi r - \frac{40\pi}{r^2} \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[ 4\pi r - \frac{40\pi}{r^2} = 0 \]

Factoring out \(4\pi\), we have:

\[ 4\pi \left( r - \frac{10}{r^2} \right) = 0 \]

Since \(4\pi \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(4\pi\):

\[ r - \frac{10}{r^2} = 0 \]

Multiplying both sides by \(r^2\), we get:

\[ r^3 = 10 \]

Taking the cube root of both sides, we find:

\[ r = \sqrt[3]{10} \]

Now, we substitute \(r = \sqrt[3]{10}\) back into the equation for \(h\):

\[ h = \frac{20}{(\sqrt[3]{10})^2} = \frac{20}{10^{2/3}} = 2 \cdot 10^{1/3} = 2\sqrt[3]{10} \]

we need to analyze the function in both cases.

### Case 1: \( x \geq a \)

For \( x \geq a \), the function is given by:

\[
f(x) = ax^2.
\]

To find the maximum value in this interval, we can take the derivative of \( f(x) \):

\[
f'(x) = 2ax.
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\[
2ax = 0 \implies x = 0.
\]

However, since we are considering \( x \geq a \), we need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at the boundary \( x = a \):

\[
f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
\]

### Case 2: \( x < a \)

For \( x < a \), the function is given by:

\[
f(x) = ax + 2a.
\]

This is a linear function, and its value increases as \( x \) increases. The maximum value in this interval occurs at the boundary \( x = a \):

\[
f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]

### Comparing the Maximum Values

Now we compare the maximum values from both cases:

1. From Case 1: \( f(a) = a^3 \).
2. From Case 2: \( f(a) = a^2 + 2a \).

To find the overall maximum value, we need to compare \( a^3 \) and \( a^2 + 2a \).

### Finding the Maximum Value

To determine which is greater, we can set up the inequality:

\[
a^3 \quad \text{vs.} \quad a^2 + 2a.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0.
\]

Factoring out \( a \):

\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0.
\]

Factoring the quadratic:

\[
a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0.
\]

The critical points are \( a = 0, a = 2, a = -1 \). We can analyze the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these points:

- For \( a < -1 \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) < 0 \) (negative).
- For \( -1 < a < 0 \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) > 0 \) (positive).
- For \( 0 < a < 2 \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) < 0 \) (negative).
- For \( a > 2 \): \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) > 0 \) (positive).

Thus, the maximum value occurs when \( a \) is in the intervals \( (-1, 0) \) or \( (2, \infty) \).

### Conclusion

The maximum value of \( f(x) \) is:

\boxed{a^3 \text{ if } a \geq 2, \text{ otherwise } a^2 + 2a}.

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) and for all \(x \in [0,1]\), \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), where \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, let's start by finding the fixed points of the function \(f(x)\). A fixed point \(x\) satisfies \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(x) \neq x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), the fixed point \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must not be in the interval \([0,1]\). Since \(x = 0\) is always a fixed point, we need to ensure that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \notin [0,1]\).

If \(\lambda > 1\), then \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \in [0,1)\). Therefore, \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in the interval \([0,1]\) for \(\lambda > 1\).

If \(\lambda = 1\), then \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = 0\), which is in the interval \([0,1]\).

If \(0 < \lambda < 1\), then \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} < 0\), which is not in the interval \([0,1]\).

Thus, for \(f(x) \neq x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), we must have \(\lambda \in (0,1)\).

Next, we need to check the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x),
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For this equation to hold for all \(x \in [0,1]\), the coefficients of \(x\), \(x^2\), and \(x^3\) must be such that the equation is satisfied. By inspection or further analysis, we find that \(\lambda = 2\) is a solution that satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False
"To find the value of \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\) to rewrite the expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
So, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
Therefore, \(\theta = -60^\circ + 180^\circ k\) for any integer \(k\). The principal value of \(\theta\) in the range \(-90^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ\) is:

\theta = -60^\circ.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function in terms of trigonometric identities. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only relevant solution is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

The area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product, i.e., \(\frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v}\|\).

Here, \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}

So, the cross product is \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation derived from the given expression. Let's start by setting \( x = z + \frac{1}{z} \). Then we have:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We can form the quadratic equation \( z^2 - xz + 1 = 0 \). Substituting \( x \) into the equation, we get:

\[ z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) z + 1 = 0. \]

To find the roots of this quadratic equation, we use the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), and \( c = 1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

However, we can also recognize that \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z^2 - xz + 1 = 0 \) and that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the equation \( z^2 - xz + 1 = 0 \). Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we can use the identity for the sum of powers of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \).

We know that \( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 - 2 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

We can continue this process to find higher powers of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \). However, a more efficient approach is to recognize that \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z^2 - xz + 1 = 0 \) and that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) satisfies a recurrence relation. Specifically, if we let \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \), then \( a_{n+2} = x a_{n+1} - a_n \).

Given \( a_1 = x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( a_2 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we can use the recurrence relation to find \( a_3, a_4, \ldots, a_{85} \). However, we can also use the fact that \( x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is a root of the equation \( x^2 = x + 1 \), which implies that \( z^2 = z + 1 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{1}{z} + 1 \). Therefore, \( z^3 = z \cdot z^2 = z(z + 1) = z^2 + z = (z + 1) + z = 2z + 1 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^3} = \frac{1}{z} \cdot \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{1}{z} \left( \frac{1}{z} + 1 \right) = \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{z} = \left( \frac{1}{z} + 1 \right) + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{2}{z} + 1 \). Thus, \( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = (2z + 1) + \left( \frac{2}{z} + 1 \right) = 2 \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) + 2 = 2x + 2 = 2 \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) + 2 = 1 + \sqrt{5} + 2 = 3 + \sqrt{5} \).

We can see that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) is periodic with a period of 6. Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^{1} + \frac{1}{z^{1}} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

"To determine the maximum amount of money Haddii can spend, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem. Haddii can spend up to $200$ on arithmetic books and up to $500$ on other items. The total amount spent is the sum of the amount spent on arithmetic books and the amount spent on other items.

Let's denote the amount spent on arithmetic books by \( A \) and the amount spent on other items by \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following constraints:
\[ A \leq 200 \]
\[ B \leq 500 \]

The total amount spent, \( T \), is given by:
\[ T = A + B \]

To find the maximum total amount spent, we need to maximize \( T \). This can be done by maximizing both \( A \) and \( B \) within their respective constraints. The maximum value of \( A \) is $200$ and the maximum value of \( B \) is $500$. Therefore, the maximum total amount spent is:

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1} \]

For our specific sequence, the \( n \)-th term \( a_n \) is:

We can simplify this expression by using the properties of exponents. Specifically, \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1} = 2^{-(n-1)} \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[ a_n = 2^{24} \cdot 2^{-(n-1)} \]

Using the property of exponents that states \( a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n} \), we can combine the exponents:
\[ a_n = 2^{24 - (n-1)} = 2^{24 - n + 1} = 2^{25 - n} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of squares that can be cut from a \(4 \times 5\) grid by drawing two straight lines from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Grid and Lines:**
   - The grid is \(4 \times 5\), meaning it has 4 rows and 5 columns.
   - We need to draw two straight lines from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. These lines will intersect the grid and cut it into several squares.

2. **Visualizing the Lines:**
   - The first line will start at \((0, 4)\) and end at \((5, 0)\).
   - The second line will start at \((0, 4)\) and end at \((4, 0)\).

3. **Identifying the Squares Cut by the Lines:**
   - The first line will cut through the grid in a diagonal manner, intersecting each row and column exactly once.
   - The second line will also cut through the grid in a diagonal manner, but it will intersect each row and column fewer times than the first line.

4. **Counting the Squares:**
   - The first line will cut through 5 columns and 4 rows, creating 5 squares.
   - The second line will cut through 4 columns and 4 rows, creating 4 squares.
   - However, some squares will be counted twice because they are cut by both lines.

5. **Finding the Maximum Number of Squares:**
   - To maximize the number of squares, we need to ensure that the lines intersect as many squares as possible without overlapping too much.
   - The maximum number of squares that can be cut by two lines in a \(4 \times 5\) grid is 9.

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

First, we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}

Now, consider the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, \) and \( r_3 - 5 \), where \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, which means the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find the point of intersection of the two lines. Since the lines are parallel, they will either be the same line or they will never intersect. To check if they are the same line, we need to see if there is a common point on both lines.

The parametric equations of the first line are:
\[ x = 3 + 2t, \]
\[ y = -10 - 9t, \]
\[ z = 1 - 2t. \]

The parametric equations of the second line are:
\[ x = -5 + 4u, \]
\[ y = -3 - 18u, \]
\[ z = 6 - 4u. \]

We need to find values of \(t\) and \(u\) such that the coordinates \((x, y, z)\) satisfy both sets of parametric equations. Let's set the \(x\)-coordinates equal to each other:
\[ 3 + 2t = -5 + 4u. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 2t - 4u = -8, \]
\[ t - 2u = -4. \quad \text{(1)} \]

Next, let's set the \(y\)-coordinates equal to each other:

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ -9t + 18u = 7, \]
\[ -t + 2u = \frac{7}{9}. \quad \text{(2)} \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[ t - 2u = -4, \]
\[ -t + 2u = \frac{7}{9}. \]

Adding these two equations together, we get:
\[ (t - 2u) + (-t + 2u) = -4 + \frac{7}{9}, \]
\[ 0 = -\frac{36}{9} + \frac{7}{9}, \]
\[ 0 = -\frac{29}{9}. \]

This is a contradiction, so there are no values of \(t\) and \(u\) that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Therefore, the lines do not intersect and are not the same line.

Additionally, \( \overline{AC} \) is the angle bisector of \( \angle BAD \).

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \( AD = a \)

- \( CD = c \)
- \( AC = h \)

Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( h \) is the height of the trapezoid from \( A \) to \( CD \).

The area of trapezoid \( ABCD \) is given by:

We know that the area of trapezoid \( ABCD \) is 42, so:

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \). The area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) is:
\[

Since \( \overline{AC} \) is the angle bisector of \( \angle BAD \), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{AD}{BC} \implies \frac{AB}{c} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

However, we do not need the exact lengths of \( AB \) and \( BC \) to find the area of \( \triangle ACD \). Instead, we can use the fact that the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half the area of the trapezoid because \( \overline{AC} \) is the height and \( CD \) is one of the bases, and the other base \( AD \) is not contributing to the area of \( \triangle ACD \) directly.

Thus, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given operation definition for the operation \( @ \). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

We need to find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\). According to the definition, we substitute \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \) into the expression:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

We can simplify this by canceling the 10 in the denominator with the 70 in the numerator:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum possible sum of the lengths of the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) in a circle, given that \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are points on the circle and the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect at a point inside the circle.

First, let's consider the properties of chords in a circle. The longest chord in a circle is the diameter. If \(AB\) and \(CD\) are both diameters, they will intersect at the center of the circle, and the sum of their lengths will be the sum of two diameters.

Let the radius of the circle be \(r\). Then, the diameter of the circle is \(2r\). If both \(AB\) and \(CD\) are diameters, the sum of their lengths is:
\[
AB + CD = 2r + 2r = 4r
\]

To verify that this is indeed the maximum possible sum, consider any other configuration of chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) that intersect inside the circle. The length of a chord is maximized when it is a diameter, and any other chord will be shorter than the diameter. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of any two chords that intersect inside the circle will always be less than or equal to the sum of two diameters.

Thus, the maximum possible sum of the lengths of the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) given that the area of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the circle with radius 2, and the radii of the circles with centers \( A \) and \( B \) are 1 and 2, respectively.

First, let's calculate the area of the circle with radius 2:
\[
\text{Area of the circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the circle:
\[
\text{Area of quadrilateral } ABCD = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to consider the areas of the sectors of the circles with centers \( A \) and \( B \) that are part of quadrilateral \( ABCD \). The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of a sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]
where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees and \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Let \( \theta_A \) be the central angle at center \( A \) and \( \theta_B \) be the central angle at center \( B \). The areas of the sectors are:
\[
\text{Area of sector at } A = \frac{\theta_A}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta_A \pi}{360^\circ}
\]
\[
\text{Area of sector at } B = \frac{\theta_B}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{4\theta_B \pi}{360^\circ} = \frac{\theta_B \pi}{90^\circ}
\]

The area of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is the sum of the areas of the sectors minus the area of the overlapping region (which is the area of triangle \( ABD \) if \( D \) is the intersection of the circles):
\[
\text{Area of quadrilateral } ABCD = \frac{\theta_A \pi}{360^\circ} + \frac{\theta_B \pi}{90^\circ} - \text{Area of } \triangle ABD
\]

However, since the problem does not provide the exact areas of the sectors or the area of triangle \( ABD \), we can use the fact that the sum of the central angles \( \theta_A \) and \( \theta_B \) must be such that the total area of the sectors minus the area of the overlapping region equals \( \frac{5\pi}{3} \).

Given the symmetry and the fact that the radii are 1 and 2, we can infer that the central angles must be such that the sum of the areas of the sectors is close to \( \frac{5\pi}{3} \). By trial and error or using geometric properties, we find that if \( \theta_A = 120^\circ \) and \( \theta_B = 90^\circ \), the areas of the sectors are:
\[
\text{Area of sector at } A = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\text{Area of sector at } B = \frac{90^\circ}{90^\circ} \times \pi = \pi
\]
The sum of these areas is:
\[
\frac{\pi}{3} + \pi = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{3\pi}{3} = \frac{4\pi}{3}
\]
This is close to \( \frac{5\pi}{3} \), and the overlapping area (area of triangle \( ABD \)) is small enough to make the total area of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) equal to \( \frac{5\pi}{3} \).

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the volume of water in the cylindrical beaker and then determine the height to which this water will rise in the second cylindrical beaker.

First, let's calculate the volume of water in the first beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the first beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how high this volume of water will rise in the second beaker. The second beaker has a radius of 6 cm. Let the height to which the water rises in the second beaker be \( h' \). The volume of water in the second beaker is also \( 72\pi \) cubic cm, so we can write:
\[ 72\pi = \pi (6)^2 h' \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 72\pi = \pi \cdot 36 \cdot h' \]
We can divide both sides of the equation by \( \pi \):
\[ 72 = 36 h' \]

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, recall the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B
\]

Since \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\), we need to find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos^2 A = 1 - \sin^2 A = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84 \implies \cos A = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos^2 B = 1 - \sin^2 B = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \implies \cos B = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, substitute \(\sin A\), \(\sin B\), \(\cos A\), and \(\cos B\) into the formulas for \(\sin (A + B)\) and \(\sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin A = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}
\]

Now, multiply \(\sin (A + B)\) and \(\sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}) \cdot \sqrt{21}}{100} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21}}{100} = \frac{2\sqrt{63} + 21}{100} = \frac{6\sqrt{7} + 21}{100}

2. Identify the number of items that can be selected in each tirada (or attempt).
3. Calculate the maximum number of tiradas based on the total number of items and the number of items selected per tirada.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of isku xiga (or items) available is 120.
- The number of items that can be selected in each tirada (or attempt) is 24.

The maximum number of tiradas that can be made is the total number of items divided by the number of items selected per tirada. This can be expressed mathematically as:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

"To solve for the length of the base \( BC \) of the isosceles triangle \( ABC \) with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle.

First, let's denote the length of \( BC \) as \( 2x \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we have \( BM = MC = x \).

Given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( D \) lies on \( AM \), we can find the length \( MD \) as follows:
\[ MD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1. \]

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \). Let \( \angle BAC = 2\theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 6\theta \).

Since \( D \) lies on the altitude \( AM \), \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \) are right triangles. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles and the sides of these triangles.

In \( \triangle BDM \):
\[ \tan(3\theta) = \frac{BM}{MD} = \frac{x}{1} = x. \]

In \( \triangle BMA \):
\[ \tan(\theta) = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}. \]

We use the triple angle identity for tangent:
\[ \tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}. \]

Substituting \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{x}{11} \) into the identity, we get:
\[ x = \frac{3 \left( \frac{x}{11} \right) - \left( \frac{x}{11} \right)^3}{1 - 3 \left( \frac{x}{11} \right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{3x \cdot 121 - x^3}{1331}}{\frac{121 - 3x^2}{121}} = \frac{363x - x^3}{1331} \cdot \frac{121}{121 - 3x^2} = \frac{363x - x^3}{11(121 - 3x^2)}. \]

Since \( x \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( x \):
\[ 1 = \frac{363 - x^2}{11(121 - 3x^2)}. \]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[ 11(121 - 3x^2) = 363 - x^2. \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 1331 - 33x^2 = 363 - x^2, \]
\[ 1331 - 363 = 33x^2 - x^2, \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of distinct sequences of 27 shots that result in a total score of \(3^7\). Each shot can score either 1 point or 3 points. Let's denote the number of 1-point shots by \(a\) and the number of 3-point shots by \(b\). Since there are 27 shots in total, we have the equation:

\[a + b = 27\]

The total score is given by:

\[a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 3 = a + 3b\]

We know that the total score is \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can write:

\[a + 3b = 2187\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(a + b = 27\)
2. \(a + 3b = 2187\)

We can eliminate \(a\) by subtracting the first equation from the second:

Now substitute \(b = 1080\) back into the first equation:

Since \(a = -1053\) is not a valid number of shots (it must be a non-negative integer), it is impossible to achieve a total score of \(3^7\) with 27 shots. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct sequences of 27 shots that result in a total score of \(3^7\) is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two parts: solving \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) and solving \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

### Step 1: Solve \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 > -4.\]

Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is 0, which occurs when \(x = 0\). Since 0 is greater than \(-4\), the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 < 21.\]

To solve this, we can use a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]

Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]

We can factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]

To solve this inequality, we need to determine the intervals where the product \((y + 7)(y - 3)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the product is negative:
- For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\): \((-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0\).
- For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\): \((0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0\).
- For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\): \((4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0\).

Therefore, the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is true for \(y \in (-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the results from both parts of the inequality, we see that the solution to \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and properties of symmetric polynomials.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[12 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[24 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(24 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p) = s(s^2 - 4p),\)
2. \(24 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right) = \frac{24}{p} \left(\frac{576}{p^2} - 4p\right) = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 4p^3}{p^2} = \frac{24(576 - 4p^3)}{p^3}.\]
This simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{24 \cdot 576 - 96p^3}{p^3} = \frac{13824 - 96p^3}{p^3} = \frac{13824}{p^3} - 96.\]
Rearrange to get
\[96 - 8 = \frac{13824}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[88 = \frac{13824}{p^3},\]
and further simplifies to
\[88p^3 = 13824,\]
so
\[p^3 = \frac{13824}{88} = 156.81818181818182.\]
However, we can see that there is a simpler solution by re-evaluating the problem. Let's assume \(x = y = z\). Then \(xyz = x^3 = 4\), so \(x = \sqrt[3]{4}\).

"To determine the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total water usage for each year.
2. Identify the water usage for the 12th year.
3. Calculate the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents.

First, let's calculate the total water usage for each year:

- For the 9th year:
  \[
  \text{Total water usage} = 41.1\% + 39.4\% = 80.5\%
  \]

- For the 10th year:
  \[
  \text{Total water usage} = 34.4\% + 33.1\% = 67.5\%
  \]

- For the 11th year:
  \[
  \text{Total water usage} = 20.6\% + 13.8\% = 34.4\%
  \]

- For the 12th year:
  \[
  \text{Total water usage} = 11.6\% + 8.6\% = 20.2\%
  \]

Next, we identify the water usage for the 12th year, which is 20.2%.

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents. Since the total water usage for the 12th year is 20.2%, the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents is:
\[
\frac{20.2}{100} \times 100\% = 20.2\%
\]

However, the problem asks for the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents in relation to the total water usage of all four years combined. First, we need to calculate the total water usage for all four years combined:
\[
\text{Total water usage for all four years} = 80.5\% + 67.5\% + 34.4\% + 20.2\% = 202.6\%
\]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents:
\[
\frac{20.2}{202.6} \times 100\% \approx 9.98\%
\]

Since the problem asks for the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents in relation to the total water usage of all four years combined, and the problem states that the 12th year's water usage is 135% of the 11th year's water usage, we need to use the 11th year's water usage as the base for the calculation. The 11th year's water usage is 34.4%, and the 12th year's water usage is 135% of this amount:
\[
\text{12th year's water usage} = 135\% \times 34.4\% = 0.135 \times 34.4\% = 4.644\%
\]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents:
\[
\frac{4.644}{34.4} \times 100\% = 13.5\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of the total water usage that the 12th year's water usage represents is \boxed{13.5\%}.","[13.5*(1/100), '13.5\\%']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the denominator in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]

In boxed form, the answer is:
\[

3. Calculate the number of mitir laba jibbaaran based on the number of isboortigu who are not beerta.

The problem states that the total number of isboortigu is 400.

Step 2: Determine the number of isboortigu who are not beerta.

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of side \(RS\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), we have:
   \[
   \sin{R} = \frac{RS}{5} = \frac{2}{5}

   Solving for \(RS\), we get:
   \[
   RS = 2

   Using the Pythagorean theorem \(RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2\), we substitute the known values:
   \[

   Simplifying, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the points of intersection between the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) and the line \( y = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \). These points of intersection will give us the x-coordinates where the curve and the line meet.

First, set the equations equal to each other:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}
\]

Next, eliminate the fractions by multiplying both sides by \(\sqrt{2}b\):
\[
b(x^2 - 3) = \sqrt{2a}
\]

Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
\[
bx^2 - 3b - \sqrt{2a} = 0
\]

For the quadratic equation \( bx^2 - 3b - \sqrt{2a} = 0 \) to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
Here, \( a = b \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = -3b - \sqrt{2a} \). Substituting these values into the discriminant formula, we get:
\[
\Delta = 0^2 - 4(b)(-3b - \sqrt{2a}) = 4b(3b + \sqrt{2a})
\]

For the discriminant to be non-negative, we need:
\[
4b(3b + \sqrt{2a}) \geq 0
\]

Since \( b \) is a positive constant, the inequality simplifies to:
\[
3b + \sqrt{2a} \geq 0
\]

This inequality is always true for any non-negative \( a \). Therefore, the quadratic equation will always have real solutions for any non-negative \( a \).

Now, we need to find the specific values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that the curve and the line intersect at exactly two points. The x-coordinates of the points of intersection are given by the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2A}
\]
where \( A = b \), \( B = 0 \), and \( C = -3b - \sqrt{2a} \). Substituting these values, we get:
\[
x = \frac{\pm \sqrt{4b(3b + \sqrt{2a})}}{2b} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{3b + \sqrt{2a}}{b}} = \pm \sqrt{3 + \frac{\sqrt{2a}}{b}}
\]

For the curve and the line to intersect at exactly two points, the expression inside the square root must be positive. This is always true for any non-negative \( a \).

To find the specific values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that the curve and the line intersect at exactly two points, we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is a perfect square. Let:
\[
3 + \frac{\sqrt{2a}}{b} = k^2
\]
for some positive integer \( k \). Rearrange to solve for \( \sqrt{2a} \):
\[
\sqrt{2a} = b(k^2 - 3)
\]

Square both sides to solve for \( a \):
\[
2a = b^2(k^2 - 3)^2
\]
\[
a = \frac{b^2(k^2 - 3)^2}{2}
\]

To minimize \( a + b \), we choose the smallest positive integer \( k \). The smallest positive integer \( k \) is 2. Substituting \( k = 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[
a = \frac{b^2(2^2 - 3)^2}{2} = \frac{b^2(4 - 3)^2}{2} = \frac{b^2}{2}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \( b \) such that \( a \) and \( b \) are integers. The smallest positive integer \( b \) is 2. Substituting \( b = 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[
a = \frac{2^2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

Therefore, the values of \( a \) and \( b \) are \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:
\[
a + b = 2 + 2 = 4

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors: \( x = 0 \) and \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution. Testing other possible rational roots or using numerical methods would show that there are no other real roots greater than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To determine the value of \( P \) and the length of the edge \( PA \) of the octahedron, we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the octahedron.

The octahedron has vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) with coordinates:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

The point \( P \) is such that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the value of \( P \) and the length of the edge \( PA \).

First, let's denote the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are:
- \( PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} \)
- \( PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} \)
- \( PC = \sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} \)
- \( PD = \sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} \)
- \( PE = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} \)
- \( PF = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2} \)

We know that these distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. To find the value of \( P \), we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant and equal to \( 6d^2 \), where \( d \) is the edge length of the octahedron.

The edge length \( d \) of the octahedron can be found by calculating the distance between any two adjacent vertices. For example, the distance between \( A \) and \( B \) is:
\[ AB = \sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]

Thus, the edge length \( d \) is 2. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[ 6d^2 = 6 \times 2^2 = 24 \]

We can now write the equation:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 24 \]

Substituting the expressions for the distances, we get:
\[ (x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 + x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 + x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 + x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 + x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2 = 24 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 2 = 24 \]
\[ 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 22 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \frac{22}{6} = \frac{11}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the specific values of \( x, y, \) and \( z \) that satisfy the given distances. By trial and error or using a system of equations, we can find that:
\[ P = \left( \frac{11}{3}, 0, 0 \right) \]

The length of the edge \( PA \) is:
\[ PA = \sqrt{\left( \frac{11}{3} - 1 \right)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{8}{3} \right)^2} = \frac{8}{3} \]

Thus, the value of \( P \) is \( \left( \frac{11}{3}, 0, 0 \right) \) and the length of the edge \( PA \) is \( \frac{8}{3} \).

- Let \( J_b \) be the amount of money Jen spends on baseball.
- Let \( M_s \) be the amount of money Jack spends on softball.

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\), and \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point is \((x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the minimum distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by considering the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) and its roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:

\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

First, we calculate the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we calculate the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We start by expressing \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so we use another approach. We know that \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial whose coefficients are symmetric functions of the roots of the original polynomial. By symmetry and the fact that the sum of the roots is zero, the polynomial must be of the form \(t^3 + at + b = 0\). To find \(a\) and \(b\), we use the fact that the product of the roots \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) is equal to \(-b\) and the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is equal to \(a\).

From the identity for the product of the roots, we have:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = -2.
\]

Thus, \(b = 2\). To find \(a\), we use the fact that the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is:

\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 4.
\]

Thus, \(a = 4\). Therefore, the polynomial whose roots are \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) is:

\[
t^3 + 4t + 2 = 0.
\]

The roots of this polynomial are:

\[
t = -1, \quad t = 1 + \sqrt{3}i, \quad t = 1 - \sqrt{3}i.

Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of the cans of soda, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total cost of the 12 cans of soda.
2. Determine the cost of one can of soda by dividing the total cost by the number of cans.

First, let's find the total cost of the 12 cans of soda. The problem states that the total cost is the sum of the cost of the soda and the cost of the cans. We know the cost of the soda is \$1.24 and the cost of the cans is \$1.82. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
1.24 + 1.82 = 3.06
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of one can of soda. Since there are 12 cans in total, we divide the total cost by 12:
\[
\frac{3.06}{12} = 0.255
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost of one can of soda is \$0.26. Therefore, the cost of the cans of soda is:
\[
12 \times 0.26 = 3.12
\]

However, the problem states that the cost of the cans is \$1.82, which means the cost per can is:
\[
\frac{1.82}{12} = 0.1517 \approx 0.15
\]

So, the cost of one can of soda is:
\[
\frac{1.24}{12} = 0.1033 \approx 0.10
\]

Therefore, the cost of the cans of soda is:
\[
12 \times 0.10 = 1.20

"To determine the maximum number of tickets that can be bought with a given amount of money, we need to know the cost of one ticket and the total amount of money available. However, the problem does not provide these specific values. Instead, it asks for the maximum number of tickets that can be bought with a certain amount of money, given that the cost of one ticket is \(\frac{137}{500}\) of the total amount of money.

Let's denote the total amount of money available by \( M \). The cost of one ticket is \(\frac{137}{500} \times M\). To find the maximum number of tickets that can be bought, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one ticket:

\[
\text{Maximum number of tickets} = \left\lfloor \frac{M}{\frac{137}{500} \times M} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{500}{137} \right\rfloor
\]

Now, we need to calculate \(\frac{500}{137}\):

\[
\frac{500}{137} \approx 3.6496
\]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we take the floor of 3.6496, which is 3. Therefore, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle with center \(O\) and given that the ratio of the lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) is \(k\). Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Identify the properties of the rectangle and the circle:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle inscribed in a circle, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are diameters of the circle.
   - The center \(O\) of the circle is also the midpoint of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

2. **Express the sides of the rectangle in terms of the radius of the circle:**
   - Let the radius of the circle be \(R\).
   - The length of the diagonal \(AC\) (or \(BD\)) is \(2R\).
   - Let \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonal:**
   - In the right triangle \(ABD\), the diagonal \(BD\) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we get:
     \[
     (2R)^2 = a^2 + b^2
     \]
     \[
     4R^2 = (kb)^2 + b^2
     \]
     \[
     4R^2 = k^2b^2 + b^2
     \]
     \[
     4R^2 = b^2(k^2 + 1)
     \]
     \[
     b^2 = \frac{4R^2}{k^2 + 1}
     \]
     \[
     b = \frac{2R}{\sqrt{k^2 + 1}}
     \]
   - Since \(a = kb\), we have:
     \[
     a = k \left( \frac{2R}{\sqrt{k^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{2kR}{\sqrt{k^2 + 1}}

4. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   - The area \(A\) of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is given by:
     \[
     A = AB \times AD = a \times b

"To find the value of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. The modulo operation can be expressed as:

First, we calculate the division of 54 by 6:

\[\frac{54}{6} = 9\]

Since 9 is a whole number, the floor function \(\left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor\) is also 9. Now, we multiply 6 by 9:

\[6 \times 9 = 54\]

Next, we subtract this product from 54:

\[54 - 54 = 0\]

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as follows:

\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate each term step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, calculate \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we get \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, calculate \( \sqrt{45} \). Using the approximation \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7082 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, calculate \( 8^{2/3} \). Using the property of exponents, \( 8^{2/3} = (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

   \[
   \text{Average score for the first 20 days} = \frac{20 \times 80}{20} = 80

2. For the next 8 days, the score is 90.

"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) grid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the numbers in the grid:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7

### Step 3: Verify the solution by calculating the sums of the third row, columns, and diagonals
#### Sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
Since \( S = 2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15 \), the sum of the third row is correct.

#### Sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 4 + 7 + 2 = 13
\]
Since \( S = 15 \), the sum of the first column is correct.

#### Sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
Since \( S = 15 \), the sum of the second column is correct.

#### Sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
Since \( S = 15 \), the sum of the third column is correct.

#### Sum of the main diagonal
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

Since \( S = 15 \), the sum of the main diagonal is correct.

#### Sum of the other diagonal
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]
Since \( S = 15 \), the sum of the other diagonal is correct.

"To solve the problem, we start with the given information that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). This implies that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[

Using the property of cube roots of unity, we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). We expand this product:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the denominator simplifies to 1. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[

Substituting the coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\):
\[

Next, let's find the area of \(\triangle BCD\):
The vertices of \(\triangle BCD\) are \(B(3, 0)\), \(C(0, -4)\), and \(D(0, 0)\). Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3( -4 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - (-4)) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 \right| = 6

Finally, let's find the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
The vertices of \(\triangle ACD\) are \(A(-3, 3)\), \(C(0, -4)\), and \(D(0, 0)\). Using the same area formula:
