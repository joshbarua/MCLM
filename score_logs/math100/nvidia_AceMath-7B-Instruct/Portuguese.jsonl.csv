"To find the value of \( DE \) given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \( \sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} \).

Given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the known value of \( EF \) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \( DF \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( DF \) and then divide by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know \( DF = 10 \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( DE \). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this triangle, \( DF \) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \( DF \) and \( EF \) into the equation, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \( DE^2 \), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the value of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.**
2. **Rotate the translated \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \).**
3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.**

Let's start with the given complex numbers:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

### Step 1: Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.
First, we find the difference \( z - c \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

### Step 2: Rotate the translated \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \).
To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} - 3i \frac{2}{2} - 3i^2 \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

### Step 3: Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.
Now, we add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:
\[ w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:
\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \]","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[121 \div 11 = 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is \(2 \times 11^2\).

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor separately:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720
\]

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the term constant in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Next, we calculate \((10x^3)^2\):

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]

Then, we calculate \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon.

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since this midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the other possible diagonal.

The other diagonal connects the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

Since this midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Again, \(x = 4\) is not a valid solution because \(x > 7\). Let's consider the last possible diagonal.

The last diagonal connects the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since this midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\).

Finally, we find \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we factor it first:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]

Setting the factored form equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \implies x = 7 \text{ or } x = -2. \]

Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator \( P(x) = 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, we have \( c = 0 \).

Now, we need to find the sum \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[

\[

\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

Calculating each term, we get:

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank.

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour.

We can use the chain rule to relate these rates. Differentiating the volume formula with respect to time, we get:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two parts: for \(x \geq a\) and for \(x < a\).

First, consider the part of the function for \(x \geq a\):
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) on this interval is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

Next, consider the part of the function for \(x < a\):
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and if \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing. The value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left is \(f(a^-) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on the interval \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left. This ensures that there is no horizontal line that lies entirely above the graph of \(f(x)\).

Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
  \[ (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0. \]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
  \[ (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \geq 0. \]
  The inequality does not hold.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
  \[ (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0. \]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
  \[ (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \geq 0. \]
  The inequality does not hold.

Additionally, the inequality holds at the roots \(a = -1\), \(a = 0\), and \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) is:
\[ a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]. \]
Since we are looking for the largest value of \(a\), we choose \(a = 2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\). So, we need to solve the system:
\[
y = \lambda x(1 - x) \quad \text{and} \quad x = \lambda y(1 - y).
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) \implies x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) \implies x(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\)
2. \(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0\).

The first case \(x = 0\) corresponds to the fixed point \(x = 0\), which we already know. We need to consider the second case:
\[
1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Let's test the boundary values of \(x\):
- If \(x = 1\), then \(\lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda \cdot 1 + \lambda \cdot 1^2) = 0 \neq 1\). So, \(x = 1\) is not a solution.
- If \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = x\). So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, not a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Therefore, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\) has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the function and its behavior, we find that this equation has a solution for \(\lambda \in (2, 4]\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the equation becomes:
\[
4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 1 \implies 4(1 - x)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = 1.
\]
This equation has a solution \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), so \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a fixed point, not a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

For \(\lambda \in (2, 4]\), the equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Thus, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan (A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to identify \(\theta\). Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we can rewrite it as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
This matches the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 35^\circ\):
\[
\tan 35^\circ = \frac{\sin 35^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 35^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[

\[

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \).

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and thus the given equation becomes:

\[
e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

\[

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta).
\]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This can be derived from the multiple-angle formula for cosine. Since \( \cos(5\theta) = -\cos\theta \), we have \( 5\theta = \pi - \theta + 2k\pi \) for some integer \( k \), or \( 6\theta = \pi + 2k\pi \), which simplifies to \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{3} \).

We need to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). Notice that \( 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \), so \( 85\theta = \theta + 14\pi \), and thus \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos\theta \). Therefore,

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the centroid and similar triangles.

1. **Centroid Properties**: The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Similar Triangles**: Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through the centroid \( G \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians, which is \( 2:3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) is \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \).

3. **Area of Triangle \( AMN \)**: The area of triangle \( AMN \) is \( \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \). Since the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 units squared and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units, we can substitute these values into the formula.

Here are the steps:

1. Substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \) into the formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5
   \]

2. First, multiply 30 by 6.5:
   \[
   30 \times 6.5 = 195

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula again:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",350,"[350, '350']",True
"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) to a decimal, we first need to simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7 = 4 \cdot 78125 = 312500\). So, the fraction becomes \(\frac{21}{312500}\).

Next, we perform the division of 21 by 312500. Using a calculator, we get:

"To determine how many two-digit positive integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is the product of the lowest power of each prime factor common to both numbers. Therefore, the GCD of 100 and 150 is:
\[ \text{GCD}(100, 150) = 2^1 \times 5^2 = 50 \]

The common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of their GCD, 50. Let's list the factors of 50:
\[ 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 \]

We are only interested in the two-digit factors of 50. From the list above, the two-digit factors are:

"To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( 2^{24} = k^n \), and since \( k \) must be a power of 2, we can write \( k = 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2^m \) into the equation, we get:

\[
2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn}
\]

For the equation \( 2^{24} = 2^{mn} \) to hold, the exponents must be equal, so we have:

\[
24 = mn
\]

We need to find all pairs \((m, n)\) of positive integers such that \( mn = 24 \) and \( n > 1 \). First, we list the factors of 24:

\[

\]

Since \( n > 1 \), we exclude \( n = 1 \). The possible values for \( n \) are \( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, \) and \( 24 \). Therefore, there are 7 possible values for \( n \).

"Para resolver o problema, precisamos determinar quantas moedas de dez centavos e quantos níqueis Hillary tem, sabendo que ela tem onze moedas em total e que elas valem 75 centavos.

1. **Definir as variáveis**:
   - Seja \( x \) o número de moedas de dez centavos.
   - Seja \( y \) o número de níqueis.

2. **Montar as equações**:
   - A equação que representa o total de moedas é:
     \[
     x + y = 11
     \]
   - A equação que representa o valor total das moedas é:
     \[
     10x + 0y = 75

     (Note que os níqueis não contribuem para o valor total, pois são de zero centavos.)

3. **Simplificar a equação do valor**:
   - A equação do valor se simplifica a:
     \[
     10x = 75
     \]
   - Dividindo ambos os lados por 10:

"Os primeiros seis números primos são: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, e 13.

Para que a soma dos números que Paul e Jesse escolhem seja par, devemos considerar as propriedades das somas de números:

1. A soma de dois números é par se ambos forem pares ou ambos forem ímpares.
2. O único número par entre os primeiros seis primos é 2. Os demais são ímpares (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

Portanto, para que a soma seja par, as possibilidades são:
- Ambos escolhem um número par (não é possível, pois há apenas um número par).
- Ambos escolhem um número ímpar.

Os números ímpares são: 3, 5, 7, 11, e 13. Existem 5 números ímpares.

2. Solve for \( y = b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Now, we isolate \( 2b \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Finally, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

"To determine the area of the shaded region in the given figure, we need to analyze the arrangement of the squares and the triangles formed by the diagonals.

First, let's identify the total number of squares and their arrangement:
- There are 4 rows and 5 columns of squares, so the total number of squares is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

Next, let's identify the shaded regions:
- There are two shaded triangles in the figure. Each triangle is formed by a diagonal drawn from the top-left corner of a square to the bottom-right corner of an adjacent square.

Now, let's calculate the area of each shaded triangle:
- Each square has a side length of 1, so the area of each square is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).
- Each shaded triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 1 (the side length of the square). The area of a right triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). Therefore, the area of each shaded triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}\).

Since there are two shaded triangles, the total area of the shaded region is:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

Next, we perform the division to convert the fraction into a decimal. Dividing 4321 by 20000000, we get:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation 0.00021605. The digits are 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5. Adding these digits together, we get:
\[
2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the property of the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. A horizontal shift does not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these rewritten forms back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]

Combine the constant terms:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\). However, a known result in trigonometry states that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9.

Therefore, substitute this result into the expression:

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the internal angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Determine the measure of the missing angle:**
   Let the measure of the missing angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all the internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all the internal angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all the internal angles of the polygon is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Find the range for \(x\):**
   In a convex polygon, each internal angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must be less than \(180^\circ\).

5. **Estimate the value of \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the approximate value of \(n\) by assuming \(x\) is close to \(0\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   n \approx 7
   \]

6. **Verify the value of \(n\):**
   If \(n = 7\), the sum of the internal angles is:
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   This is less than \(1070^\circ\), so \(n\) must be greater than 7.

   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the internal angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   This is greater than \(1070^\circ\), so \(n\) must be less than 8.

   Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is 7.

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the congruence:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) (which is even) and keep \( t = 17 \) (which is odd).

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic foot, we first need to convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches. Since there are \(12\) inches in a foot, the volume in cubic inches is:
\[
1 \text{ cubic foot} = 12^3 \text{ cubic inches} = 1728 \text{ cubic inches}
\]
Next, we need to find the side length of the cube. Let the side length be \(s\) inches. The volume of a cube is given by \(s^3\), so we have:
\[
s^3 = 1728

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate radical, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + \sqrt{b}\) is \(a - \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we first need to recognize that this sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

For our sequence, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[

\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we compute \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[

\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   The rectangle extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). Therefore, the width of the rectangle is \(5 - (-5) = 10\) and the height is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

2. **Calculate the number of integer points along the width and height:**
   The integer points along the width (from \(x = -4\) to \(x = 4\)) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\), which gives us 9 points. Similarly, the integer points along the height (from \(y = -3\) to \(y = 3\)) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\), which gives us 7 points.

3. **Calculate the total number of integer points inside the rectangle:**
   The total number of integer points inside the rectangle is the product of the number of points along the width and the number of points along the height. Therefore, the total number of integer points inside the rectangle is \(9 \times 7 = 63\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{z}\),

\[

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}\). Applying this property, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

We perform the scalar multiplications:

6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"To solve for the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezoid \(ABCD\). We know that \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{CD}\) as one of its legs and \(\overline{AC}\) as the other leg. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we need to use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = BC\). However, we do not need the exact value of \(b\) to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Instead, we can express \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\).

From the equation \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we can solve for \(h\):
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Substituting this into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

To find the exact value, we need to use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are proportional to their bases \(b\) and \(a\), respectively. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector, the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) is equal to the ratio of their bases:
\[
\frac{[ \triangle ABC ]}{[ \triangle ACD ]} = \frac{b}{a}
\]

The total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [ \triangle ABC ] + [ \triangle ACD ] = 42
\]

Let \(x = [ \triangle ACD ]\). Then \([ \triangle ABC ] = \frac{b}{a} x\). Substituting these into the area equation, we get:
\[
\frac{b}{a} x + x = 42
\]
\[
x \left( \frac{b}{a} + 1 \right) = 42
\]
\[
x \left( \frac{a + b}{a} \right) = 42

\[
x = 42 \times \frac{a}{a + b}

Since \(h = \frac{84}{a + b}\), we can substitute \(h\) back into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42a}{a + b}

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. The key insight is that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the order of selection does not matter, we can fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in the remaining positions. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the points, which is \(6\) ways.

Next, we need to count the number of these arrangements where the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, these arrangements correspond to the alternating patterns. If we fix \(A\) and consider the possible positions of \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), the valid arrangements are \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations). There are exactly 2 such arrangements for each fixed position of \(A\).

Since there are 4 points and each point can be fixed, we have \(4\) possible fixed points, and for each fixed point, there are \(2\) valid arrangements. Therefore, the total number of valid arrangements is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

However, we have overcounted because each arrangement is counted twice (once for each of the two segments). Therefore, the actual number of valid arrangements is \(8 / 2 = 4\).

Thus, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of valid arrangements to the total number of arrangements, which is:
\[
\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}

"To determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so the area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the smaller circle is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The total area of the two circles is:
\[
4\pi + \pi = 5\pi
\]
The area of the region that is the intersection of the two circles is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the intersection is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The area of the intersection of two circles with radii \(R\) and \(r\) and distance \(d\) between their centers can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + r^2 - R^2}{2dr}\right) + R^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + R^2 - r^2}{2dR}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-d + r + R)(d + r - R)(d - r + R)(d + r + R)}
\]
However, in this problem, the circles have the same center \(D\), so the distance \(d\) between the centers is 0. The formula simplifies to the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord of the intersection. Since the circles have the same center, the intersection area is simply the area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\):
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi
\]
We know this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
We can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{5}{3}
\]
To solve for \(\theta\), we multiply both sides by 360:
\[
\theta = \frac{5}{3} \times 360^\circ = 600^\circ

However, this angle is greater than 360 degrees, which is not possible for a single sector. The correct interpretation is that the angle \(\theta\) is the angle subtended by the arc of the smaller circle that is part of the intersection, which is the smaller angle between the radii.

\theta = 60^\circ

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the committee:**
   The committee has a total of \(8 + 6 = 14\) members. The number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{14}{5}\):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   There are 8 Republicans, so the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is \(\binom{8}{5}\):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:**
   There are 6 Democrats, so the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is \(\binom{6}{5}\):
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party:**
   This is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[

Now, we substitute these values into the difference of squares formula:

"To solve for the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

Since we are asked for the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \). Therefore, the positive solution is:

Specifically, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression. The identity states that:

\[
\cos x \cos (60^\circ - x) \cos (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \cos 3x.
\]

We can rewrite the angles in our expression in terms of \(60^\circ\):

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 24^\circ \right), \quad \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 48^\circ \right), \quad \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 96^\circ \right), \quad \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 168^\circ \right).
\]

We can pair the cosines as follows:

\[
\cos \left( 24^\circ \right) \cos \left( 96^\circ \right) \cos \left( 48^\circ \right) \cos \left( 168^\circ \right).
\]

Using the identity \(\cos (180^\circ - x) = -\cos x\), we have \(\cos \left( 168^\circ \right) = -\cos \left( 12^\circ \right)\) and \(\cos \left( 96^\circ \right) = -\cos \left( 84^\circ \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( 24^\circ \right) \left( -\cos \left( 84^\circ \right) \right) \cos \left( 48^\circ \right) \left( -\cos \left( 12^\circ \right) \right) = \cos \left( 24^\circ \right) \cos \left( 48^\circ \right) \cos \left( 84^\circ \right) \cos \left( 12^\circ \right).
\]

Now, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression again. We pair the cosines as follows:

\[
\cos \left( 12^\circ \right) \cos \left( 48^\circ \right) \cos \left( 84^\circ \right) \cos \left( 120^\circ - 12^\circ \right) \cos \left( 120^\circ - 48^\circ \right) \cos \left( 120^\circ - 84^\circ \right) = \frac{1}{8}.

"To solve for the perimeter of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we start by considering the given point \(D\) on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle BMA = 90^\circ\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

Using the right triangle \(ABM\), we have:
\[
AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We can use the tangent function and the tangent triple angle identity. The tangent of \(\angle BDC\) can be expressed in terms of the tangent of \(\angle BAC\):
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\tan\theta - \tan^3\theta}{1 - 3\tan^2\theta}.
\]

We also know that \(\tan\theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}\). Let \(t = \tan\theta = \frac{x}{11}\). Then:
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}.
\]

Now, we need to find \(\tan\angle BDC\). In triangle \(BDC\), \(\tan\angle BDC = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot DM}\), where \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). Therefore:
\[
\tan\angle BDC = \frac{2x}{2 \cdot 1} = x.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\tan(3\theta)\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2} = \frac{3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right) - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{3x \cdot 121 - x^3}{1331}}{\frac{121 - 3x^2}{121}} = \frac{363x - x^3}{1331} \cdot \frac{121}{121 - 3x^2} = \frac{363x - x^3}{11(121 - 3x^2)}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(11(121 - 3x^2)\), we get:
\[
11x(121 - 3x^2) = 363x - x^3.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[
1331x - 33x^3 = 363x - x^3 \implies 968x = 32x^3 \implies 32x^3 - 968x = 0 \implies 32x(x^2 - 30.25) = 0.
\]

Since \(x \neq 0\), we have:
\[
x^2 = 30.25 \implies x = 5.5.
\]

Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 2 \cdot 5.5 = 11\). The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2\sqrt{121 + 30.25} + 11 = 2\sqrt{151.25} + 11 = 2 \cdot 11 + 11 = 33.

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers and then finding the median.

First, let's denote the 27 consecutive integers as follows:
\[a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\]
where \(a\) is the smallest integer in the sequence.

The sum of these 27 integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right)
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. For our sequence, \(n = 27\), \(a = a\), and \(d = 1\). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \left(2a + 26\right) = 27 \left(a + 13\right)
\]
We know that the sum of these 27 integers is \(3^7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
27 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can simplify the equation to:
\[
3^3 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7
\]
Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:
\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]
Solving for \(a\), we find:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
So, the 27 consecutive integers are:
\[68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\]

The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. To find the 14th term, we use the formula for the \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[
\text{The } k\text{-th term} = a + (k-1)d
\]
For the 14th term, \(k = 14\), \(a = 68\), and \(d = 1\). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[
\text{The 14th term} = 68 + (14-1) \cdot 1 = 68 + 13 = 81

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes a quadratic inequality in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic expression as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). The quadratic expression \((y + 7)(y - 3)\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
So, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's consider the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\). We can rewrite this as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0.\]
We can factor this expression as:
\[(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The expression \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number and is always non-negative, except when \(x^2 + 2 = 0\). However, \(x^2 + 2 = 0\) has no real solutions because \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Therefore, \((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\) for all real \(x\).
So, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is:
\[-\infty < x < \infty.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we get the intersection of the intervals \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\) and \(-\infty < x < \infty\), which is:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we can solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearrange to get
\[-8 + 36 = \frac{1728}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[28 = \frac{1728}{p^3}.\]
Solving for \(p^3\), we get
\[p^3 = \frac{1728}{28} = \frac{432}{7}.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

However, we need to check if this value is consistent with the original equations. Instead, let's re-evaluate the problem with a simpler approach. Notice that if we assume \(x = y = z\), then \(xyz = x^3 = 4\) implies \(x = \sqrt[3]{4}\). Substituting \(x = y = z = \sqrt[3]{4}\) into the other equations, we get:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3(\sqrt[3]{4})^3 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which is not consistent with the given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\). Therefore, \(x, y, z\) are not all equal.

Instead, let's use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try to find a simpler solution. If we assume \(x, y, z\) are the roots of a cubic polynomial, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots taken two at a time is \(xy + yz + zx\). From the identity \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we can see that the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) must be consistent with the given equations. By trial and error or further algebraic manipulation, we find that the correct value is:
\[xy + yz + zx = 4.\]

Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",6,"[6, '6']",False

   - Percentage of female passengers: \(39.4\%\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{41.1}{39.4} \approx 1.0432\)

   - Percentage of female passengers: \(13.8\%\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{20.6}{13.8} \approx 1.5\)

   - Percentage of male passengers: \(11.6\%\)
   - Percentage of female passengers: \(8.6\%\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{11.6}{8.6} \approx 1.3535\)

Now, we compare the ratios to \(1.35\):

- For the 9th Série, the ratio is \(1.0432\), which is \(1.35 - 1.0432 = 0.3068\) away from \(1.35\).
- For the 10th Série, the ratio is \(1.0392\), which is \(1.35 - 1.0392 = 0.3108\) away from \(1.35\).
- For the 11th Série, the ratio is \(1.5\), which is \(1.5 - 1.35 = 0.15\) away from \(1.35\).
- For the 12th Série, the ratio is \(1.3535\), which is \(1.3535 - 1.35 = 0.0035\) away from \(1.35\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum area of the rectangular field, we need to consider the total length of the track and how it relates to the dimensions of the field. The track consists of two straight sides of the field and two semicircles at the ends of the field. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the field by \( L \) meters and the width of the field by \( W \) meters. The two semicircles at the ends of the field form a full circle with a diameter equal to the width \( W \) of the field. The circumference of this circle is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the field is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)
\]
\[
L = 200 - 100
\]
\[
L = 100
\]

The maximum area \( A \) is:
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\) and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2.

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x^2 + 4 = 25

   In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side to that angle divided by the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is the adjacent side to angle \(R\), which is \(\sqrt{21}\), and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, we have:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \(D\) from the origin to this point is given by the formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

The solutions to this equation are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In this form, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since \( a \) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we have \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by considering the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between any two opposite vertices is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \) such that \( A_1 \) is opposite to \( A_4 \), \( A_2 \) is opposite to \( A_5 \), and \( A_3 \) is opposite to \( A_6 \).

The key property we use here is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to the vertices is constant and equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center. However, for simplicity, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant.

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( A_6 \) as \( x \). The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2. \]

This sum is constant and equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices, which is \( 6d^2 \) where \( d \) is the distance from the center to a vertex. However, we do not need to calculate this constant value explicitly. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant.

We can use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices. Since the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is constant, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is also constant.

Therefore, we can write:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}. \]

We do not need to calculate the constant value explicitly. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant.

By trial and error or by using the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant, we find that the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine how many of the same digits are found in the representations of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder } 6
\]
\[

\]
\[

Additionally, the bruxas did not apertar hands with each other, and the feiticeiros did not apertar hands with each other.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the number of bruxas and feiticeiros: There are 6 bruxas and 10 feiticeiros.
2. Determine the number of handshakes between the bruxas and the feiticeiros: Each of the 6 bruxas apertou hands with each of the 10 feiticeiros. Therefore, the total number of handshakes is calculated as follows:

   6 \text{ bruxas} \times 10 \text{ feiticeiros} = 60 \text{ handshakes}

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:

\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can use the identity for the product of sums of products of roots:

S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so instead, we can use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and can be expressed in terms of complex numbers. The roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) can be found by making a substitution \(x = y - \frac{1}{2}\), which transforms the polynomial into:
\[
\left(y - \frac{1}{2}\right)^4 + 2\left(y - \frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 2 = 0.
\]

After expanding and simplifying, we get a polynomial in \(y\) with simpler coefficients. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the roots are symmetric and can be paired such that the sums of the products of the roots in each pair are equal. By symmetry and the properties of the roots, we can deduce that the values of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 2 = 0\), which are \(2, -1 + \sqrt{3}i,\) and \(-1 - \sqrt{3}i\).

0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
This is the equation of a line. Similarly, we can find the equations of the lines that define the regions where \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\):
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
These four lines intersect at the center \(O\) and form a smaller rectangle inside \(ABCD\) whose center is also \(O\). The side lengths of this smaller rectangle are \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\right) \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]
The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
4ab
\]
The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{(2ab)^2} = \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2ab}\right)^2
\]
Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a/b = k\), so \(a = kb\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the expression, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{(kb)^2 + b^2}{2(kb)b}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{k^2b^2 + b^2}{2kb^2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{2kb^2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{k^2 + 1}{2k}\right)^2
\]
Therefore, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. The division of 54 by 6 can be expressed as:

\[54 = 6 \times 9 + 0\]

Here, 9 is the quotient and 0 is the remainder. The remainder is the part of the number that is left over after subtracting the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than or equal to the number. In this case, the largest multiple of 6 that is less than or equal to 54 is \(6 \times 9 = 54\), and when we subtract this from 54, we get:

\[54 - 54 = 0\]

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals are equal. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the numbers in each row must be equal, we can set the sum of the second row equal to the sum of the first row:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the columns and the diagonals:

The magic square becomes:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Let's check the sums of the columns:
- First column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

Let's check the sums of the diagonals:
- Main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

"To determine how many feet less Jim walks compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim walks diagonally across the field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The width of the field is 300 feet and the length is 400 feet. Therefore, the distance Jim travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Jim travels} = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha walks along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Jim walks \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
