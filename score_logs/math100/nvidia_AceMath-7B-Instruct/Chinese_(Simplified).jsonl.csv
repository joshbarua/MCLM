"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\).

Given:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
and
\[
EF = 7
\]
we can substitute these values into the equation to find \(DF\):
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, \(EF\) is one leg, and \(DE\) is the other leg. Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}i}{2} + \frac{6\sqrt{2}i^2}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For this term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
5k = 15 \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We know that \(\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10\), so the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

We can factorize the quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we need to find the sum \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for all two-dimensional vectors \( \bold{v} \), the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds, we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Solving the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number satisfying \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to compute the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can see that:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of one squig.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find how many treeks weigh the same as one squig. To do this, we will eliminate \( G \) from the equations. First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides:
\[
12T = 4S
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[

\[
S = 3T

This equation tells us that one squig weighs the same as three treeks. Therefore, the number of treeks that weigh the same as one squig is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its piecewise definition.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The vertex of this parabola is at \(x = a\), and the value of the function at the vertex is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

- If \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards, and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y \geq a^3\).
- If \(a < 0\), the parabola opens downwards, and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y \leq a^3\).

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). The value of the function at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the line has a positive slope, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y < a^2 + 2a\).
- If \(a < 0\), the line has a negative slope, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(\infty\). Therefore, the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) will intersect every horizontal line \(y > a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Ensure the function intersects every horizontal line at least once
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) must together cover all real numbers. This means that the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).
  \[
  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0
  \]
  \[
  a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0
  \]
  \[
  a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0
  \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \in [-1, 0] \cup [2, \infty)\). Since \(a > 0\), we have \(a \in [2, \infty)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\) and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, we need \(a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a\).
  \[
  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0
  \]
  \[
  a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0
  \]
  \[
  a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0
  \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]\). Since \(a < 0\), we have \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\).

The maximum value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[ 0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1. \]
Since \(\lambda > 0\), the inequality \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) simplifies to:
\[ \lambda - 1 \ge 0, \]
\[ \lambda \ge 1. \]
The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is always true for \(\lambda > 0\). Therefore, the fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by finding \(f(f(x))\):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
Let \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:
\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]
Since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(x = \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)}\) into \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\):
\[ y = \lambda \left( \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y}{1 - y} \left( \frac{\lambda (1 - y) - y}{\lambda (1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y (\lambda - \lambda y - y)}{\lambda (1 - y)^2} = \frac{y (\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y)}{\lambda (1 - y)^2}. \]
For this to hold, we need:
\[ y \lambda (1 - y)^2 = y (\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y). \]
Assuming \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):
\[ \lambda (1 - y)^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y. \]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ \lambda (1 - 2y + y^2) = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda - 2\lambda y + \lambda y^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda y^2 - 2\lambda y + (\lambda + 1)y = 0, \]
\[ y (\lambda y - 2\lambda + \lambda + 1) = 0, \]
\[ y (\lambda y - \lambda + 1) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ y = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]
If \(y = 0\), then \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point. If \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then:

\[ x(1 - x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda^2}, \]
\[ x^2 - x + \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda^2} = 0. \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
\[ 1 - 4 \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 4}{\lambda^2} = \frac{(\lambda - 2)^2}{\lambda^2}. \]
For the quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative, which is always true. The solutions are:
\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \frac{\lambda - 2}{\lambda}}{2} = \frac{\lambda \pm (\lambda - 2)}{2\lambda}. \]

"To find the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) such that

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we can further simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression matches the tangent of a specific angle. By trial and error or using known values, we find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) is:

"To determine the number of different ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word contains repeated letters. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E, where the letter E appears twice and the letter L appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S is 1 each, so \( n_3 = n_4 = n_5 = 1 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{5040}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260

Therefore, the number of different ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is \(\boxed{1260}\).","[1260, '1260']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",True
"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42.
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 multiples of 5.

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42.
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
   So, there is 1 multiple of 25.

3. Count the multiples of 125 in the range from 1 to 42.
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
   So, there are no multiples of 125.

Since higher powers of 5 will also contribute factors of 5, but there are no multiples of 125 in the range, we stop here.

Adding up all the factors of 5, we get:
\[
8 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. First, evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Finally, evaluate \( g \) at the result from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we move to the second step. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Finally, we evaluate \( g(6) \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

其中，\(\mathbf{r_1}\) 和 \(\mathbf{r_2}\) 是两条直线的参数方程中的常数向量，\(\mathbf{d_1}\) 和 \(\mathbf{d_2}\) 是直线的方向向量。

首先，我们有两条直线的参数方程：

1. 第一条直线：
   \[
   \mathbf{r_1}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}

2. 第二条直线：
   \[
   \mathbf{r_2}(u) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}

   这里，\(\mathbf{r_2} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) 和 \(\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\)。

接下来，我们计算向量 \(\mathbf{r_1} - \mathbf{r_2}\)：
\[
\mathbf{r_1} - \mathbf{r_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 5 \\ -10 + 3 \\ 1 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

然后，我们计算方向向量的叉积 \(\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2}\)：
\[
\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(36 - 36) - \mathbf{j}(-8 + 8) + \mathbf{k}(-36 + 36) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

由于 \(\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\)，说明两条直线的方向向量是平行的，因此两条直线是平行的。

接下来，我们计算向量的点积 \((\mathbf{r_1} - \mathbf{r_2}) \cdot (\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2})\)：
\[
(\mathbf{r_1} - \mathbf{r_2}) \cdot (\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2}) = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

由于 \((\mathbf{r_1} - \mathbf{r_2}) \cdot (\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2}) = 0\)，两条直线之间的距离 \(d\) 为：
\[
d = \frac{|0|}{|\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2}|} = 0

"To find the number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4)\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle**: 
   - The rectangle extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\).
   - The width of the rectangle is \(5 - (-5) = 10\) units.
   - The height of the rectangle is \(4 - (-4) = 8\) units.

2. **Calculate the total area of the rectangle**:
   - The area \(A\) can be calculated using the formula:

3. **Determine the number of integer points**:
   - The integer points in a rectangle can be found by considering the integer coordinates within the bounds of the rectangle.
   - The integer \(x\) values range from \(-5\) to \(5\), which gives us \(5 - (-5) + 1 = 11\) integer points in the \(x\)-direction.

"To find the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we need to analyze the given information and use the properties of circles and sectors.

1. **Identify the areas of the circles:**
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \(1\).
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\).
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\).

2. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   - The shaded region is part of the larger circle and part of the smaller circle.
   - The total area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   - Therefore, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

3. **Calculate the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   - Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians.
   - The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta\).

4. **Calculate the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   - The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

5. **Set up the equation for the total area of the shaded region:**
   - The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the sectors of the larger and smaller circles.
   - Therefore, we have \(2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).
   - Combine the terms on the left side: \(2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}\).
   - So, the equation is \(\frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

6. **Solve for \(\theta\):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{5}\): \(\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}\).

7. **Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:**
   - Since \(\pi\) radians is \(180^\circ\), \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians is \(\frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 120^\circ\).

Therefore, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",120,"[120, '120']",True
"To determine how many cylindrical burners are needed to fill a spherical water tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical burners and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical burner. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical burner, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical water tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

Now, to find out how many cylindrical burners are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical burner:
\[ \text{Number of burners} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical burners needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"To determine the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that each party must have at least one member, we can follow these steps:

\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Next, factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, 3)\). Thus, the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, define \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[-4 < y^2 + 4y.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The root of the equation \((y + 2)^2 = 0\) is \(y = -2\). This root divides the real number line into two intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\) and \((-2, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -2)\), choose \(y = -3\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-3 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((- \infty, -2)\).

2. For \(y \in (-2, \infty)\), choose \(y = -1\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-1 + 2)^2 = (1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-2, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) is \((-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, \infty)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we restrict the solution to \([0, \infty)\). Thus, the solution to \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is:
\[x \in \mathbb{R}.\]

Finally, we find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.\]","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True
"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use the identity for the sum of cubes and some algebraic manipulation.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this expression in terms of symmetric sums:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the equation, we get
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
\[24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

To eliminate \(x+y+z\), we can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(xy + yz + zx\) and \(x+y+z\):
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).\]

However, a simpler approach is to solve the system directly. From the second equation, we can express \(x+y+z\) in terms of \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[x+y+z = \frac{24}{xy + yz + zx}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = \frac{24}{xy + yz + zx} \left(\left(\frac{24}{xy + yz + zx}\right)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).\]

This equation is quite complex, so let's assume a simpler solution. If we test the values \(x = y = z = \sqrt[3]{4}\), we find that they satisfy all three equations. For these values, we have
\[xy + yz + zx = 3(\sqrt[3]{4})^2 = 3 \cdot 4^{2/3}.\]

However, the correct approach is to solve the system directly, and the correct value is found to be:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

The solutions to \( f'(x) = 0 \) are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Here, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[ a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f(3) = 0 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution is \( x = 3 \). So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f(-3) = 6 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. Therefore, \( f(2) = 6 \).

From the above, the solutions are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). Since \( x \leq 3 \) for the first solution and \( x > 3 \) for the second solution, we have \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5

"To determine how many digits are common between the seven-digit and eight-digit representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We list the digits of each representation:

- Base 7 digits: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8 digits: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

We identify the common digits between the two sets:

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). We can use the substitution \(y = x + \frac{1}{x}\) to simplify the equation. First, we rewrite the polynomial as:

\[x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0.\]

Dividing through by \(x^2\) (assuming \(x \neq 0\)), we get:

\[x^2 + 2x + 2 + \frac{2}{x^2} = 0.\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[x^2 + \frac{2}{x^2} + 2x + 2 = 0.\]

Now, let \(y = x + \frac{1}{x}\). Then, \(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[y^2 - 2 + 2 = 0,\]
\[y^2 = 0,\]
\[y = 0.\]

So, \(x + \frac{1}{x} = 0\), which implies \(x^2 + 1 = 0\), or \(x^2 = -1\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = i\) and \(x = -i\). Since the polynomial is of degree 4, each root must have multiplicity 2. Thus, the roots of the polynomial are \(i, i, -i, -i\).

Now, we need to determine the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's consider all possible pairings of the roots:

   \[
   \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = i \cdot (-i) + i \cdot (-i) = 1 + 1 = 2.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Assume the center \(O\) is at the origin \((0,0)\), and the vertices are \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The condition \(AB/AD = k\) implies that the length of \(AB\) is \(2a\) and the length of \(AD\) is \(2b\), so \(k = \frac{a}{b}\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if its distance to \(O\) is less than its distance to any vertex. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the distances to the other vertices:
- For \(B\): \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For \(C\): \(-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
- For \(D\): \(-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

These four inequalities define a smaller rectangle inside the original rectangle \(ABCD\). The vertices of this smaller rectangle are the points where the lines intersect. Solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the smaller rectangle are:

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:

"To determine the remainder of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to follow these steps:

- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how many cents are left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie combine their earnings and exchange the total amount for paper money, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money earned by all four individuals.
2. Convert the total amount from dollars to cents.
3. Determine the number of cents left after exchanging the total amount for paper money.

First, let's find the total amount of money earned by all four individuals:
\[
\text{Linda's earnings} = \$27.47

\[
\text{Sherry's earnings} = \$35.23
\]
\[
\text{June's earnings} = \$37.37

\[

Adding these amounts together:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money earned is \$126.59.

Next, we convert this total amount from dollars to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

When the total amount is exchanged for paper money, the largest paper bill is a \$100 bill, which is equivalent to 10000 cents. Therefore, after exchanging the total amount for paper money, the remaining amount will be the total amount in cents minus the largest multiple of 10000 that is less than or equal to the total amount in cents. In this case, the largest multiple of 10000 that is less than or equal to 12659 is 10000. So, the remaining amount is:

12659 - 10000 = 2659 \text{ cents}
\]

Thus, the number of cents left after exchanging the total amount for paper money is \(\boxed{2659}\).","[2659, '2659']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"要计算这次考试的班级平均分，我们需要按照以下步骤进行：

1. **计算总分**：将每个分数段的学生人数与其分数相乘，然后将这些乘积相加。

   - 20名学生得了80分，总分为 \(20 \times 80 = 1600\)。
   - 8名学生得了90分，总分为 \(8 \times 90 = 720\)。
   - 2名学生得了100分，总分为 \(2 \times 100 = 200\)。

   将这些总分相加得到总的分数：
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

2. **计算平均分**：将总的分数除以学生的总数。

   - 学生总数为30人。

   因此，平均分计算为：
   \[
   \text{平均分} = \frac{\text{总的分数}}{\text{学生总数}} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84
   \]

所以，这次考试的班级平均分是 \(\boxed{84}\)。","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

### Step 3: Verify the solution by calculating the sums of the other rows, columns, and diagonals
Now that we have \( n = 7 \), let's substitute \( n \) back into the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

#### Sum of the first column:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the second column:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the third column:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

#### Sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

\text{To find out how much less Jim walks compared to Martha, we first need to calculate the distances each of them travels.}
\]

\[
\text{1. Calculate the distance Jim travels:}
\]
\[
\text{Jim travels along the diagonal of the rectangle. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with width \(w\) and length \(l\) is given by:}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{w^2 + l^2}
\]
\[
\text{Here, the width \(w = 300\) feet and the length \(l = 400\) feet. Plugging in these values:}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{90000 + 160000}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{250000}
\]
\[
= 500 \text{ feet}
\]

\[
\text{2. Calculate the distance Martha travels:}
\]
\[
\text{Martha walks along the perimeter of the rectangle, which is the sum of the lengths of the two sides:}
\]
\[
\text{Distance} = w + l = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

\[
\text{3. Now, find the difference in distance between Martha and Jim:}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance Martha} - \text{Distance Jim} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

\[
\text{Thus, Jim walks 200 feet less than Martha.}
