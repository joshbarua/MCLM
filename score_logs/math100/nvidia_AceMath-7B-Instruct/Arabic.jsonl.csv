"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\).

Given:
\[
\sin D = 0.7 = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]
we can substitute \(EF = 7\) into the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{6i}{2} + i^2\frac{6i}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.
   \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Now, we use the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
   \]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rose, and Thomas) sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the 3 specific people as a single ""block"" or ""super person"".** This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

2. **Arrange the 3 specific people within their block.** There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange Pierre, Rose, and Thomas within their block.

3. **Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" by the number of ways to arrange the 3 specific people within their block.** This gives us \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \).

Thus, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rose, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(4)(6)(8) \pmod{7}
\]
Next, reduce each term modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
(4)(6)(1) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
24 \pmod{7}
\]
Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]
So:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise around its center to match its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

Here are the steps to find the answer:

1. Identify the total degrees in a full rotation: \(360^\circ\).
2. Determine the number of equal parts the full rotation is divided into for a regular pentagon: 5.
3. Calculate the degrees of each part: \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid either. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) where \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula with \(2\cos A\):

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we factor it first:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero, we get:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]

This gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we add \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

We use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this in, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one trick and one golf ball in terms of the weight of a standard golf ball. Let's denote the weight of one trick as \( T \) and the weight of one golf ball as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. Ten tricks and one golf ball weigh the same as three standard golf balls and one golf ball.
2. Two tricks and one golf ball weigh the same as one standard golf ball.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( 10T + G = 3G + G \)
2. \( 2T + G = G \)

Let's simplify these equations step by step.

First, simplify the first equation:
\[ 10T + G = 4G \]
Subtract \( G \) from both sides:
\[ 10T = 3G \]
Divide both sides by 10:
\[ T = \frac{3G}{10} \]

Now, simplify the second equation:
\[ 2T + G = G \]
Subtract \( G \) from both sides:
\[ 2T = 0 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ T = 0 \]

However, the second equation seems incorrect because it implies that the weight of one trick is zero, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the equations.

The correct interpretation should be that the weight of one trick is equal to the weight of one standard golf ball. Therefore, the correct weight of one trick is \( T = G \).

Now, we need to find the weight of one trick that is equal to the weight of one standard golf ball. The correct answer is:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\):
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\):
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\):
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
   \]
   This is true.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), which must equal \(6\):
   \[

   This is true.

Since all the coefficients match, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the water in the tank. Since the tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, the rate of change of the volume \(V\) with respect to time \(t\) is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The rate of change of the height \(h\) with respect to time \(t\) is given as 4 meters per hour, so:

\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

We can use the chain rule to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height. Differentiating the volume formula with respect to time, we get:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we have:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \(4\pi\):

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) defined piecewise:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first piece \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x \geq a \).
2. **Behavior**: Since \( a \) is a constant, the function \( ax^2 \) is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).
3. **Minimum/Maximum**: 
   - If \( a > 0 \), the minimum value occurs at \( x = a \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]
   - If \( a < 0 \), the maximum value occurs at \( x = a \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]

### Step 2: Analyze the second piece \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x < a \).
2. **Behavior**: This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \).
3. **Value at \( x = a \)**: The value of the function as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left is:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
   \]

### Step 3: Determine the intersection with horizontal lines

To ensure that every horizontal line intersects the graph of \( f(x) \) at least once, we need to analyze the range of \( f(x) \).

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - The minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( a^3 \).
   - The value of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left is \( a^2 + 2a \).
   - The range of \( f(x) \) for \( x < a \) is \( (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \).
   - The range of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( [a^3, \infty) \).
   - For every horizontal line to intersect the graph, we need:
     \[
     a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.
     \]
   - Factoring out \( a \):
     \[
     a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.
     \]
   - Factoring the quadratic:
     \[
     a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.
     \]
   - The roots are \( a = 0, 2, -1 \). Testing intervals gives:
     - \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2] \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - The maximum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( a^3 \).
   - The value of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left is \( a^2 + 2a \).
   - The range of \( f(x) \) for \( x < a \) is \( (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \).
   - The range of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( (-\infty, a^3] \).
   - For every horizontal line to intersect the graph, we need:
     \[
     a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a.
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0.
     \]
   - This is the same inequality as before, but we need to consider the negative values of \( a \).

### Conclusion

The largest value of \( a \) that satisfies the condition for \( a > 0 \) is \( a = 2 \). For \( a < 0 \), the analysis does not yield a larger value since \( a^3 \) will always be less than \( a^2 + 2a \) for negative \( a \).

Thus, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once is:

"To find the value of \( c \) that makes the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) that makes the circle have a radius of 1 is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x (1 - x). \]

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:

\[ \lambda x (1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x (\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

The fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)). We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(x\) is not a fixed point but satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x (1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x (1 - x)) (1 - \lambda x (1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x (1 - x) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2). \]

We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:

\[ \lambda^2 x (1 - x) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 x (1 - x) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0, \]
\[ x (\lambda^2 (1 - x) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0. \]

This gives us two cases:

1. \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point.
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

We need to solve the second equation for \(x \neq 0\):

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 = 1. \]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[ -\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that this cubic equation has a root \(x \in [0,1]\) that is not a fixed point. We already know that \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) are fixed points, so we need to check if the cubic equation has a root in \([0,1]\) that is not \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the function and its properties, we find that the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are \(\lambda = 2\) and \(\lambda = 4\). For these values, the cubic equation has a root in \([0,1]\) that is not a fixed point.

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) are:

"To find the measure of the positive angle \(\theta\) that satisfies the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\).

The given expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:
\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these formulas, we can rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Similarly, we can rewrite the denominator as:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).

Applying these identities, we get:

\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ (-\sin 30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Therefore, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The positive angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the product.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by the powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, it can be shown that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} \).

Thus,

\[ 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is:

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and using properties of the centroid and similar triangles.

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of triangle \( ABC \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Determine the area of triangle \( AGC \):**
   Since the centroid divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area, the area of triangle \( AGC \) is one-third of the area of triangle \( ABC \). Given that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AGC \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AGC = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48
   \]

3. **Determine the area of triangle \( EGC \):**
   Since \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), \( AE = EC \). The line segment \( EG \) is parallel to \( BC \) and divides triangle \( AGC \) into two smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \( EGC \) is half of the area of triangle \( AGC \):
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle EGC = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]

4. **Determine the area of triangle \( ENG \):**
   Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through the centroid \( G \), triangles \( ENG \) and \( EGC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the median, which is 2:1. Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles \( ENG \) and \( EGC \) is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \times \text{Area of } \triangle EGC = \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6

"To determine for which positive integer \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} = k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of \( 24 \).

First, we list the divisors of \( 24 \). The number \( 24 \) can be factored as \( 24 = 2^3 \times 3 \). The divisors of \( 24 \) are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Thus, the positive integer \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power is any of the divisors of \( 24 \) except \( 1 \). The largest such \( n \) is \( 24 \).

"To determine the number of nickel coins Hillary has, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things from the problem:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \) (since each dime is worth 10 cents and each nickel is worth 5 cents)

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we'll solve the first equation for \( d \):
\[ d = 11 - n \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 10(11 - n) + 5n = 75 \]

Now, we distribute the 10:
\[ 110 - 10n + 5n = 75 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 110 - 5n = 75 \]

Subtract 110 from both sides:
\[ -5n = 75 - 110 \]
\[ -5n = -35 \]

Divide both sides by -5:
\[ n = \frac{-35}{-5} \]
\[ n = 7 \]

So, Hillary has 7 nickels. To verify, we can find the number of dimes by substituting \( n = 7 \) back into the equation \( d = 11 - n \):
\[ d = 11 - 7 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now, we check the total value:
\[ 10d + 5n = 10(4) + 5(7) = 40 + 35 = 75 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of nickel coins Hillary has is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"الSix first prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

To find the probability that the sum of the two randomly chosen prime numbers is even, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the numbers.

1. **Identify the parity of the prime numbers:**
   - 2 is the only even prime number.
   - The other five primes (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd.

2. **Determine the combinations for the sum to be even:**
   - The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd.
   - Since there is only one even prime (2), the only way to have both numbers even is to choose 2 twice.
   - The other option is to choose two odd primes.

3. **Count the total combinations:**
   - There are 6 prime numbers in total.
   - The total number of ways to choose 2 primes from 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \):
     \[
     \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
     \]

4. **Count the successful combinations:**
   - **Case 1: Both numbers are even.**
     - The only way to choose both numbers as even is to choose 2 twice. This gives us 1 combination.
   - **Case 2: Both numbers are odd.**
     - There are 5 odd primes (3, 5, 7, 11, 13). The number of ways to choose 2 odd primes from these 5 is:
     \[
     \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10

5. **Total successful combinations:**
   - Total successful combinations = Combinations of both even + Combinations of both odd:
   \[
   1 + 10 = 11

6. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability that the sum is even is given by the ratio of successful combinations to total combinations:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the individual shaded triangles.

The diagram shows a grid of 12 unit squares, each with a side length of 1 unit. The shaded region consists of two triangles. Let's identify these triangles and calculate their areas step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Triangles
1. The first triangle is formed by the vertices \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The second triangle is formed by the vertices \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the First Triangle
The area \(A\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

For the first triangle:
- The base is the distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
- The height is the distance between \((0, 4)\) and the x-axis, which is 4 units.

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Second Triangle
For the second triangle:
- The base is the distance between \((3, 0)\) and \((3, 0)\), which is 3 units.
- The height is the distance between \((0, 4)\) and the x-axis, which is 4 units.

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Area of the Shaded Region
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to its decimal form.

First, calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

Next, perform the division:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605\]

Now, identify the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Sum these digits:
\[2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14\]

Therefore, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True

\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \), so \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Since the roots of \( f(x) \) sum to 49, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5 \), \( r_2 - 5 \), and \( r_3 - 5 \), where \( r_1 \), \( r_2 \), and \( r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]
Next, recall the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + 2 + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Now, we need to find the values of \(\sec^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use known trigonometric values and identities to simplify the expression directly.

Consider the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ - x)} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ + x)} = \frac{9}{4}.
\]
For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = \frac{9}{4}.
\]
However, we need \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). We can use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = \frac{9}{4}.

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Determine the measure of the missing interior angle:**
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all interior angles of the polygon is \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Find the range for \(x\):**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0 < x < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Estimate the value of \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the approximate value of \(n\) by assuming \(x\) is close to 0. If \(x\) were 0, the sum of all interior angles would be \(1070^\circ\). So, we solve:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 180:
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070}{180} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n \approx 7.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we test \(n = 7\) and \(n = 8\).

6. **Check \(n = 7\):**
   If \(n = 7\), the sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   The missing angle \(x\) would be:
   \[
   x = 900^\circ - 1070^\circ = -170^\circ
   \]
   This is not possible because \(x\) must be positive.

7. **Check \(n = 8\):**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   The missing angle \(x\) would be:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   This is possible because \(0 < x < 180^\circ\).

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test the values from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[ 1^2 = 1, \quad 2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 6^2 = 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}, \quad 7^2 = 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \quad 8^2 = 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 9^2 = 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \quad 10^2 = 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \quad 11^2 = 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}. \]
Thus, the modular square root of 2 modulo 23 is 5. Therefore, we have:
\[ t = -1 \pm 5. \]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4, \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and \( t = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:
\[ \boxed{17}. \]","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True

   The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \(s\) is the length of a side. Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic foot, we have:

Next, we need to multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[

For our sequence, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},

which simplifies to

\[

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Thus, the distance between the two lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with a width of \(10\) units (from \(-5\) to \(5\)) and a height of \(8\) units (from \(-4\) to \(4\)).

2. **Determine the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values for points inside the rectangle:**
   For a point \((x,y)\) to be strictly inside the rectangle, its \(x\)-coordinate must satisfy \(-5 < x < 5\) and its \(y\)-coordinate must satisfy \(-4 < y < 4\).

3. **Count the integer values within these ranges:**
   - The integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are \(9\) such values.
   - The integer values for \(y\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). There are \(7\) such values.

4. **Calculate the total number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle:**
   Since each \(x\)-value can pair with each \(y\)-value, the total number of points is the product of the number of \(x\)-values and the number of \(y\)-values:
   \[
   9 \times 7 = 63

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{z}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times (\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{z} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{z}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Now, we substitute the given values for \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the quadrilateral \(ABCD\). We know that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Additionally, the area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). The area of the trapezoid can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\). Let \(CD = h\).

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h.
\]

We also know that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the base of \(\triangle ABC\) is \(BC = b\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h.
\]

The total area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h.
\]

We already know that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42.
\]

Since \(h = CD\), we can substitute \(h\) in the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h.
\]

To find \(a \times h\), we use the fact that \(h = \frac{84}{a + b}\). However, we can also use the property that the areas of the triangles are proportional to their bases because they share the same height. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have equal areas. Therefore:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**

   2x \cdot 4 = 9 \cdot (3x-1)

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

5. **Verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:**
   The original equation is:

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points and pair them:**
   - There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a sequence.
   - Each arrangement corresponds to a unique way of pairing the points into two line segments. For example, the arrangement \(ABCD\) corresponds to the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\), and the arrangement \(ADCB\) corresponds to the line segments \(AD\) and \(CB\).

2. **Determine the number of arrangements where the line segments intersect:**
   - The line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if the points are arranged as \(ACBD\), \(ADBC\), \(BACD\), \(BADC\), \(CABD\), \(CADB\), \(CBAD\), or \(CBDA\).
   - There are 8 such arrangements.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is \(2\). The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is \(1\). The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

3. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   The problem states that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region \(A_{\text{shaded}}\) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Identify the components of the shaded area:**
   The shaded area consists of the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the larger sector is:
   \[
   A_{\text{large sector}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
   \]
   The area of the smaller sector is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small sector}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{large sector}} - A_{\text{small sector}} = 2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2}
   \]

5. **Set up the equation and solve for \(\theta\):**
   We know that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   To solve for \(\theta\), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{2}{3}\):
   \[
   \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{9}
   \]

6. **Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:**
   Since \(\pi\) radians is equal to \(180\) degrees, we convert \(\theta\) to degrees by multiplying by \(\frac{180}{\pi}\):
   \[
   \theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{10 \times 180}{9} = \frac{1800}{9} = 200

"To determine how many conical cups of water are needed to fill a hemispherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the conical cups and the hemispherical tank and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of one conical cup. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cone is:
\[ V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the conical cup, \( r = 3 \) cm and \( h = 8 \) cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 (8) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9) (8) = 24 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the hemispherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
Since the tank is a hemisphere, its volume is half of the volume of a full sphere. For the hemispherical tank, \( r = 6 \) cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{hemisphere}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 288 \pi \right) = 144 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, recall the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B
\]

Since \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\), we need to find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos^2 A = 1 - \sin^2 A = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84 \implies \cos A = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

\[
\cos^2 B = 1 - \sin^2 B = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \implies \cos B = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, substitute \(\sin A\), \(\sin B\), \(\cos A\), and \(\cos B\) into the formulas for \(\sin (A + B)\) and \(\sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin A = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}

Now, multiply \(\sin (A + B)\) and \(\sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}) \cdot \sqrt{21}}{100} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21}}{100} = \frac{2\sqrt{63} + 21}{100} = \frac{6\sqrt{7} + 21}{100}

1. **Total Ways to Choose 5 Members**: First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members (8 republicans + 6 democrats) without any restrictions. This can be calculated using the combination formula:

   \[
   \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}

   Here, \( n = 14 \) and \( k = 5 \):

2. **Ways to Choose All Republicans**: Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose all 5 members from the 8 republicans:

   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!}
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

3. **Ways to Choose All Democrats**: Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to choose all 5 members from the 6 democrats:

   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!}
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = 6

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):

"To find the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( D \) is on the altitude \( AM \), \( D \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( A \) to \( BC \) and \( AD = 10 \), so \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Next, we use the tangent function in \( \triangle BDC \) and \( \triangle BAC \). In \( \triangle BDC \),
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \tan 3\theta = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}.
\]
In \( \triangle BAC \),
\[
\tan \angle BAC = \tan \theta = \frac{BC}{2AB \cos \theta}.
\]
However, we can use the fact that \( \tan 3\theta = \frac{\sin 3\theta}{\cos 3\theta} \) and the double angle identities to find a relationship between \( \tan \theta \) and \( \tan 3\theta \).

Using the tangent addition formula for \( \tan 3\theta \),
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3 \tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta}.
\]
We know that \( \tan 3\theta = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot 10 \cos \theta} = \frac{BC}{20 \cos \theta} \) and \( \tan \theta = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot 11 \cos \theta} = \frac{BC}{22 \cos \theta} \).

Let \( \tan \theta = x \). Then \( \tan 3\theta = \frac{3x - x^3}{1 - 3x^2} \). Since \( \tan 3\theta = \frac{BC}{20 \cos \theta} \) and \( \tan \theta = \frac{BC}{22 \cos \theta} \), we have
\[
\frac{3x - x^3}{1 - 3x^2} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]
Solving this equation, we get \( x = \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( \tan \theta = \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, we can find \( BC \) and \( AB \). Since \( \tan \theta = \frac{BC}{22 \cos \theta} = \frac{1}{2} \), we have \( BC = 11 \). The length of \( AB \) is given by
\[

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is

\[
x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26
\]

The sum of these 27 integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

where \(n\) is the number of terms. In our case, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(x\), and the last term is \(x + 26\). Thus, the sum is:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \times (x + (x + 26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2x + 26) = 27 \times (x + 13)
\]

We know that this sum equals 2187:

\[
27 \times (x + 13) = 2187
\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 27:

\[
x + 13 = \frac{2187}{27}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
\frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
x + 13 = 81

Subtracting 13 from both sides gives:

To find the median of these 27 integers, we note that since the number of integers is odd (27), the median is the middle number. The middle number in a sequence of 27 integers is the 14th term.

The 14th term in our sequence can be calculated as:

"To find the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \)

First, observe that \( x^4 \) and \( 4x^2 \) are both non-negative for all real \( x \). Therefore, their sum \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) is also non-negative. Since \( -4 \) is negative, the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \) is always true for all real \( x \).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \)

Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes a quadratic inequality in terms of \( y \):
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21. \]
Rearrange this to standard form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0. \]
Next, factor the quadratic expression:
\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) < 0. \]
The roots of the equation \( (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \) are \( y = -7 \) and \( y = 3 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -7) \), \( (-7, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \( y \in (-\infty, -7) \), choose \( y = -8 \):
  \[ (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0. \]
  So, the inequality does not hold in this interval.

- For \( y \in (-7, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0. \]
  So, the inequality holds in this interval.

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0. \]
  So, the inequality does not hold in this interval.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is \( -7 < y < 3 \). Since \( y = x^2 \), we substitute back to get:
\[ -7 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \) is always non-negative, the inequality simplifies to:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

### Final Answer

Combining the results from both steps, we see that the values of \( x \) that satisfy the original inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) are:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearrange to get
\[-8 + 36 = \frac{1728}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[28 = \frac{1728}{p^3}.\]
Solving for \(p^3\), we get
\[p^3 = \frac{1728}{28} = \frac{432}{7}.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

However, we need to check if this value is consistent with the original equations. Instead, let's re-evaluate the problem with simpler values. If we assume \(x = y = z\), then \(xyz = x^3 = 4\) gives \(x = \sqrt[3]{4}\). Substituting \(x = y = z = \sqrt[3]{4}\) into the other equations, we get:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3x^3 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \neq 4,\]
so \(x = y = z\) is not a solution. Instead, we need to find another approach.

4. Find the grade for which the number of male students who rode the bus is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female students who rode the bus.

Let's start with the calculations:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of male students who rode the bus for each grade
- **9th grade**: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\)

- **10th grade**: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
- **11th grade**: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero.

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the denominator in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

   - The perimeter of the field consists of the two lengths of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles.
   - The circumference of a full circle is \( 2\pi r \), where \( r \) is the radius. Since we have two semicircles, their combined circumference is equal to the circumference of one full circle with radius \( W/2 \) (since the width \( W \) is the diameter of the semicircles).
   - Therefore, the total perimeter \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = 2L + \pi W
     \]
   - We know that the total perimeter is 400 meters:
     \[
     2L + \pi W = 400
     \]

3. **Express \( L \) in Terms of \( W \)**:
   - Rearranging the perimeter equation gives:
     \[
     2L = 400 - \pi W
     \]
     \[
     L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Area of the Field**:
   - The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
     \[
     A = L \times W
     \]
   - Substituting the expression for \( L \):
     \[
     A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
     \]
     \[
     A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
     \]

5. **Maximize the Area**:
   - To find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
     \[
     \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
     \]
     \[
     \pi W = 200
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{200}{\pi}
     \]

6. **Calculate \( L \)**:
   - Now substituting \( W \) back into the equation for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right) = 200 - 100 = 100
     \]

7. **Calculate the Maximum Area**:
   - Now we can find the maximum area:
     \[
     A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
     \]

8. **Final Answer**:
   - The largest possible area of the field is:

" given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we need to find \(\sin{T}\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the side opposite to angle \(R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows:
- The side opposite to angle \(R\) is \(RS = 2\).
- The hypotenuse \(RT = 5\).
- The side opposite to angle \(T\) is \(ST\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of \(ST\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]
\[
ST^2 = 21
\]
\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of angle \(T\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is \(RS = 2\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT = 5\). Therefore,
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance \(d\) from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((x, y)\) is given by the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x\):

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us three critical points: \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\).

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

1. For \(x = 0\):
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]

2. For \(x = \sqrt{2}\):
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

3. For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

The distance can be expressed as \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\).

Finally, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are the vertices of one face and \( E, F \) are the vertices of the opposite face. The point \( P \) is such that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, but we don't know which vertex corresponds to which distance.

First, we need to use the property of the regular octahedron that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to \( 4a^2 \), where \( a \) is the edge length of the octahedron.

Let's denote the distances from \( P \) to the vertices as \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6 \) where \( d_1 = 3 \), \( d_2 = 7 \), \( d_3 = 8 \), \( d_4 = 9 \), \( d_5 = 11 \), and \( d_6 \) is the unknown distance. According to the property of the regular octahedron, we have:

\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 = 4a^2
\]

We can calculate the sum of the squares of the known distances:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

So, we have:

\[
324 + d_6^2 = 4a^2
\]

Since \( 4a^2 \) is a constant, we need to find the value of \( d_6 \) such that the equation holds. We know that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant, and the only unknown distance is \( d_6 \). Therefore, \( d_6 \) must be the remaining distance that completes the sum to the constant value.

Given the distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, the only logical value for \( d_6 \) that fits the pattern and the property of the regular octahedron is the one that makes the sum of the squares equal to \( 4a^2 \). By trial and error or logical deduction, we find that:

\[
d_6 = 6

"To find the ratio of the acceleration of the soccer ball to the baseball, we start with the formula for force, which is given by:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. Since the force applied by Gene to the soccer ball is the same as the force applied by Jack to the baseball, we can write:

\[ F_{\text{soccer}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

This implies:

\[ m_{\text{soccer}} \cdot a_{\text{soccer}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the soccer ball and the baseball as follows:
\[ m_{\text{soccer}} = 200 \text{ grams} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ grams} \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the soccer ball to the acceleration of the baseball, which is:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{soccer}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \]

From the equation \( m_{\text{soccer}} \cdot a_{\text{soccer}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \), we can solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{soccer}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{soccer}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{soccer}}} \]

Substituting the given masses:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{soccer}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150}{200} = \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"First, we need to convert the decimal number \(629_{10}\) into its representations in base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7, we repeatedly divide by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

1. \(629 \div 7 = 89\) remainder \(6\)
2. \(89 \div 7 = 12\) remainder \(5\)

"To find the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to convert the fraction into its decimal form.

1. **Convert the fraction to a decimal**:
   \[
   \frac{137}{500} = 0.274
   \]

2. **Identify the digits to the right of the decimal point**:
   The decimal expansion \(0.274\) has the digits \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\) to the right of the decimal point.

3. **Find the last non-zero digit**:
   The last digit in the decimal expansion \(0.274\) is \(4\), which is non-zero.

"To find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to determine the region within the rectangle where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's denote the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \(ABCD\) as follows:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
d(O, (x, y)) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d(A, (x, y)) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

This inequality represents a line in the \(xy\)-plane. Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:
- For \(B = (a, b)\):
  \[
  ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
  \]
- For \(C = (a, -b)\):
  \[
  ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
  \]
- For \(D = (-a, -b)\):
  \[
  ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
  \]

These four inequalities define a region inside the rectangle where the point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex. This region is a smaller rectangle with the same center \(O\) and sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle.

The side lengths of the smaller rectangle are:
- Length: \(a\)
- Width: \(b\)

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}} = a \times b
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = 2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{smaller}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Modulo Operation**: The expression \(54 \mod 6\) means we need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. In other words, we need to find the remainder of the division \(54 \div 6\).

2. **Perform the Division**: Divide 54 by 6.
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9
   \]
   The quotient is 9, which means 6 goes into 54 exactly 9 times.

3. **Calculate the Product of the Quotient and the Divisor**: Multiply the quotient by the divisor to find the product.
   \[
   9 \times 6 = 54
   \]

4. **Find the Remainder**: Subtract the product from the original number to find the remainder.

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we add the values of the three terms together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by Linda, Sherry, John, and Cindy. We do this by adding their individual earnings together:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:

1. Add 27.47 and 35.23:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]

2. Add the result to 37.37:
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]

3. Add the result to 26.52:
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

So, the total amount of money earned is $126.59.

Next, we need to convert the largest possible amount of the total earnings into paper currency. The largest paper currency note is $100. Therefore, we can convert $100 of the total earnings into paper currency.

The remaining amount after converting $100 into paper currency is:
\[
126.59 - 100 = 26.59
\]

Since we are asked to express the remaining amount in cents, we convert $26.59 to cents by multiplying by 100:
\[
26.59 \times 100 = 2659
\]

Thus, the remaining amount of money, in cents, after converting the largest possible amount of the total earnings into paper currency is \(\boxed{2659}\).","[2659, '2659']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total score for the students who got 80:

   20 \text{ students} \times 80 \text{ points/student} = 1600 \text{ points}
   \]

2. Calculate the total score for the students who got 90:

3. Calculate the total score for the students who got 100:

5. Divide the overall total score by the number of students to get the average score:

"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the columns and the diagonals:

The magic square becomes:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\

Let's check the sum of the first column:
\[

\]

Let's check the sum of the second column:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the third column:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the main diagonal:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the other diagonal:
\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

"To determine how much less distance Jim walks compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person walks and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Martha walks. Martha walks along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she walks is:
\[
\text{Distance Martha walks} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jim walks. Jim walks diagonally across the field, so the distance he walks is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 400 feet and 300 feet. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find this distance:
\[
\text{Distance Jim walks} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha walks and the distance Jim walks:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Jim walks \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega \neq 1\) and \(\omega^2 \neq 1\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
