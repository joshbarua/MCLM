"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) and \( c \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.**
2. **Rotate the translated \( z \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).**
3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.**

Let's start with the given complex numbers:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

### Step 1: Translate \( z \) and \( c \) so that \( c \) is at the origin.
First, we find the difference between \( z \) and \( c \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

### Step 2: Rotate the translated \( z \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).
To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \(\theta\), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \). For \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), we have:
\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we multiply \(\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i\) by \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\):
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - 3i\frac{2}{2} - 3i^2\frac{2}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

### Step 3: Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.
Now, we add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:
\[ w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to consider the constraints and use combinatorial methods step by step.

1. **Treat Peter, Rose, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Peter, Rose, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Peter-Rose-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) in a circle.

2. **Arrange the units in a circle**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Peter, Rose, and Thomas within their block**: Within their block, Peter, Rose, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the arrangements**: To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Peter, Rose, and Thomas sit together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units in a circle by the number of ways to arrange Peter, Rose, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people in a circle such that Peter, Rose, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) that does not contain the variable \(x\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero. First, let's simplify the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
5k = 15 \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

Now, we multiply these values together:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) that does not contain the variable \(x\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True

"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the other possible diagonal, which is the one connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\).

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid. The correct approach is to consider the other possible diagonal, which is the one connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the smallest positive constant \( C \) such that the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all 2-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\]

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}\]

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one tree in terms of the weight of one square and one coconut. Let's define the variables first:

- Let the weight of one tree be \( T \).
- Let the weight of one square be \( S \).
- Let the weight of one coconut be \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ten trees, three squares, and one coconut have the same weight.
2. Two trees and one coconut have the same weight as one square.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:

1. \( 10T + 3S + C = 0 \) (since the total weight is zero, we can assume the weight is balanced)
2. \( 2T + C = S \)

We need to find the weight of one square in terms of the weight of one tree. Let's start by solving the second equation for \( C \):

\[ C = S - 2T \]

Now substitute this expression for \( C \) into the first equation:

\[ 10T + 3S + (S - 2T) = 0 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 10T - 2T + 3S + S = 0 \]
\[ 8T + 4S = 0 \]

Factor out the common term 4:

\[ 4(2T + S) = 0 \]

Since 4 is not zero, we can divide both sides by 4:

\[ 2T + S = 0 \]

Solve for \( S \):

\[ S = -2T \]

Now we know that one square weighs \(-2\) times the weight of one tree. To find out how many trees have the same weight as one square, we take the absolute value of the ratio of the weight of one square to the weight of one tree:

\[ \left| \frac{S}{T} \right| = \left| \frac{-2T}{T} \right| = 2 \]

Therefore, the weight of one square is equal to the weight of \(\boxed{2}\) trees.","[2, '2']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form should match the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
We distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a

We know this must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its behavior in the two different intervals: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) is increasing for \(x \geq a\). Therefore, it intersects every horizontal line at most once.
- If \(a < 0\), the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) is decreasing for \(x \geq a\). Therefore, it intersects every horizontal line at most once.

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is increasing. Therefore, it intersects every horizontal line at most once.
- If \(a < 0\), the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is decreasing. Therefore, it intersects every horizontal line at most once.

### Step 3: Ensure the function intersects every horizontal line at most once across both intervals
We need to check the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) from both pieces of the function to ensure there are no overlaps in the range of \(f(x)\).

- From the piece \(x \geq a\), we have \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
- From the piece \(x < a\), we have \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the function to intersect every horizontal line at most once, the value of \(f(a)\) from both pieces must be the same:
\[ a^3 = a^2 + 2a. \]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

Since we are looking for the maximum value of \(a\), we choose \(a = 2\).

### Verification
For \(a = 2\):
- The function for \(x \geq 2\) is \(f(x) = 2x^2\), which is a parabola opening upwards and intersects every horizontal line at most once.
- The function for \(x < 2\) is \(f(x) = 2x + 4\), which is a line with a positive slope and intersects every horizontal line at most once.
- At \(x = 2\), both pieces give \(f(2) = 8\), so there is no overlap in the range of \(f(x)\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the given equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
Since \(x \in [0,1]\), the second solution is valid if and only if \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). This inequality simplifies to:
\[
0 \le \lambda - 1 \le \lambda \implies 1 \le \lambda.
\]
So, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). We start by computing \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\).
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

The first case \(x = 0\) is a fixed point, so we discard it. We need to solve the second equation:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 = 1 \implies -\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to this equation because it is a fixed point. Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^3 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + 2\lambda^3 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^3 \left(\frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3}\right) + 2\lambda^3 \left(\frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2}\right) - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies -(\lambda - 1)^3 + 2\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (\lambda + 1)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
-(\lambda^3 - 3\lambda^2 + 3\lambda - 1) + 2\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) - \lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies -\lambda^3 + 3\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 1 + 2\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 2\lambda - \lambda^3 + \lambda + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies 0 = 0.
\]
This confirms that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is indeed a solution. For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), the cubic equation \(-\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0\) must have another root in \([0,1]\). This is possible if and only if \(\lambda = 2\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False
"To solve the given equation for \(\theta\), we start with the expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

First, we simplify the numerator. Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine, we know that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]

Applying this to the first two terms and the last two terms separately, we get:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ
\]

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator. Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine, we know that:

\[
\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B)
\]

Applying this to the first two terms and the last two terms separately, we get:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin (-15^\circ) = -\sin 15^\circ
\]
\[
-\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 50^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 55^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

So, the denominator becomes:

\[
-\sin 15^\circ + \sin 55^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

Now, we use the sum-to-product identities for sine:

\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ
\]

For the denominator:

\[
-\sin 15^\circ + \sin 55^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = \sin 55^\circ - \sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{55^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{55^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) - \sin 15^\circ = 2 \cos 70^\circ \sin (-15^\circ) - \sin 15^\circ = -2 \cos 70^\circ \sin 15^\circ - \sin 15^\circ = -\sin 15^\circ (2 \cos 70^\circ + 1)
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 70^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
-\sin 15^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ + 1)
\]

So, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\sin 15^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ + 1)}
\]

We know that \(\cos 55^\circ = \sin 35^\circ\), so:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 15^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ + 1)}
\]

Using the identity \(\sin 35^\circ = \sin (45^\circ - 10^\circ) = \sin 45^\circ \cos 10^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 10^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos 10^\circ - \sin 10^\circ)\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos 10^\circ - \sin 10^\circ)}{-\sin 15^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ + 1)}
\]

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression matches the tangent of a specific angle. By trial and error or using known values, we find that:

\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word contains repeated letters. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E, where the letter E appears twice and the letter L appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{5040}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by the powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since all higher powers of 5 will result in fractions less than 1, their integer parts will be 0. Therefore, we sum the values:

\[
8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots = 9
\]

Thus, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( \phi = 0 \), or \( \theta = 0 \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). This gives us \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 1 \) and \( y = \sin 0 = 0 \), or \( x = \sin 0 = 0 \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 1 \).

Here, \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

Given that \(G\) is the centroid, the line segment from \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) and intersecting \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\) forms a smaller triangle \(AMN\) that is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(2:3\) (since \(AG:AD = 2:3\)).

\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

"To find the minimum possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

Given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we first calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we find:

\[

"To find the derivative of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to determine the derivative of the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

We can find the derivative of \( f(x) \) by applying the power rule to each term. The power rule states that if \( f(x) = x^n \), then \( f'(x) = nx^{n-1} \). Applying this rule, we get:

\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 98x + 623 \]

Now, we need to find the derivative of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). Using the chain rule, which states that if \( g(x) = f(u) \) and \( u = x+5 \), then \( g'(x) = f'(u) \cdot u' \), we get:

\[ g'(x) = f'(x+5) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x+5) \]

Since the derivative of \( x+5 \) is 1, we have:

\[ g'(x) = f'(x+5) \]

Now, we substitute \( x+5 \) into the derivative of \( f(x) \):

\[ f'(x+5) = 3(x+5)^2 - 98(x+5) + 623 \]

We expand each term separately. First, we expand \( (x+5)^2 \):

\[ (x+5)^2 = x^2 + 10x + 25 \]

So, we have:

\[ 3(x+5)^2 = 3(x^2 + 10x + 25) = 3x^2 + 30x + 75 \]

Next, we expand \( -98(x+5) \):

\[ -98(x+5) = -98x - 490 \]

Now, we combine all the terms:

\[ f'(x+5) = 3x^2 + 30x + 75 - 98x - 490 + 623 \]

We combine the like terms:

\[ f'(x+5) = 3x^2 + (30x - 98x) + (75 - 490 + 623) = 3x^2 - 68x + 208 \]

Rearranging the terms, we get:

\[ t = \frac{2}{k - 1} \]

Since \( t \) is an odd integer, \( k - 1 \) must be a divisor of 2. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. Therefore, \( k - 1 \) can be either 1 or 2.

Next, we need to multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

Substituting \( x = 5 \) into the function, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.

Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3},

which simplifies to

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

Thus, the solutions to the equation are

(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose and arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the points are chosen and arranged in a specific order, there are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining 3 points relative to \(A\).

The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:

\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical vessels are required to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical vessel:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical vessels} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical vessels required to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"To determine the number of ways to form a team of 5 members from a group of 8 engineers and 6 technicians, with the condition that each team must include at least one member from each group, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a team of 5 members from 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a team of 5 members that are all engineers:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 engineers from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a team of 5 members that includes at least one member from each group:**
   This is the total number of ways to form a team of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a team of 5 members that are all engineers and the number of ways to form a team of 5 members that are all technicians:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a team of 5 members that includes at least one member from each group is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we substitute these values into the difference of squares formula:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"Let the three consecutive integers be \( x \), \( x+1 \), and \( x+2 \).

According to the problem, the product of these three integers is 120:
\[
x(x+1)(x+2) = 120
\]

Next, we need to find the average of these three integers:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1
\]

The problem states that when the product is divided by the average, the result is 24:
\[
\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
x(x+2) = 24
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0
\]

Now, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -24 \).

Calculating the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-24) = 4 + 96 = 100
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2}
\]

This gives us two possible solutions:
1. \( x = \frac{-2 + 10}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \)
2. \( x = \frac{-2 - 10}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6 \)

Now we have two sets of consecutive integers:
1. If \( x = 4 \), the integers are \( 4, 5, 6 \).
2. If \( x = -6 \), the integers are \( -6, -5, -4 \).

Next, we find the largest integer in each case:
1. For \( 4, 5, 6 \), the largest integer is \( 6 \).
2. For \( -6, -5, -4 \), the largest integer is \( -4 \).

"To find the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

2. **Rewrite the left side as a perfect square:**
   Notice that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as:
   \[

3. **Take the square root of both sides:**
   Remember to consider both the positive and negative roots:
   \[
   x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}

"To solve for the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(AB = AC\)
   - \(AM = 11\)
   - \(AD = 10\)
   - \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\)

2. **Determine the length of \(MD\):**
   Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), we have:
   \[
   MD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1
   \]

3. **Use the property of the angle bisector:**
   Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) (because \(AB = AC\)), \(AM\) is the altitude and the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Therefore, \(\angle BMD = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\).

4. **Apply the tangent function in \(\triangle BMD\):**
   In \(\triangle BMD\),
   \[
   \tan \left(90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{BD}{MD} = \frac{BD}{1} = BD
   \]
   Since \(\tan \left(90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \cot \frac{\theta}{2}\), we have:
   \[
   BD = \cot \frac{\theta}{2}
   \]

5. **Apply the tangent function in \(\triangle BDC\):**
   In \(\triangle BDC\),
   \[
   \tan 3\theta = \frac{BC}{2BD}
   \]
   Using the triple angle identity for tangent, \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\), and knowing that \(\tan \theta = \frac{BC}{2AM} = \frac{BC}{22}\), we substitute:
   \[
   \tan 3\theta = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{BC}{22} - \left(\frac{BC}{22}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{BC}{22}\right)^2}
   \]
   However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(BD = \cot \frac{\theta}{2}\) and \(BD = \frac{BC}{2}\), so:
   \[
   \tan 3\theta = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2}} = 1
   \]
   This implies \(3\theta = 45^\circ\) or \(\theta = 15^\circ\).

6. **Determine the length of \(BC\):**
   Since \(\theta = 15^\circ\),
   \[
   \tan 15^\circ = \frac{BC}{22}
   \]
   Using the identity \(\tan 15^\circ = 2 - \sqrt{3}\),
   \[
   2 - \sqrt{3} = \frac{BC}{22} \implies BC = 22(2 - \sqrt{3})

7. **Determine the length of \(AB\):**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle AMB\),
   \[
   AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \left(11(2 - \sqrt{3})\right)^2 = 121 + 121(4 - 4\sqrt{3} + 3) = 121 + 121(7 - 4\sqrt{3}) = 121(8 - 4\sqrt{3})
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   AB = 11\sqrt{8 - 4\sqrt{3}} = 11\sqrt{4(2 - \sqrt{3})} = 22\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}}
   \]

8. **Calculate the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\):**
   The perimeter is:
   \[
   AB + AC + BC = 22\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}} + 22\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}} + 22(2 - \sqrt{3}) = 44\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}} + 22(2 - \sqrt{3})
   \]
   Simplifying further, we get:

   44\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}} + 44 - 22\sqrt{3} = 44

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Next, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3).\]
So the inequality is:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
To solve this, we find the roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\), which are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
  \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
  So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

- For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
  \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
  So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

- For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
  \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
  So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\), we substitute back to get:
\[-7 < x^2 < 3.\]
Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, the inequality \(-7 < x^2\) is always true. Thus, the solution simplifies to:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

Again, let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[-4 < y^2 + 4y.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
Notice that this can be factored as:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The expression \((y + 2)^2\) is a perfect square and is always non-negative, except when \(y = -2\). Therefore, the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) holds for all \(y \neq -2\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, \(y = -2\) is not in the range of \(y\). Thus, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\).

### Step 3: Combine the solutions

The solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities we solved. From Step 1, we have:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
From Step 2, we have that the inequality is always true. Therefore, the solution to the original inequality is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).

Next, we use the identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting the given value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p)\),
2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 4p).
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{12}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{12}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 4p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 4p^3}{p^2},
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{12(144 - 4p^3)}{p^3},

\[
-8p^3 = 12(144 - 4p^3),

### Step 1: Calculate the number of male students who took the exam in each class
- **9th class**: \(41.1\% \times 600 = 246.6 \approx 247\)
- **10th class**: \(34.4\% \times 600 = 206.4 \approx 206\)

"To find the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) that is closest to the origin, we need to minimize the distance between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \(d\) between the origin \((0, 0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) is given by the formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \( y \) in the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(d\), it is equivalent to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

The solutions to this equation are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \), which occurs at \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We now find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinates:

For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Thus, the points on the curve that are closest to the origin are \( \left( \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \) and \( \left( -\sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \). The distance from either point to the origin is:

\[ d = \sqrt{\left( \sqrt{2} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Therefore, the minimum distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \), and we have \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[ a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors: \( x = 0 \) and \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution. Testing other possible rational roots or using numerical methods would show that there are no other real roots greater than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

The answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to use the property of a regular octagon that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octagon to the vertices is constant. This property is a generalization of the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular polygon to the vertices is constant.

Given that the distances from the point \( P \) to five of the vertices of the regular octagon are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's denote the vertices of the regular octagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, A_8 \) in a clockwise manner. Without loss of generality, let's assume the distances from \( P \) to \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, respectively. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to \( A_6 \).

The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all eight vertices of the regular octagon is constant. Let this constant sum be \( S \). Therefore, we have:
\[
PA_1^2 + PA_2^2 + PA_3^2 + PA_4^2 + PA_5^2 + PA_6^2 + PA_7^2 + PA_8^2 = S
\]

We know the values of \( PA_1, PA_2, PA_3, PA_4, \) and \( PA_5 \):
\[
PA_1^2 = 3^2 = 9, \quad PA_2^2 = 7^2 = 49, \quad PA_3^2 = 8^2 = 64, \quad PA_4^2 = 9^2 = 81, \quad PA_5^2 = 11^2 = 121
\]

Let \( PA_6 = x \). Then:
\[
PA_6^2 = x^2
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, we can write:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 + PA_7^2 + PA_8^2 = S
\]

We also know that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A_7 \) and \( A_8 \) is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A_3 \) and \( A_4 \) (because they are opposite vertices in the regular octagon):
\[
PA_7^2 + PA_8^2 = PA_3^2 + PA_4^2 = 64 + 81 = 145
\]

Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 + 145 = S
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:
\[
469 + x^2 = S
\]

Since \( S \) is the constant sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all eight vertices, it must be equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, \) and \( A_8 \) in any other configuration. Therefore, we can conclude that:
\[
x^2 = 145
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
x = \sqrt{145}
\]

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine how many common digits are present in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[

\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Identify the common digits
Now, we compare the digits in the base 7 representation \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation \(1165_8\).

The digits in \(1556_7\) are \(1, 5, 5, 6\).
The digits in \(1165_8\) are \(1, 1, 6, 5\).

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

Thus, there are 3 common digits.

where the line is given by \(Ax + By + C = 0\) and the point is \((x_1, y_1)\).

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point is \((x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. That is,
\[
a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

From the identity for the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, we have:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
a + b + c = 0.

Next, we consider the product of the roots taken three at a time. We have:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

This can be factored as:

(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 0.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we get:
\[
a(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + b(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - 2c = 0.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + b(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2c.
\]

Finally, we consider the product of all the roots:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]
This can be factored as:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = 2.

Thus, we have:
\[

We now have the system of equations:

a + b + c = 0,
\]
\[
ab = 2,
\]
\[
a(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + b(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2c.
\]

From the first two equations, we can express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
c = -a - b.
\]
Substituting \(c = -a - b\) into the third equation, we get:
\[
a(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + b(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2(-a - b) = -2a - 2b.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + b(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = -2a - 2b.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rhombus \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions defined by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting \(O\) to each vertex.

First, let's consider the rhombus \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at \(O\) and bisect each other at right angles. The diagonals also bisect the angles of the rhombus.

The perpendicular bisector of \(OA\) is the line that passes through the midpoint of \(OA\) and is perpendicular to \(OA\). Similarly, we can define the perpendicular bisectors of \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\).

These perpendicular bisectors will form a smaller rhombus inside \(ABCD\) whose vertices are the midpoints of the segments \(OA\), \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\). This smaller rhombus is similar to the original rhombus \(ABCD\) and has a side length that is half of the side length of \(ABCD\).

The area of the smaller rhombus is therefore \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) of the area of the original rhombus. This is because the area of a rhombus is proportional to the square of its side length.

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rhombus \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) is the ratio of the area of the smaller rhombus to the area of the original rhombus, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).
