"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}i}{2} + \frac{6\sqrt{2}i^2}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Now, check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Combining these results, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

4. Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization. We know that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

So, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a circular table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a circular table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100 x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6} = -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100 x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot x^6 \cdot \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise around its center to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the properties of rotational symmetry of a regular pentagon.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and it can be rotated by an angle that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing a full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides. This angle is given by:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This means that the pentagon will look the same after being rotated by 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and 360 degrees. The smallest positive angle of rotation that will make the pentagon coincide with its original position is 72 degrees.

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, this does not satisfy \(x > 7\). Let's consider the last possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). This satisfies \(x > 7\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula with \(2\cos A\):

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can simplify the expression by canceling \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\tan A = 2

Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as these values will cause the function to approach infinity or negative infinity.

The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) to find the roots:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us:
\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
\]
\[
x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
\]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we need to find the sum \( a + b + c \):

a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one tree in terms of the weight of one squig. Let's define the weights of the objects as follows:
- Let the weight of one tree be \( T \).
- Let the weight of one squig be \( S \).
- Let the weight of one goolee be \( G \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ten trees weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two trees and one goolee weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We can use the second equation to express \( G \) in terms of \( T \) and \( S \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)

Simplify the right-hand side:

This tells us that the weight of one tree is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the weight of one squig. To find out how many trees weigh the same as one squig, we take the reciprocal of the weight of one tree in terms of a squig:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
   \]
   This matches.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), so we have:
   \[
   -2(-3) = 6

   This matches.

Thus, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which water is being poured into the tank and the rate at which the water level is rising when the tank is full.

First, let's denote the radius of the tank by \( r \) meters and the height of the tank by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We know that water is being poured into the tank at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. This is the rate of change of the volume with respect to time, so we can write:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

We also know that when the tank is full, the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This is the rate of change of the height with respect to time, so we can write:
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):
\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases, so it does not have a minimum value.

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) decreases, and its value at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases, and its value at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, it must take on all real values. This means that the range of \(f(x)\) must be \((-\infty, \infty)\).

- If \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\), and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For the function to cover all real values, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).
  \[
  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0
  \]
  \[
  a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0
  \]
  \[
  a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0
  \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]\). Since \(a > 0\), we have \(a \in (0, 2]\).

- If \(a < 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\), and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). Since both ranges are \((-\infty, \infty)\), the function will intersect every horizontal line at least once for any \(a < 0\).

### Step 4: Find the maximum value of \(a\)
The maximum value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is the maximum value in the interval \((0, 2]\), which is \(2\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the value of \( c \) that makes the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). Since \(\lambda > 0\), the inequality \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) simplifies to \(\lambda \ge 1\), and the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is always true. Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in \([0,1]\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\) and \(y \neq x\). Since \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into the equation \(f(y) = x\):
\[
f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x \implies \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
Let \(z = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
\lambda z(1 - z) = x.
\]
Since \(z = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(x = \frac{z}{\lambda(1 - z)}\) into \(z = \lambda x(1 - x)\):
\[
z = \lambda \left(\frac{z}{\lambda(1 - z)}\right) \left(1 - \frac{z}{\lambda(1 - z)}\right) = \frac{z}{1 - z} \left(\frac{\lambda(1 - z) - z}{\lambda(1 - z)}\right) = \frac{z(\lambda - \lambda z - z)}{\lambda(1 - z)^2} = \frac{z(\lambda - (\lambda + 1)z)}{\lambda(1 - z)^2}.
\]
Assuming \(z \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(z\):
\[
1 = \frac{\lambda - (\lambda + 1)z}{\lambda(1 - z)^2}.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda(1 - z)^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)z \implies \lambda(1 - 2z + z^2) = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)z \implies \lambda - 2\lambda z + \lambda z^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)z \implies \lambda z^2 - \lambda z + z = 0 \implies z(\lambda z - \lambda + 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
z = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad z = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
If \(z = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\), which implies \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\). But \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f(1) = 0\), so \(f(f(x)) = 0 = x\), which does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\).

If \(z = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). We need to check if this value of \(z\) is in the interval \([0,1]\) and if it satisfies the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\). We already know that \(z = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in \([0,1]\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are:

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we can further simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression matches the tangent of a specific angle. By trial and error or using a calculator, we find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   This means there are 8 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40).

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[

   There are no multiples of 125 in this range.

Since higher powers of 5 will also contribute factors of 5, but there are no such multiples in the range from 1 to 42, we stop here.

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]

we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Thus, we can write

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]

which simplifies to

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}, \]

so

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This can be derived using the multiple-angle formula for cosine. From this, we can deduce that \( \cos(10\theta) = \cos(2\pi - 5\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Next, we use the identity \( \cos(2\theta) = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 \) to find \( \cos(2\theta) \):

\[ \cos(2\theta) = 2\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}\right)^2 - 1 = 2\left(\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{16}\right) - 1 = 2\left(\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16}\right) - 1 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{8} - 1 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{4} - 1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We can see that \( \cos(2\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Using the identity \( \cos(4\theta) = 2\cos^2(2\theta) - 1 \), we find \( \cos(4\theta) \):

\[ \cos(4\theta) = 2\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}\right)^2 - 1 = 2\left(\frac{1 - 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{16}\right) - 1 = 2\left(\frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16}\right) - 1 = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{8} - 1 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{4} - 1 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We can see that \( \cos(4\theta) = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Using the identity \( \cos(8\theta) = 2\cos^2(4\theta) - 1 \), we find \( \cos(8\theta) \):

\[ \cos(8\theta) = 2\left(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{4}\right)^2 - 1 = 2\left(\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{16}\right) - 1 = 2\left(\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16}\right) - 1 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{8} - 1 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{4} - 1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We can see that \( \cos(8\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). From the periodicity and symmetry of the cosine function, we can deduce that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and using properties of the centroid and similar triangles.

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Determine the position of points \( M \) and \( N \):**
   Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through \( G \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the sides, which is \( 2:3 \). Therefore, \( AM:AB = AN:AC = AG:AD = 2:3 \).

3. **Calculate the area of triangle \( AMN \):**
   The area of similar triangles is proportional to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since the ratio of the sides is \( 2:3 \), the ratio of the areas is \( (2/3)^2 = 4/9 \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is \( \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64
   \]

4. **Determine the area of triangle \( ENG \):**
   Triangle \( ENG \) is similar to triangle \( ABC \) with the same similarity ratio as triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \), which is \( 2:3 \). However, triangle \( ENG \) is also similar to triangle \( AMN \) with a ratio of \( 1:2 \) (since \( G \) divides \( MN \) into two equal segments). Therefore, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the area of triangle \( AMN \).
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:

"To determine how many two-digit positive integers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common divisors of these two numbers that are between 10 and 99. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is the product of the lowest power of each prime factor common to both factorizations. Therefore, the GCD of 100 and 150 is:

Given \( x = 2^{24} \), we need to find \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} = k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \), because the exponents must match when expressing \( 2^{24} \) as \( (2^m)^n = 2^{mn} \).

Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of \( 24 \). First, we list the divisors of \( 24 \):

"To determine how many five xu coins Hillary has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( x \) be the number of ten xu coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of five xu coins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 xu.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 10x + 5y = 75 \) (since each ten xu coin is worth 10 xu and each five xu coin is worth 5 xu)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2x + y = 15 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 2x + y = 15 \)

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2x + y - x - y = 4 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Now that we know \( x = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( y \):

"To determine the total area of the shaded regions in the given figure, we need to analyze the structure and the areas of the individual shaded triangles.

First, let's identify the two shaded triangles in the figure:

2. The second triangle has its vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

We will calculate the area of each triangle separately and then sum these areas.

**Step 1: Calculate the area of the first triangle.**

The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units. The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to the x-axis, which is 4 units. The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:

**Step 2: Calculate the area of the second triangle.**

The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((3, 0)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is 3 units. The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to the x-axis, which is 4 units. The area \(A_2\) of a triangle is given by the formula:

"To determine the probability that a chessboard square is colored, we first need to understand the coloring pattern of a standard chessboard. A standard chessboard consists of 64 squares, alternating in color between black and white. Half of the squares are black, and the other half are white. Therefore, there are 32 black squares and 32 white squares on a chessboard.

The problem does not specify the exact pattern of the colored squares, but typically, in a standard chessboard, the squares are colored in a checkerboard pattern, where each row and each column alternates between black and white squares.

Since the problem does not provide any additional information about the coloring pattern, we will assume that the squares are colored in the standard checkerboard pattern. In this pattern, half of the squares are colored black and the other half are colored white.

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen square on the chessboard is colored is the same as the probability that it is either black or white. Since there are 32 black squares and 32 white squares, the total number of colored squares is 64.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen square is colored is:
\[

However, if we interpret ""colored"" to mean ""black or white"" (which is the standard interpretation in chess), the probability is:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,

\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). We can apply this identity to the terms \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\):

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the magnitude formula:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \), so \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all the interior angles minus one angle is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of all interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the given information in terms of the sum of all interior angles:**
   According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles minus one angle is \(1070^\circ\). Let the measure of the missing angle be \(x\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all the interior angles is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   The measure of an interior angle of a convex polygon is always less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(x\) must be less than \(180^\circ\).

5. **Find the possible values for \(n\):**
   We need to find the value of \(n\) such that the equation \((n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x\) holds true for some \(x\) in the range \(0 < x < 180^\circ\).

   First, let's find the approximate value of \(n\) by ignoring \(x\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   \[
   n \approx 7.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we consider \(n = 7\) and \(n = 8\).

6. **Check \(n = 7\):**
   If \(n = 7\), the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) would be:
   \[
   x = 900^\circ - 1070^\circ = -170^\circ
   \]
   Since \(x\) cannot be negative, \(n = 7\) is not a valid solution.

7. **Check \(n = 8\):**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of all the interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) would be:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(x = 10^\circ\) is within the range \(0 < x < 180^\circ\), \(n = 8\) is a valid solution.

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the property of modular inverses. If \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, then we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \) is symmetric around 0 modulo 23):

\[ 1^2 = 1 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 = 4 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 = 9 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 = 16 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two possible solutions for \( t \):

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = 17 \). Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we first need to convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the volume in cubic inches is:

\[ 1 \text{ cubic foot} = 12 \times 12 \times 12 = 1728 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the side length of the cube. Let the side length be \( s \) inches. The volume of a cube is given by \( s^3 \), so we have:

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we compute \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[

Simplifying the components, we get:

Now, we compute the magnitude of \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[

"To determine the number of integer-coordinate points that lie completely within the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

   - The length of the rectangle along the x-axis is from \(-5\) to \(5\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
   - The width of the rectangle along the y-axis is from \(-4\) to \(4\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

2. **Calculate the number of integer points along the x-axis and y-axis:**

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get

\[

\[

\[

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\) is the same as the length of \(\overline{AC}\). Let's denote the length of \(\overline{AC}\) as \(h_1\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h_1.
\]

Because \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{a}{b}.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h_1\) is also the height of \(\triangle ABC\) from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h_1.

The total area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h_1 + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h_1.
\]
We know that:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h_1 = 42.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times h_1 = 84.
\]

Since \(h_1\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h_1.

To find \(h_1\), we use the fact that \(h_1 = h\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b}.
\]

Since \(a + b = 84\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{84} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times 1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21.

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

We can simplify this by canceling the \(10\) in the denominator with the \(70\) in the numerator:

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 7 \times 7 = 49

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",49,"[49, '49']",True
"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to be one pair (the other two points will automatically form the other pair). This is given by:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]
   However, a simpler way to think about it is to consider the permutations of the points and then divide by the number of ways to arrange the pairs, which is \(2!\). So, the number of ways to pair the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]

2. **Determine the number of ways the segments intersect:**
   For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we list the points in order around the circle, they must be in one of the following orders: \(ACBD\), \(ADBC\), \(BACD\), \(BDAC\), \(CABD\), \(CBDA\), \(DABC\), or \(DBCA\). There are 8 such orders.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:
   \[
   \frac{8}{24} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

3. **Determine the total area of the shaded regions:**
   The total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area \(A_{\text{shaded}}\) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Identify the components of the shaded area:**
   The shaded area consists of two regions:
   - A sector of the larger circle.
   - A sector of the smaller circle.

5. **Calculate the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area \(A_{\text{large sector}}\) of the sector of the larger circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{large sector}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
   \]

6. **Calculate the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   The area \(A_{\text{small sector}}\) of the sector of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small sector}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
   \]

7. **Set up the equation for the total shaded area:**
   The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of the two sectors:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{large sector}} + A_{\text{small sector}} = 2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
   \]
   We know that the total shaded area is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

8. **Solve for \(\theta\):**
   To find \(\theta\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{5}\):
   \[
   \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]

9. **Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:**
   Since \(\pi\) radians is equal to 180 degrees, we convert \(\theta\) to degrees:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180}{3} = 120

Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",120,"[120, '120']",True
"To determine how many cylindrical bins are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical bins and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical tank to the volume of one cylindrical bin.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical bin. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical bin, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical bins are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical bin:
\[ \text{Number of bins} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical bins needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 14 members (8 from the Communist Party and 6 from the Democratic Party) such that the committee includes at least one member from each party.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 members without any restrictions. This can be done using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements.

The total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 members is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we need to subtract the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all from the same party. There are two cases to consider: all members are from the Communist Party, or all members are from the Democratic Party.

The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members all from the Communist Party is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members all from the Democratic Party is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members all from the same party is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members all from the same party from the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members to get the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

First, let \( \angle BAC = 2\theta \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta \).

Given \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \), we have \( \angle BDC = 6\theta \).

Since \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = CM \). Let \( BM = CM = x \).

In \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \angle BMD = 90^\circ - (90^\circ - 3\theta) = 3\theta
\]
\[
\angle BMD = 90^\circ - 3\theta
\]

Using the tangent function in \( \triangle BDM \):
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x
\]

Using the tangent function in \( \triangle BMA \):
\[
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}
\]

We know the triple angle identity for tangent:
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}
\]

Let \( \tan(\theta) = t \). Then:
\[
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}
\]
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}

From \( \tan(2\theta) = \frac{x}{11} \), we have:
\[
x = \frac{22t}{1 - t^2}
\]

From \( \tan(3\theta) = x \), we have:
\[
x = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( x \):
\[
\frac{22t}{1 - t^2} = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}
\]

Cross-multiplying:
\[
22t(1 - 3t^2) = (3t - t^3)(1 - t^2)
\]
\[
22t - 66t^3 = 3t - 3t^3 - t^3 + t^5

\[
22t - 66t^3 = 3t - 4t^3 + t^5
\]
\[
t^5 - 62t^3 + 19t = 0

\[
t(t^4 - 62t^2 + 19) = 0

Since \( t \neq 0 \):
\[
t^4 - 62t^2 + 19 = 0

Let \( u = t^2 \). Then:
\[
u^2 - 62u + 19 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:
\[
u = \frac{62 \pm \sqrt{62^2 - 4 \cdot 19}}{2} = \frac{62 \pm \sqrt{3844 - 76}}{2} = \frac{62 \pm \sqrt{3768}}{2} = \frac{62 \pm 2\sqrt{942}}{2} = 31 \pm \sqrt{942}
\]

Since \( u = t^2 \) must be positive and less than 1:
\[
u = 31 - \sqrt{942}
\]

Thus:
\[
t^2 = 31 - \sqrt{942}
\]

Now, we find \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{22t}{1 - t^2} = \frac{22t}{1 - (31 - \sqrt{942})} = \frac{22t}{\sqrt{942} - 30}

Since \( t = \sqrt{31 - \sqrt{942}} \):

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers and then find the median.

First, let's denote the 27 consecutive integers as:

where \(a\) is the smallest integer in the sequence.

The sum of these 27 integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. Here, \(n = 27\), \(d = 1\), so the sum is:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \left(2a + 26\right) = 27 \left(a + 13\right)
\]
We know that the sum of these 27 integers is \(3^7\). Therefore, we have:
\[
27 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

So, \(a = 81 - 13 = 68\).

The 27 consecutive integers are:

The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. Therefore, the median is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we only consider the interval \([0, 3)\). Thus, the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Since \(x^4 \geq 0\) and \(4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative and its minimum value is 0, which occurs when \(x = 0\). Therefore, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this equation as:
\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.\]
Adding and subtracting \(xyz\) in each term, we get:
\[xy(y + x + z - z) + xz(z + x + y - y) + yz(z + y + x - x) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[xy(x + y + z) + xz(x + y + z) + yz(x + y + z) - 3xyz = 12,\]
or
\[(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which further simplifies to
\[(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12 = 12,\]
or
\[(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = 24.\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(24 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(24 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (except at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but these points do not affect the sign of the inequality since they make the expression zero, not negative).

Now, let's determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

Since the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is non-negative and not zero in the interval \((0, 36)\), the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is negative in this interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

\[
\text{Chu vi} = 2l + 2\pi r
\]

Trong đó \( r \) là bán kính của hai nửa hình tròn, và do wingspan (chiều dài cánh) của cánh đồng là \( l \), nên bán kính \( r \) của hai nửa hình tròn là \( \frac{l}{2} \).

Thay \( r \) vào công thức chu vi, ta được:

Từ đó, ta có thể giải ra \( l \):

\[

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sides of the triangle:**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{5}\), the side opposite to angle \(R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the adjacent side:**
   Let the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). According to the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x^2 + 4 = 25

   \[

   \[

3. **Determine the sides relative to angle \(T\):**
   In \(\triangle{RST}\), angle \(T\) is the other non-right angle. The side opposite to angle \(T\) is the adjacent side to angle \(R\), which is \(\sqrt{21}\) units, and the hypotenuse remains 5 units.

4. **Calculate \(\sin{T}\):**
   The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance \(d\) between the origin and this point is given by the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]
Next, we expand and simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]
The minimum distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\). The final answer is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions.

Therefore, the only solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since \( x = -3 \) is the only solution for \( f(x) = 6 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron and the given distances from a point \( P \) to five of its vertices. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \), where \( A, C, E \) are on one face and \( B, D, F \) are on the opposite face. The edges of the octahedron are all of equal length, say \( s \).

Given the distances from \( P \) to five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the distances as follows:
\[ PA = a, PB = b, PC = c, PD = d, PE = e, PF = f \]
where \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) are the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) respectively. Without loss of generality, let's assume \( a = 3, b = 7, c = 8, d = 9, e = 11 \), and we need to find \( f \).

Using the property of the octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant and equal to \( 3s^2 + 3s^2 = 6s^2 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 6s^2 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + f^2 = 6s^2 \]
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + f^2 = 6s^2 \]
\[ 324 + f^2 = 6s^2 \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to \( 6s^2 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 324 + f^2 = 6s^2 \]

To find \( f \), we need to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. Therefore, we have:
\[ f^2 = 6s^2 - 324 \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to \( 6s^2 \). Therefore, we have:

"To solve the problem, we start with the formula for force in physics, which states that force equals mass multiplied by acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force,
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( a \) is the acceleration.

In this problem, Jen and Jack are applying the same force to their respective balls. Therefore, the force \( F \) is the same for both balls. Let's denote the mass of Jen's ball as \( m_J \) and the mass of Jack's ball as \( m_A \). Similarly, let's denote the acceleration of Jen's ball as \( a_J \) and the acceleration of Jack's ball as \( a_A \).

Since the force is the same for both balls, we can write:

\[ m_J \cdot a_J = m_A \cdot a_A \]

We are given the masses of the balls:
- The mass of Jen's ball \( m_J \) is 200 g.
- The mass of Jack's ball \( m_A \) is 150 g.

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to the acceleration of Jack's ball, which is \( \frac{a_J}{a_A} \). Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_J = 150 \cdot a_A \]

To isolate \( \frac{a_J}{a_A} \), we divide both sides of the equation by 150:

\[ \frac{200}{150} \cdot a_J = a_A \]

Next, we divide both sides by \( a_A \):

\[ \frac{200}{150} \cdot \frac{a_J}{a_A} = 1 \]

Then, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_A} \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{200}{150} \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_A} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction \( \frac{150}{200} \) by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150}{200} = \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

First, we calculate the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we calculate the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Expanding this product is quite complex, but we can use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and the polynomial is palindromic (i.e., the coefficients read the same forwards and backwards). This symmetry implies that the roots can be paired such that the products of the pairs are equal. Therefore, the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) can be shown to be equal to \(-4\).

Finally, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1\). Using the identity for the sum of products of sums of products of roots, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Expanding and simplifying this expression, we find that it is equal to \(-4\).

Thus, the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 - 4t + 4 = 0\), which simplifies to \(t^3 - 4t + 4 = 0\). Solving this polynomial, we find the roots to be \(2, -1 + \sqrt{3}i,\) and \(-1 - \sqrt{3}i\).

Therefore, the set is:
\[

"To determine the price of one pencil, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information. Let's denote the price of one pencil by \( p \) dollars and the price of one eraser by \( e \) dollars.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( 2p + e = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5p + e = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( e \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + e) - (2p + e) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3p = 0.58
\]
Next, we solve for \( p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
p = \frac{0.58}{3} = 0.1933\ldots
\]
Since the problem asks for the price in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:
\[
p = 0.1933\ldots \times 100 = 19.33\ldots
\]
Rounding to the nearest cent, we get:
\[
p = 19

Therefore, the price of one pencil is \(\boxed{19}\) cents.","[19, '19']",29,"[29, '29']",False
"To find the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to convert the fraction into its decimal form.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the rectangle as \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \), we have \( a = kb \).

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is the midpoint of both diagonals, so its coordinates are \(O = \left(0, 0\right)\) if we place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(A = \left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(B = \left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(C = \left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\), and \(D = \left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\).

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any vertex. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

For \(P\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < ax + \frac{a^2}{4} - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{4}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the distances to the other vertices \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The region where \(P\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by these inequalities. This region is a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a}{2}\) and \(\frac{b}{2}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\left(\frac{a}{2}\right) \left(\frac{b}{2}\right) = \frac{ab}{4}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\frac{\frac{ab}{4}}{ab} = \frac{1}{4}

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money is left in cents after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have converted their total earnings into the largest possible amount of paper money, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Linda's earnings: \$27.47
   - Sherry's earnings: \$35.23
   - June's earnings: \$37.37
   - Connie's earnings: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's add them step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, the total earnings are \$126.59.

2. **Convert the total earnings into cents:**
   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total earnings by 100:
   \[
   126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the largest possible amount of paper money:**
   The largest paper money denominations are \$100, \$50, \$20, \$10, \$5, and \$1. We need to convert the total amount of 12659 cents into the largest possible paper money.

   - Convert \$100 into cents: \$100 = 10000 cents
   - Convert \$50 into cents: \$50 = 5000 cents
   - Convert \$20 into cents: \$20 = 2000 cents
   - Convert \$10 into cents: \$10 = 1000 cents
   - Convert \$5 into cents: \$5 = 500 cents
   - Convert \$1 into cents: \$1 = 100 cents

   We start with the largest denomination and work our way down:
   - The largest number of \$100 bills we can get is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{12659}{10000} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]
     So, we have 10000 cents from the \$100 bill, leaving:
     \[
     12659 - 10000 = 2659 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of \$50 bills we can get is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{2659}{5000} \right\rfloor = 0 \text{ dollars}

     So, we have 0 cents from the \$50 bills, leaving:

     So, we have 2000 cents from the \$20 bill, leaving:
     \[
     2659 - 2000 = 659 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of \$10 bills we can get is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{659}{1000} \right\rfloor = 0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     So, we have 0 cents from the \$10 bills, leaving:

   - The largest number of \$5 bills we can get is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{659}{500} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]
     So, we have 500 cents from the \$5 bill, leaving:
     \[
     659 - 500 = 159 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of \$1 bills we can get is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{159}{100} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]
     So, we have 100 cents from the \$1 bill, leaving:

   - The largest number of 50-cent coins we can get is:

   - The largest number of 25-cent coins we can get is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{9}{25} \right\rfloor = 0 \text{ coins}
     \]
     So, we have 0 cents from the 25-cent coins, leaving:
     \[
     9 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - The largest number of 10-cent coins we can get is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{9}{10} \right\rfloor = 0 \text{ coins}

     So, we have 0 cents from the 10-cent coins, leaving:

   - The largest number of 5-cent coins we can get is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{9}{5} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ coin}

     So, we have 5 cents from the 5-cent coin, leaving:

   - The largest number of 1-cent coins we can get is:
     \[

"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals are equal. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal.

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3 + n+2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n-9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals must be equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, let's solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the other equation \( 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \):
\[
2(7) + 1 = 4(7) - 13 \implies 14 + 1 = 28 - 13 \implies 15 = 15

"To determine how many feet Jim goes fewer than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes directly along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha goes along the length and then the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is:

So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore, Jim goes fewer than Martha by \(\boxed{200}\) feet.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega \neq 1\) and \(\omega^2 \neq 1\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the minimum total distance for each starting point.

First, let's list the distances between the points:
- \(AB = 6\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will calculate the total distance for each starting point:

1. **Starting from point \(A\):**
   - \(A \to B \to C \to D\): \(AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\)
   - \(A \to B \to D \to C\): \(AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\)
   - \(A \to C \to B \to D\): \(AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)
   - \(A \to C \to D \to B\): \(AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\)
   - \(A \to D \to B \to C\): \(AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
   - \(A \to D \to C \to B\): \(AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)
   The minimum distance starting from \(A\) is \(13\).

2. **Starting from point \(B\):**
   - \(B \to A \to C \to D\): \(BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16\)
   - \(B \to A \to D \to C\): \(BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\)
   - \(B \to C \to A \to D\): \(BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(B \to C \to D \to A\): \(BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)
   - \(B \to D \to A \to C\): \(BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - \(B \to D \to C \to A\): \(BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\)
   The minimum distance starting from \(B\) is \(13\).

3. **Starting from point \(C\):**
   - \(C \to A \to B \to D\): \(CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15\)
   - \(C \to A \to D \to B\): \(CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)
   - \(C \to B \to A \to D\): \(CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(C \to B \to D \to A\): \(CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
   - \(C \to D \to A \to B\): \(CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
   - \(C \to D \to B \to A\): \(CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\)
   The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is \(13\).

4. **Starting from point \(D\):**
   - \(D \to A \to B \to C\): \(DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
   - \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\)
   - \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
   The minimum distance starting from \(D\) is \(14\).

The minimum distance among all the starting points is \(13\). Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point and visiting the other three points exactly once is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
