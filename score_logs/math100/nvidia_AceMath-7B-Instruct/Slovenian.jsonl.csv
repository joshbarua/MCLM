"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{6i}{2} + i^2\frac{6i}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.
   \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Now, we use the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
   \]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange in a circle, so the number of ways to do this is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to seat 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" in a circle and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720
\]

Thus, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Next, we calculate \((10x^3)^2\):

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]

Then, we calculate \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each factor modulo 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder of 4 when divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder of 6 when divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder of 8 when divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, find the remainder of 24 when divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,
\]
so
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the smallest number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions in which the pentagon looks exactly the same. The angle of rotation that maps the pentagon onto itself is given by:

Therefore, the smallest number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let the coordinates of the fourth vertex be \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the other possible diagonal, which is the one connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let the coordinates of the fourth vertex be \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid. The correct approach is to consider the other possible diagonal, which is the one connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Now, let the coordinates of the fourth vertex be \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this solution is valid. The value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute this into the tangent formula:

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can simplify the expression by canceling \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   Let \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}\]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

We use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this in, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( T \) be the weight of one tree.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]

2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find how many treeks weigh the same as one squig. To do this, we will solve the system of equations for \( S \) in terms of \( T \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

Combine like terms on the right side:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[
12T = 4S
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( S \):
\[
S = 3T

This tells us that one squig weighs the same as three treeks. Therefore, the number of treeks that weigh the same as one squig is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this polynomial is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

5. The constant term is \(-2a\), so we have:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the reservoir is being filled and the rate at which the water level rises when it is full.

First, let's denote the radius of the reservoir by \( r \) meters and the height of the water when the reservoir is full by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We know that the reservoir is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. When the reservoir is full, the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is equal to the rate at which the water level rises multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the reservoir. The cross-sectional area of the reservoir is \( \pi r^2 \), so the rate of volume increase can also be expressed as:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Given that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour, we can substitute these values into the equation:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To solve for \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):
\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the reservoir is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Case 1: \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on \(x \geq a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases, so it does not have a minimum value.

### Case 2: \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) decreases, and its value at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases, and its value at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

### Combining Both Cases
For the graph of \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the function must cover all real values. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\), and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).
  \[
  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0
  \]
  \[
  a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0
  \]
  \[
  a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0
  \]
  The roots of the polynomial are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2]\). The inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds for \(0 < a \leq 2\).

- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound, so it will always intersect every horizontal line. However, we are looking for the largest value of \(a\), so we do not consider negative values.

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

The fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)). We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(x\) is not a fixed point but satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need this to equal \(x\):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]

Since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(x = \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - x)}\) into the equation:

\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = \frac{y}{\lambda (1 - x)}. \]

Assuming \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[ \lambda (1 - y) = \frac{1}{\lambda (1 - x)}. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - y)(1 - x) = 1. \]

Since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) back:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x(1 - x))(1 - x) = 1. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function and its iterates. It is known from the theory of dynamical systems that for the quadratic map \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), the period-doubling bifurcations occur at specific values of \(\lambda\). The first period-doubling bifurcation occurs at \(\lambda = 3\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan(A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

This matches the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 35^\circ\):
\[
\tan 35^\circ = \frac{\tan 65^\circ + \tan 5^\circ}{1 - \tan 65^\circ \tan 5^\circ}.

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence where the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula again:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",350,"[350, '350']",True
"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a decimal, we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the denominator.
2. Perform the division.

First, let's simplify the denominator:
\[2^2 = 4\]
\[5^7 = 78125\]
So, the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125}\]

Next, we multiply the denominator:
\[4 \cdot 78125 = 312500\]
So, the fraction is now:
\[\frac{21}{312500}\]

Now, we perform the division:
\[21 \div 312500 = 0.0000672\]

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common divisors of these two numbers that are between 10 and 99.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors common to both numbers:

"To determine how many petak coins Hillary has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of desetk coins.
- Let \( p \) be the number of petak coins.

According to the problem, Hillary has a total of 11 coins, all of which are either desetk or petak. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ d + p = 11 \]

We also know that the total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since each desetk coin is worth 10 cents and each petak coin is worth 5 cents, we can write another equation:
\[ 10d + 5p = 75 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( d + p = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5p = 75 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2d + p = 15 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( d + p = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + p = 15 \)

To eliminate \( p \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2d + p) - (d + p) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2d + p - d - p = 4 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( p \):
\[ 4 + p = 11 \]
\[ p = 11 - 4 \]
\[ p = 7 \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse select is an even number, we first need to identify the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to understand the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. The sum of two numbers is odd if one number is even and the other is odd.

Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the rest are odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Therefore, there are 1 even number and 5 odd numbers in the set.

We need to calculate the probability that the sum of the numbers selected by Paul and Jesse is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse select even numbers.
2. Both Paul and Jesse select odd numbers.

Since there is only one even number in the set, the probability that Paul selects an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\) and the probability that Jesse selects an even number is also \(\frac{1}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Paul and Jesse select even numbers is:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}

The probability that Paul selects an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\) and the probability that Jesse selects an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Paul and Jesse select odd numbers is:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}

Adding these two probabilities together gives the total probability that the sum of the numbers selected by Paul and Jesse is even:

The diagram shows a pravokotnik (rectangle) formed by 12 squares, each with a side length of 1 unit. The rectangle has a length of 3 units and a width of 4 units. The shaded region consists of two right triangles.

First, let's identify the two triangles:
1. The first triangle has its base along the bottom side of the rectangle from (0,0) to (2,0) and its height along the left side of the rectangle from (0,0) to (0,4).
2. The second triangle has its base along the bottom side of the rectangle from (0,0) to (3,0) and its height along the left side of the rectangle from (0,0) to (0,4).

The area of a right triangle is given by the formula:
\[

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we start by noting that 450 can be factored into its prime factors:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2. \]
A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Since the number must consist only of the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to be divisible by 25. Additionally, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 to be divisible by 9.

   - The dama's column is determined by the remainder when the first number (from 1 to 8) is divided by 4.
   - The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 0. However, since the columns are labeled from 1 to 8, the remainder 0 corresponds to column 4.
   - Therefore, the possible columns are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Identify the possible outcomes for the second spin:**
   - The dama's row is determined by the remainder when the second number (from 1 to 8) is divided by 5.

\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x)\) can be simplified as follows:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Let \(x = 20^\circ\), then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.

Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms of the expression:

\]
\[

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the sum of all the interior angles be \(S\). Since the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), the sum of all the interior angles \(S\) is:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   where \(x\) is the measure of the one missing interior angle.

2. **Determine the range for the missing angle:**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < x < 180^\circ
   \]

3. **Set up the inequality for the sum of the interior angles:**
   Using the formula for the sum of the interior angles, we have:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Since \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\), it follows that:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

4. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{107}{18} < n-2
   \]
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Now, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the congruence:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have two candidates: \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). The odd one is \( t = 17 \).

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[

\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we compute \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we compute the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

   - The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-5\) to \(5\).
   - The \(y\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-4\) to \(4\).

2. **Determine the points strictly inside the rectangle:**

3. Calculate the total cost of all stamps from the 1970s.

- Brazil: 12 stamps, each costing 6 cents.
- France: 12 stamps, each costing 6 cents.
- Peru: 6 stamps, each costing 4 cents.
- Spain: 6 stamps, each costing 5 cents.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each country:

- Total cost for Brazil: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents.
- Total cost for France: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents.
- Total cost for Peru: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cents.

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are no restrictions on the order in which they are chosen. However, the order in which the points are chosen does not affect the probability of intersection, so we can consider the problem in terms of the relative positions of the points on the circle.

2. **Determine the condition for the chords to intersect:**
   The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

3. **Calculate the number of favorable arrangements:**
   There are \(4!\) (24) possible ways to arrange the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a specific order. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points relative to \(A\).

   Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords intersecting (the alternating patterns mentioned above). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is \(2\). The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:

   Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area \(A_{\text{shaded, large}}\) of the sector of the larger circle is:

   \[
   A_{\text{shaded, small}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
   \]

5. **Set up the equation for the total shaded area:**
   The total area of the shaded regions is the sum of the areas of the sectors in both circles:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{shaded, large}} + A_{\text{shaded, small}} = 2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}

   We know that the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]
Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\). Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Substituting these values into the angle addition formula, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]

Next, we use the angle subtraction formula for sine:
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha.
\]
Substituting the values we found, we get:
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]
This is a difference of squares, so we have:
\[
(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2\sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{9}{100} = 0.09.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0.09}.

"To convert the speed of the wheel from revolutions per minute (čevljev na minuto) to inches per second (palcih na sekundo), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert revolutions per minute to revolutions per second:**
   Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide the speed in revolutions per minute by 60.
   \[
   \text{Revolutions per second} = \frac{20 \text{ čevljev na minuto}}{60 \text{ sekund na minuto}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ revolution per second}
   \]

2. **Convert revolutions per second to inches per second:**
   We need to know the circumference of the wheel to convert revolutions per second to inches per second. However, the problem does not provide the diameter or radius of the wheel, so we will assume the wheel's circumference is given or can be calculated. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the circumference of the wheel is \(C\) inches. The speed in inches per second is then the circumference multiplied by the number of revolutions per second.
   \[
   \text{Speed in inches per second} = C \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{C}{3} \text{ inches per second}
   \]

Since the problem does not provide the circumference of the wheel, we cannot give a numerical answer. However, if we assume the circumference is known, the formula to find the speed in inches per second is \(\frac{C}{3}\).

If we assume a standard wheel circumference (for example, a bicycle wheel with a diameter of 26 inches has a circumference of approximately 81.68 inches), then the speed would be:
\[
\text{Speed in inches per second} = \frac{81.68}{3} \approx 27.23 \text{ inches per second}
\]

Therefore, the final answer, assuming a standard wheel circumference, is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senate committee consisting of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members of the Senate committee without any restrictions. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we need to subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists entirely of members from one party. There are two cases to consider: a subcommittee consisting entirely of Republicans and a subcommittee consisting entirely of Democrats.

The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 Republicans is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 Democrats is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Adding these two cases together, the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists entirely of members from one party is:

\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members to get the number of ways to form a subcommittee that includes at least one member from each party:

\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[

\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62

"To solve for the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\).
   - The altitude \(AM\) is 11.
   - Point \(D\) is on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\).
   - \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

2. **Define the angles:**
   - Let \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta\).

3. **Use the given angle relationship:**
   - \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC = 6\theta\).

4. **Analyze triangle \(BDC\):**
   - Since \(D\) is on \(AM\), \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).
   - In triangle \(BDC\), \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\), \(\angle DBC = 90^\circ - \theta\), and \(\angle DCB = 90^\circ - \theta\).

5. **Use the Law of Sines in triangle \(BDC\):**
   \[
   \frac{BC}{\sin 6\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin (90^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{BD}{\cos \theta} = \frac{CD}{\sin (90^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{CD}{\cos \theta}
   \]
   Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(D\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) in the isosceles triangle \(BDC\)), we have:
   \[
   BC = 2BD \sin 3\theta
   \]

6. **Use the Law of Sines in triangle \(ABM\):**
   \[
   \frac{AB}{\sin (90^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{AM}{\sin 2\theta} \implies \frac{AB}{\cos \theta} = \frac{11}{2 \sin \theta \cos \theta} \implies AB = \frac{11}{2 \sin \theta}

   Since \(AB = AC\), the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
   \[
   AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \left( \frac{11}{2 \sin \theta} \right) + 2BD \sin 3\theta

7. **Find \(BD\):**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(BDM\):
   \[
   BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 = \left( \frac{BC}{2} \right)^2 + 1^2 = \left( \frac{2BD \sin 3\theta}{2} \right)^2 + 1 = BD^2 \sin^2 3\theta + 1
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   BD^2 (1 - \sin^2 3\theta) = 1 \implies BD^2 \cos^2 3\theta = 1 \implies BD = \frac{1}{\cos 3\theta}

   Using the triple angle identity \(\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta\) and \(\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta\), we can find that \(\theta = 15^\circ\).

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. Given that the sum is \(3^7\), we first calculate \(3^7\):

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

The sum of 27 consecutive positive integers can be expressed as the sum of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \(a\) and the common difference is 1. The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)
\]

For our sequence, \(n = 27\), \(d = 1\), and \(S = 2187\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
2187 = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26)
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:

\[
2187 = \frac{27}{2} \cdot 2 (a + 13) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

Next, we solve for \(a\):

\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]

So, the first term \(a\) is 68. The 27 consecutive integers are:

\[

The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. To find the 14th term, we use the formula for the \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[
a_k = a + (k-1)d
\]

For the 14th term, \(k = 14\):

\[
a_{14} = 68 + (14-1) \cdot 1 = 68 + 13 = 81

"To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) holds, we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Since \( (x^2 + 2)^2 \) is a square, it is always non-negative, and the left part of the inequality \( 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 \) is always true for all real \( x \) except when \( x^2 + 2 = 0 \). However, \( x^2 + 2 = 0 \) has no real solutions because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \). Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:
\[ (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we get:
\[ -5 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we obtain:
\[ -7 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the left part of the inequality \( -7 < x^2 \) is always true. Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:
\[ x^2 < 3. \]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this equation as:
\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.\]
We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x + y + z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the identity, we get:
\[-8 = (x + y + z)\left((x + y + z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).\]

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
We also know that:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12.\]
Given that this expression equals 12, we have:
\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[sp = 24.\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(sp = 24\).

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}) = s^3 - 72.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which simplifies to
\[s^3 = 64.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[s = 4.\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(sp = 24\), we get:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (except at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but these points do not affect the sign of the inequality since they make the expression zero, not negative).

Now, let's determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

Since the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is non-negative and not zero in the interval \((0, 36)\), the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is negative in this interval.

Finally, we need to exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). However, these points are already excluded by the interval \((0, 36)\).

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the dimensions of the field. Let the length of the field be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters. The field is surrounded by a running track that consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

The length of each straight side is \( L \) meters, and the circumference of each semicircle is \( \pi W \) meters (since the diameter of each semicircle is \( W \) meters). Therefore, the total length of the track is:
\[
2L + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \pi W = 2L + \pi W
\]
We know that the total length of the track is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W \implies L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \cdot W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
We substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = 200 - 100 = 100
\]
Therefore, the dimensions of the field that maximize the area are \( L = 100 \) meters and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) meters. The maximum area is:
\[
A = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

Thus, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is:
   \[
   \text{opposite} = \sin{R} \times \text{hypotenuse} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
   \]

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the adjacent side \(ST\) is:

3. **Determine \(\sin{T}\):**
   In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side to that angle divided by the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by considering the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 equilateral triangle faces. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between any two opposite vertices is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

The key property we use here is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center.

However, for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is also equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the opposite vertices. Therefore, we can write:
\[
PA^2 + PF^2 = PB^2 + PE^2 = PC^2 + PD^2
\]

Given the distances \( PA = 3 \), \( PB = 7 \), \( PC = 8 \), \( PD = 9 \), and \( PE = 11 \), we need to find \( PF \). Using the property above, we can write:
\[
PA^2 + PF^2 = PC^2 + PD^2

Substituting the known values:
\[
3^2 + PF^2 = 8^2 + 9^2
\]
\[
9 + PF^2 = 64 + 81

\[

\[

"To solve the problem, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by acceleration (a). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[
F = m \cdot a
\]

In this scenario, we have two objects: a softball and a baseball. The masses of these objects are given as follows:

- Mass of the softball, \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \, \text{g} = 0.2 \, \text{kg} \)
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \, \text{g} = 0.15 \, \text{kg} \)

Jack throws the baseball with a certain force \( F \), and we want to find the acceleration \( a_{\text{softball}} \) of the softball when Jen throws it with the same force \( F \).

Using Newton's second law, we can express the acceleration for both objects:

1. For the baseball:
\[
F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \implies a_{\text{baseball}} = \frac{F}{m_{\text{baseball}}}
\]

2. For the softball:
\[
F = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \implies a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{F}{m_{\text{softball}}}
\]

Now, we can find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball:

\[
\frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{\frac{F}{m_{\text{softball}}}}{\frac{F}{m_{\text{baseball}}}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{softball}}}

Substituting the masses we have:

\[
\frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{0.15 \, \text{kg}}{0.2 \, \text{kg}} = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}

"To determine how many identical digits are present in the representations of the number \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder } 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder } 5

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[

\]
\[

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:

\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,

\[

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can express \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have:

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any vertex. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). For \(P\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:

- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).

62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money zaslužen is \$126.59.

Next, we convert this total amount to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we need to determine the largest possible amount that can be exchanged for banknotes. The largest banknote is a \$100 bill, which is 10000 cents. We divide the total amount by 10000 to find out how many \$100 bills can be exchanged:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{12659}{10000} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ banknote}
\]

So, they can exchange 1 banknote of \$100, which is 10000 cents. The remaining amount is:
\[
12659 - 10000 = 2659 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money left after they exchanged their total amount for banknotes is \(\boxed{2659}\) cents.","[2659, '2659']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average (arithmetic mean) score of the class on the test, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score for all the students:
- 20 students scored 80. So, the total score for these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- 8 students scored 90. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students scored 100. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add these total scores together to get the overall total score:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score:
\[\text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

Therefore, the average score of the class on the test is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sum of the numbers in each row must be the same, we equate the sum of the second row to the sum of the first row:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the columns and the diagonals:

The magic square becomes:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Let's check the sum of the columns:
- First column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

Let's check the sum of the diagonals:
- Main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"To determine how many fewer centimeters Jim travels compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim hoes diagonally across the field. The field is a rectangle with a width of 300 centimeters and a length of 400 centimeters. The distance Jim travels is the diagonal of this rectangle, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{Distance Jim travels} = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ centimeters}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha hoes along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:
\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ centimeters}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ centimeters}
\]

Therefore, Jim travels \(\boxed{200}\) centimeters fewer than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This means that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). The roots of \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\) are given by the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

So, the cube roots of unity are \(1\), \(\omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\), and \(\omega^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Note that \(\omega^2\) is the complex conjugate of \(\omega\), and they satisfy the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
