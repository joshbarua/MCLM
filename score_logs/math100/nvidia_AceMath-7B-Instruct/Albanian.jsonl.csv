"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \),
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{6i}{2} + i^2 \frac{6i}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can stand in a line such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not all stand together, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of arrangements and then subtracting the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do stand together.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of arrangements of 8 people.**

There are 8! (8 factorial) ways to arrange 8 people in a line. This is calculated as follows:
\[
8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas stand together.**

If Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas stand together, we can treat them as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) in a line. There are 6! ways to arrange these 6 ""people"". Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas stand together is:
\[
6! \times 3! = 720 \times 6 = 4320
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas stand together from the total number of arrangements.**

The number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not all stand together is:
\[
8! - 6! \times 3! = 40320 - 4320 = 36000

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can stand in a line such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not all stand together is \(\boxed{36000}\).","[36000, '36000']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = ((7k + 2) + 2)((7k + 2) + 4)((7k + 2) + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).
\]

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:
\[

\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

So, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) simplifies to:
\[

Now, calculate the product:
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the diagonals bisect each other, these midpoints must be the same. Therefore, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. If we assume \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(B\), then the midpoint of \(BD\) would be the same as the midpoint of \(AC\), but we need to check the other possible configuration.

Let's consider the case where \(D\) is the vertex opposite to \(A\). The midpoint of \(AD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of \(BC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
Since the diagonals bisect each other, these midpoints must be the same. Therefore, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we start by recalling the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute this into the tangent formula:

\[
\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A}

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is a part of the right triangle and cannot be zero), we can simplify the expression by canceling \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
   \]

   So, the solutions are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Here, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Here, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,

holds for all 2-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

\[

\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) defined as follows:

\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the two pieces of the function separately.

1. For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).
   - If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on this interval is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).
   - If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases, so it does not have a minimum value.

2. For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).
   - If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) decreases, so it does not have a maximum value.
   - If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) decreases, so it does not have a maximum value.

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of the function. The function \(f(x)\) must cover all real values, which means it must have no gaps in its range.

- If \(a > 0\), the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\), and the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For the function to cover all real values, the maximum value of the range for \(x < a\) must be at least as large as the minimum value of the range for \(x \geq a\). Therefore, we need \(a^2 + 2a \geq a^3\).
  - Rearranging the inequality, we get \(a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\).
  - Factoring out \(a\), we get \(a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\).
  - Factoring the quadratic expression, we get \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\).
  - The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Testing the intervals determined by these roots, we find that the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 0] \cup [2, \infty)\).
  - Since \(a > 0\), the valid interval is \(a \in [2, \infty)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) does not have a minimum value, and the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) does not have a maximum value, so the graph of \(y = f(x)\) does not cover all real values.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This inequality holds if and only if \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\) and \(y \neq x\). Since \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into the equation \(f(y) = x\):
\[
f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x \implies \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a quartic equation in \(x\). However, we can use the fact that \(x\) and \(y\) are roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 - (x+y)t + xy = 0\) and the fact that \(x\) and \(y\) are fixed points of the function \(f\) composed with itself but not of \(f\) itself.

From the fixed points, we know that \(x = 0\) or \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) are fixed points of \(f\). If \(x = 0\), then \(y = f(0) = 0\), which does not satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we consider \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

If \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(y = f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), which again does not satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\).

Therefore, we need to consider the other fixed points of \(f\) composed with itself. The fixed points of \(f\) composed with itself are the solutions to the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\) that are not fixed points of \(f\). These fixed points are the solutions to the equation:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This equation can be simplified to:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). The solutions to this equation must be in the interval \([0,1]\) and must not be equal to the fixed points of \(f\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f\) and the fixed points, we find that the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

"To find the mass \( m \) in grams of the object, we need to evaluate the given expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine. Recall that:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these identities, we can rewrite the numerator and the denominator of the expression.

The numerator is:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

This can be grouped as:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator is:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

This can be grouped as:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula, we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We know that \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities, we have:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]

Therefore, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) and \(\theta\) is the smallest positive angle is \(\theta = 120^\circ\).

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \).

Given that the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians, which is \( 2:3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( 2:3 \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Hence, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \). Since the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula again:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

"To find the two-digit positive numbers that are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to determine the common factors of these two numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:

"To determine the total surface area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

The diagram shows a grid of 1 by 1 squares, with some of them shaded. The shaded region consists of two right triangles and a rectangle. Let's identify each part and calculate its area step by step.

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so the expression becomes:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \sin^2 80^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 10^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \cdot 4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 10^\circ = 3 \sin^4 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]

We can use the double-angle identity \(\cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ - 1\) and \(\cos^2 10^\circ = \frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). Applying this identity, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[

The magnitude of this vector is:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Next, we substitute the known values \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = 7\) into the formula:

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \), so \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]
Next, recall the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + 2 + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.

Now, we need to find the values of \(\sec^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use known trigonometric values and identities to simplify the expression directly.

Consider the identity:

\]
For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = \frac{9}{4}.
\]
However, we need \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). We can use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = \frac{9}{4}.

"To determine if a polygon can be convex given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles in terms of the given information:**
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation and solve for \(n\):**
   Equate the sum of the interior angles to the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles must be less than \((n-2) \times 180^\circ + 180^\circ\), which simplifies to \((n-1) \times 180^\circ\). We can use this to find the range for \(n\).

   First, let's find the maximum possible value for \(n\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ + 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the maximum possible value for \(n\) is 8.

   Now, let's find the minimum possible value for \(n\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ > 1070^\circ
   \]
   \[
   n-2 > \frac{1070}{180}
   \]
   \[
   n-2 > 5.9444
   \]
   \[
   n > 7.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the minimum possible value for \(n\) is 8.

   Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8.

4. **Verify if a convex polygon with 8 sides can have the given sum of interior angles:**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ

   The sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), so the missing interior angle is:

\[ (t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. To determine which one is the correct solution, we check the inverse condition \( (t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \):

For \( t = 4 \):
\[ (4 + 2) \cdot 4 = 6 \cdot 4 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ (17 + 2) \cdot 17 = 19 \cdot 17 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Both values satisfy the condition, but the problem asks for the unique \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \). Since both 4 and 17 are valid, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement or context to determine the correct interpretation. However, based on the problem as stated, the unique solution is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic unit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of one side of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces of the cube.

**Step 1: Determine the length of one side of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the length of one side of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic unit, we have:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Since \( s = 1 \), the area of one face is:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \]

**Step 3: Find the total surface area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( SA \) is:
\[ SA = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{6}\) square units.","[6, '6']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). The product of a number and its conjugate can be found using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 25 - 3 = 22

For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:

\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula:
\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we compute \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

Simplifying the components, we get:
\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):
\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
   The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

2. **Calculate the number of integer points on the boundary:**
   - The top side of the rectangle is from \((-5,4)\) to \((5,4)\). The integer points on this side are \((-5,4)\), \((-4,4)\), \((-3,4)\), \((-2,4)\), \((-1,4)\), \((0,4)\), \((1,4)\), \((2,4)\), \((3,4)\), \((4,4)\), and \((5,4)\). There are 11 points.
   - The bottom side of the rectangle is from \((-5,-4)\) to \((5,-4)\). The integer points on this side are \((-5,-4)\), \((-4,-4)\), \((-3,-4)\), \((-2,-4)\), \((-1,-4)\), \((0,-4)\), \((1,-4)\), \((2,-4)\), \((3,-4)\), \((4,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\). There are 11 points.

   Adding these together, the total number of integer points on the boundary is:
   \[
   11 + 11 + 9 + 9 = 40
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of integer points inside the rectangle:**
   The number of integer points inside the rectangle is the total number of integer points in the grid from \((-5, -4)\) to \((5, 4)\) minus the number of integer points on the boundary. The total number of integer points in the grid is:
   \[
   (5 - (-5) + 1) \times (4 - (-4) + 1) = 11 \times 9 = 99

   Therefore, the number of integer points inside the rectangle is:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), \(\mathbf{w}\), and \(\mathbf{x}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times (\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{x}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}\). Applying this property, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Now, we substitute the given values of the cross products:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.

Substituting these values in, we get

\]

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is the same as the length of \(\overline{CD}\)) as \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) from vertex \(A\) to base \(\overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h.
\]

Next, we need to find the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(h\). Because \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem in \(\triangle ABD\). The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{AD}{CD} = \frac{a}{h}.
\]

However, we can also express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) and \(h\) using the area of the trapezoid. From the area formula, we have:
\[
(a + b)h = 84 \implies b = \frac{84}{h} - a.
\]

Now, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\overline{CD}\) is the base, we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h.
\]

To find \(h\), we use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is 42 and the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\overline{CD}\) is the base, we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h.
\]

Given that the area of the trapezoid is 42, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21.

   There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a specific order around the circle. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements.

2. **Determine the number of arrangements where the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect:**

Next, we calculate the area of the smaller circle:

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these two sectors:

"To determine how many cylindrical gotas are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical gotas and the spherical reservoir, and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical reservoir to the volume of one cylindrical gota.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical gota. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical gota, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical reservoir, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical gotas are needed to fill the spherical reservoir, we divide the volume of the spherical reservoir by the volume of one cylindrical gota:
\[ \text{Number of gotas} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical gotas needed to fill the spherical reservoir is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the committee:**
   The committee has a total of \(8 + 6 = 14\) members. The number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{14}{5}\):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   There are 8 Republicans, so the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is \(\binom{8}{5}\):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:**
   There are 6 Democrats, so the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is \(\binom{6}{5}\):

   This is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 Republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 Democrats:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[

"To find the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation is now:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 64 + 2 \implies x = 66

Solving the second equation:

\[
x - 2 = -64 \implies x = -64 + 2 \implies x = -62

"To solve for the perimeter of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\), we start by letting \(BC = a\) and \(AB = AC = b\). The point \(D\) on \(AM\) is such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, we note that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), so \(BM = MC = \frac{a}{2}\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle AMB\), we have:
\[
b^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]
Thus,
\[
b^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\). We can use the tangent function and the tangent triple angle identity to find a relationship between the sides of the triangle.

In \(\triangle BDC\), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \tan 6\theta = \frac{2 \tan 3\theta}{1 - \tan^2 3\theta}.
\]
Using the tangent double angle identity, we know:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3 \tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that in \(\triangle BDC\), the tangent of \(\angle BDC\) can also be expressed as:
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{a}{2}}{10} = \frac{a}{10}.
\]
In \(\triangle BAC\), the tangent of \(\angle BAC\) is:
\[
\tan \angle BAC = \tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{a}{2}}{11} = \frac{a}{11}.
\]
Using the tangent triple angle identity, we have:
\[
\tan 6\theta = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{a}{11}}{1 - \left(\frac{a}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{2a}{11}}{1 - \frac{a^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{2a}{11}}{\frac{121 - a^2}{121}} = \frac{2a \cdot 121}{11(121 - a^2)} = \frac{22a}{121 - a^2}.
\]
Setting this equal to \(\frac{a}{10}\), we get:
\[
\frac{22a}{121 - a^2} = \frac{a}{10}.
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
220a = a(121 - a^2).

Since \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):

The only way to distribute the exponent 7 among 27 integers is to have 26 of them equal to 1 and one equal to \(3^7\). This is because \(1 \times 1 \times \cdots \times 1 \times 3^7 = 3^7\).

2. **List the integers**: The 27 integers are \(1, 1, 1, \ldots, 1, 3^7\). There are 26 ones and one \(3^7\).

"To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) holds, we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), we can simplify this to:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:

Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies further to:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearranging terms, we get

\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the expression \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[

"To find the maximum area of the rectangular field enclosed by the running track, we need to consider the given information and break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the components of the track:**
   - The track consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends.
   - The total length of the track is 400 meters.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( L \) be the length of the rectangular field.
   - Let \( W \) be the width of the rectangular field, which is also the diameter of the semicircles.

3. **Express the perimeter of the track:**
   - The two straight sides contribute \( 2L \) to the perimeter.
   - The two semicircular ends together form a full circle with circumference \( \pi W \).
   - Therefore, the total perimeter of the track is \( 2L + \pi W \).

4. **Set up the perimeter equation:**
   \[
   2L + \pi W = 400
   \]

5. **Solve for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):**
   \[
   2L = 400 - \pi W
   \]
   \[
   L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
   \]

6. **Express the area of the field:**
   - The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by \( A = L \times W \).
   - Substitute the expression for \( L \) into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
   \]
   \[
   A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
   \]

7. **Find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area:**
   - To maximize the area, take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
   \]
   \[
   \pi W = 200
   \]
   \[
   W = \frac{200}{\pi}

   L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)
   \]
   \[
   L = 200 - 100
   \]
   \[
   L = 100
   \]

9. **Calculate the maximum area:**
   \[
   A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

Therefore, the maximum area of the field is \(\boxed{\frac{20000}{\pi}}\) square meters.","[20000/pi, '\\frac{20000}{\\pi}']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],True
"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2.

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x^2 + 4 = 25
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 21
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{21}
   \]
   So, the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) is \(\sqrt{21}\).

3. **Determine \(\sin{T}\):**
   In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side to that angle divided by the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is the adjacent side to angle \(R\), which is \(\sqrt{21}\), and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, we have:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors: \( x = 0 \) and \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution. Testing other possible rational roots or using numerical methods would show that there are no other real roots greater than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

The answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by considering the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Let the vertices of the octahedendron be \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \). The edge length of the octahedron is \( a \). The distance between any two opposite vertices (the length of the line segment connecting them) is \( a\sqrt{2} \).

Given that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the vertex \( F \).

Since \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite vertices, the distance \( AF = a\sqrt{2} \). Similarly, \( BE = a\sqrt{2} \) and \( CD = a\sqrt{2} \).

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices that do not form a face of the octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices plus twice the square of the edge length of the octahedron. This is a consequence of the symmetry and the geometric properties of the octahedron.

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) as \( x \). We can use the following equation based on the given distances:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 = x^2 + 11^2 + 2a^2
\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 = x^2 + 121 + 2a^2
\]
\[
203 = x^2 + 121 + 2a^2
\]
\[
82 = x^2 + 2a^2
\]

We also know that:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 11^2 = x^2 + 9^2 + 2a^2
\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 121 = x^2 + 81 + 2a^2
\]
\[
243 = x^2 + 81 + 2a^2
\]
\[
162 = x^2 + 2a^2
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \( 82 = x^2 + 2a^2 \)
2. \( 162 = x^2 + 2a^2 \)

However, there seems to be a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct geometric relationships. The correct approach is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices that do not form a face of the octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices plus twice the square of the edge length of the octahedron.

Given the correct distances, we can use the correct equation:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 = x^2 + 11^2
\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 = x^2 + 121
\]
\[
203 = x^2 + 121

82 = x^2

where the line is in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

\[ 2x - y - 2 = 0 \]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:

\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,

\[

We know that the sum of these expressions is equal to the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:

\]

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can simplify this expression. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and the expressions \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are symmetric sums of the roots. Therefore, the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - S_1t^2 + S_2t - S_3 = 0\) must be the values of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\).

Given that the sum of the roots is 0 and the product of the roots is 4 (since \(S_1S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 2^2 = 4\)), the roots of the polynomial are the solutions to \(t^3 - 4 = 0\), which are \(2, -1 + \sqrt{3}i,\) and \(-1 - \sqrt{3}i\).

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The vertices of the rectangle are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), and the sides \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel, as are \(AD\) and \(BC\). The ratio of the lengths of the sides is given by \(AB/AD = k\).

The point that is equidistant from the center \(O\) and any vertex is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the center to that vertex. Therefore, the region where a point is closer to the center than to any vertex is the region inside the rectangle but outside the four circles with centers at the vertices and radii equal to the distance from the center to the vertices.

The distance from the center \(O\) to any vertex is half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The length of the diagonal \(AC\) (or \(BD\)) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC = \sqrt{(AB)^2 + (AD)^2} = \sqrt{(k \cdot AD)^2 + (AD)^2} = AD \sqrt{k^2 + 1}
\]
Thus, the distance from the center \(O\) to any vertex is:
\[
\frac{AD \sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2}
\]

The area of each circle with radius \(\frac{AD \sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2}\) is:
\[
\pi \left(\frac{AD \sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \frac{(AD)^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]
Since there are four such circles, the total area of the four circles is:
\[
4 \cdot \pi \frac{(AD)^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4} = \pi (AD)^2 (k^2 + 1)
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
AB \cdot AD = k \cdot AD \cdot AD = k (AD)^2
\]

The area of the region where a point is closer to the center than to any vertex is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the four circles:
\[
k (AD)^2 - \pi (AD)^2 (k^2 + 1) = (AD)^2 (k - \pi (k^2 + 1))
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of this area to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{(AD)^2 (k - \pi (k^2 + 1))}{k (AD)^2} = \frac{k - \pi (k^2 + 1)}{k}
\]

However, we need to consider that the correct interpretation of the problem is that the point is closer to the center than to any vertex, which is the region inside the rectangle but outside the four circles. This region is actually the area of the rectangle minus the area of the four quarter-circles at each vertex, which is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the four circles divided by 4:
\[
\frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the correct probability is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}

"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\) by dividing 54 by 6:
\[
q = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]
Next, we use the quotient to find the remainder \(r\) by substituting \(q\) back into the division algorithm:
\[
54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
54 = 54 + r
\]
To isolate \(r\), we subtract 54 from both sides:
\[
r = 54 - 54 = 0
\]
Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, remains after converting the total amount of money from coins to dollar bills, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money won by all four players.
2. Convert the total amount from dollars to cents.
3. Determine the amount of money that will be left after converting the total amount to the largest possible dollar bills.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money won by all four players:
\[
\text{Linda's winnings} = \$27.47
\]
\[
\text{Sherry's winnings} = \$35.23
\]
\[
\text{June's winnings} = \$37.37
\]
\[
\text{Connie's winnings} = \$26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
\text{Total winnings} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money won is \$126.59.

Next, we convert this total amount to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much money will be left after converting the total amount to the largest possible dollar bills. The largest dollar bill is \$100, so we divide the total amount by 100 to find out how many \$100 bills we can get:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{126.59}{100} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ dollar bill}
\]
\[
1 \times 100 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting this amount from the total amount:
\[
126.59 - 100 = 26.59
\]

Finally, we convert the remaining amount to cents:
\[
26.59 \times 100 = 2659 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money that remains after converting the total amount to the largest possible dollar bills is \(\boxed{59}\) cents.","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students. Here are the steps:

1. Determine the total score of the students who scored 80. Since 20 students scored 80, the total score for these students is:
   \[
   20 \times 80 = 1600
   \]

2. Determine the total score of the students who scored 90. Since 8 students scored 90, the total score for these students is:
   \[
   8 \times 90 = 720
   \]

3. Determine the total score of the students who scored 100. Since 2 students scored 100, the total score for these students is:

   2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

4. Add up the total scores of all the students to get the overall total score:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

5. Divide the overall total score by the number of students in the class to find the average score:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal.

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3 + n+2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n-9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals must be equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, let's solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the other equation \( 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \):
\[
2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15
\]
\[
4(7) - 13 = 28 - 13 = 15
\]

Since both equations are satisfied, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how much shorter Martha's path is compared to Jim's, we need to calculate the distances each of them traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim traveled. Jim ecën diagonalisht përmes fushës, so the distance he traveled is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 këmbë and the width \(w\) is 300 këmbë. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ këmbë} \]
So, Jim's path is 500 këmbë.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha traveled. Martha arrin në të njëjtin vend duke ecur përgjatë gjatësisë dhe gjerësisë së saj, so the distance she traveled is the sum of the length and the width of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Distance} = l + w = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ këmbë} \]
So, Martha's path is 700 këmbë.

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ këmbë} \]
Therefore, Jim's path is 200 këmbë më shëndëhë se Martha's path. The answer is:

- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will now calculate the total distance for each starting point and each permutation of the other three points.

The minimum distance starting from \(A\) is \(13\).

3. \(B \to C \to A \to D\): \(BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
4. \(B \to C \to D \to A\): \(BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)
5. \(B \to D \to A \to C\): \(BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
6. \(B \to D \to C \to A\): \(BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\)

The minimum distance starting from \(B\) is \(13\).

**Starting from point \(C\):**

3. \(C \to B \to A \to D\): \(CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
4. \(C \to B \to D \to A\): \(CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
5. \(C \to D \to A \to B\): \(CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
6. \(C \to D \to B \to A\): \(CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\)

The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is \(13\).

2. \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
3. \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
4. \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
5. \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\)
6. \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)

The minimum distance starting from \(D\) is \(14\).

The overall minimum distance is the smallest of the minimum distances from each starting point, which is \(13\).
