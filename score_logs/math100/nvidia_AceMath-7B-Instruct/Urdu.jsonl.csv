"To find the length of \(DE\), we start by analyzing the given right triangle \(DEF\). We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of \(EF\) is 7. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:

\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this triangle, we have:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplifying the squares, we have:

\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To isolate \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:

\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), we can use the formula for rotation of a complex number. The rotation of a complex number \( z \) around another complex number \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \). The angle \( \theta \) is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

First, we need to find \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} + (-3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Next, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\pi/4} \):

\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We distribute the terms:

\[ = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]
\[ = \left( \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]
\[ = (1 + i) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]
\[ = (1 + i) - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = (1 + i) - 3i - 3i^2 \]
\[ = (1 + i) - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Now, we add this result to \( c \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table such that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rose, and Thomas) sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rose, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rose, and Thomas must sit next to each other, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Pierre-Rose-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

2. **Arrange the units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rose, and Thomas within their block**: Within their block, Pierre, Rose, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the arrangements**: To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units around the table by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rose, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table such that Pierre, Rose, and Thomas sit next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (since the constant term has no \(x\)). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = ((7k + 2) + 2)((7k + 2) + 4)((7k + 2) + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).
\]

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:
\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, calculate \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24,
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24.

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[

so
\[

"To determine how many degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to align with its original position, we need to understand the concept of rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, which means it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

Here are the steps to find the answer:

1. Identify the number of sides of the pentagon. A pentagon has 5 sides.
2. Calculate the angle of rotation by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides. This is because a full rotation is 360 degrees, and the pentagon will look the same after each rotation that is a fraction of 360 degrees corresponding to the number of sides.

The calculation is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Therefore, the pentagon must be rotated by at least \(\boxed{72}\) degrees to align with its original position.","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates of the fourth point \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth point are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid. Let's consider the other possible arrangement of the points.

If we take the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\), the midpoint is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth point are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid either.

Finally, let's consider the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\), and the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth point are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, so we solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Thus, the eigenvalues are:

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is:

"Let's denote the weight of one track as \( T \) and the weight of one ball as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

   3T = T + B

2. The weight of two tracks and one ball is equal to the weight of one track:

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
3T = T + B
\]
Subtract \( T \) from both sides:
\[
2T = B
\]
This gives us:
\[
B = 2T

### Step 2: Substitute \( B \) in the second equation
Now substitute \( B = 2T \) into the second equation:
\[
2T + 2T = T

This simplifies to:
\[

Subtract \( T \) from both sides:

### Step 4: Determine how many tracks equal the weight of one ball
Since both \( T \) and \( B \) are zero, we can conclude that any number of tracks will weigh the same as one ball, as both weights are zero.

Thus, the answer is that any number of tracks will weigh the same as one ball. However, if we are looking for a specific number of tracks that equals the weight of one ball, we can say:

First, we expand the product:

We distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:

\[

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a

We know this must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation:
\[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the relationship between the volume of water added to the tank and the rate at which the water level rises. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank. The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is given as \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the rate at which the water level is rising is given as 4 meters per hour. We can express these rates as:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

To find the radius, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) defined as follows:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \( x \geq a \)

For \( x \geq a \), the function is given by:

\[
f(x) = ax^2.
\]

This is a parabola that opens upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \). The vertex of this parabola occurs at \( x = 0 \), and the value of \( f(x) \) at this point is:

\[
f(0) = a \cdot 0^2 = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \( x < a \)

For \( x < a \), the function is given by:

\[
f(x) = ax + 2a.
\]

This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \). The value of \( f(x) \) at \( x = a \) is:

\[
f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the conditions for intersection with horizontal lines

To ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function at the point where the two pieces meet, which is at \( x = a \).

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - The parabola \( ax^2 \) opens upwards, and the line \( ax + 2a \) has a positive slope.
   - The function \( f(x) \) will intersect every horizontal line at most once if the line \( ax + 2a \) does not exceed the maximum value of the parabola \( ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - The parabola \( ax^2 \) opens downwards, and the line \( ax + 2a \) has a negative slope.
   - The function \( f(x) \) will intersect every horizontal line at most once if the line \( ax + 2a \) does not fall below the minimum value of the parabola \( ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \).

### Step 4: Find the maximum value of \( a \)

To find the maximum value of \( a \) such that the graph intersects every horizontal line at most once, we need to ensure that the line \( ax + 2a \) does not exceed the maximum value of the parabola \( ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \).

The maximum value of \( ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \) occurs at \( x = a \):

\[
f(a) = a^2.
\]

The value of \( f(x) \) at \( x = a \) for the linear part is:

\[
f(a) = a^2 + 2a.
\]

For the function to intersect every horizontal line at most once, we need:

\[
a^2 + 2a \leq a^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2a \leq 0 \implies a \leq 0.
\]

The largest value of \( a \) that satisfies the condition is \( a = 0 \). Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the radius of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) is 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (for \(\lambda \neq 0\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\). So, we need to solve the system:
\[
y = \lambda x(1 - x) \quad \text{and} \quad x = \lambda y(1 - y).
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) \implies x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) \implies x(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\)
2. \(1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0\).

The first case \(x = 0\) corresponds to the fixed point \(x = 0\), which we already know. We need to consider the second case:
\[
1 - \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Let's test the boundary values of \(x\):
- If \(x = 1\), then \(\lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda \cdot 1 + \lambda \cdot 1^2) = 0 \neq 1\). So, \(x = 1\) is not a solution.
- If \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(f(x) = x\), which is not what we want.

Now, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\) has a solution in \([0,1]\) other than the fixed points. This is a more complex analysis, but we can use the fact that the function \(f(x)\) is a quadratic function and its composition \(f(f(x))\) is a quartic function. The critical points of \(f(x)\) are \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), and the critical points of \(f(f(x))\) will be more complex but can be found by solving the derivative of \(f(f(x))\).

By analyzing the behavior of \(f(f(x))\) and the fixed points, we find that the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we can further simplify this. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression matches the tangent of a specific angle. By trial and error or using a calculator, we find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.

Therefore, the positive angle \(\theta\) is:

The formula to calculate the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":

- Frequency of E, \( n_1 = 2 \)
- Frequency of L, \( n_2 = 2 \)
- Frequency of I, \( n_3 = 1 \)
- Frequency of P, \( n_4 = 1 \)
- Frequency of S, \( n_5 = 1 \)
- Frequency of E (again), \( n_6 = 1 \)

Now substituting these values into the formula:

Thus, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

2. Count the multiples of \(5^2 = 25\) in the range from 1 to 42.
3. Count the multiples of \(5^3 = 125\) in the range from 1 to 42, and so on.

3. The multiples of 125 in the range from 1 to 42 are: none. There are \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0\) multiples of 125.

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only possible value is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This can be derived using the multiple-angle formula for cosine. Since \( \cos(5\theta) = -\cos\theta \), we have \( 5\theta = \pi - \theta + 2k\pi \) for some integer \( k \), or \( 6\theta = \pi + 2k\pi \), which simplifies to \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{3} \).

We need to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). Notice that \( 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \), so \( 85\theta = \theta + 14\pi \), and thus \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos\theta \). Therefore,

Given that the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians, which is \(2:3\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Hence, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the first equation to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula again:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",350,"[350, '350']",True

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) satisfy the condition that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as a perfect \( n \)-th power. This means there exists an integer \( k \) such that:

\[ 2^{24} = k^n \]

Taking the \( n \)-th root of both sides, we get:

"To determine how many necklaces Hillary has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of accessories Hillary has.
2. Determine the number of each type of accessory.
3. Calculate the number of necklaces based on the given information.

Step 1: Identify the total number of accessories Hillary has.
Hillary has 11 accessories in total.

Step 2: Determine the number of each type of accessory.
The problem states that all the accessories are either diameters or necklaces. Let's denote the number of diameters as \( D \) and the number of necklaces as \( N \). According to the problem, the total number of accessories is the sum of the diameters and the necklaces:
\[ D + N = 11 \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of necklaces.
The problem also states that the total cost of the accessories is 75 cents. Since the cost of each diameter and each necklace is not specified, we can assume that the cost of each diameter and each necklace is the same. Let's denote the cost of each diameter and each necklace as \( C \). The total cost of the accessories can be expressed as:
\[ (D + N) \times C = 75 \text{ cents} \]
Since \( D + N = 11 \), we can substitute 11 for \( D + N \):
\[ 11 \times C = 75 \text{ cents} \]
To find the cost of each accessory, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ C = \frac{75}{11} \text{ cents} \]
However, the cost of each accessory is not necessary to determine the number of necklaces. We only need to know that the total number of accessories is 11 and that they are either diameters or necklaces.

Since the problem does not provide any additional information about the number of diameters, we can conclude that the number of necklaces is simply the total number of accessories minus the number of diameters. But since the problem does not specify the number of diameters, we can assume that the number of necklaces is a part of the total 11 accessories.

Given that the problem asks for the number of necklaces and does not provide any additional constraints, we can assume that the number of necklaces is a part of the total 11 accessories. Therefore, the number of necklaces is:
\[ N = 11 - D \]
Since the problem does not specify the number of diameters, we can assume that the number of necklaces is a part of the total 11 accessories. Therefore, the number of necklaces is:
\[ N = 11 - 0 = 11 \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers selected by Pal and Jessica is even, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the even and odd numbers among the first six natural numbers:**
   The first six natural numbers are: \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\).
   - Even numbers: \(2, 4, 6\) (3 even numbers)
   - Odd numbers: \(1, 3, 5\) (3 odd numbers)

2. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**
   Since Pal and Jessica each select one number from the first six natural numbers, the total number of possible outcomes is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of favorable outcomes:**
   A favorable outcome is one where the sum of the selected numbers is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
   - Both numbers are even.
   - Both numbers are odd.
   
   **Scenario 1: Both numbers are even.**
   There are 3 even numbers, so the number of ways to select two even numbers is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
   
   **Scenario 2: Both numbers are odd.**
   There are 3 odd numbers, so the number of ways to select two odd numbers is:

   Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
   \[
   9 + 9 = 18

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the sum of the selected numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9.

Given that the number must consist only of the digits 0 and 1, the only way to satisfy the divisibility by 9 is if the sum of the digits is 9. Therefore, the number must contain exactly nine 1's and the rest 0's.

   - The first number is obtained by rolling a fair six-sided die and then dividing the result by 4.
   - The possible remainders when a number from 1 to 6 is divided by 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 0 (since 4, 5, and 6 give remainders 0, 1, and 2 respectively).

3. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - There are 4 possible remainders for the first number and 5 possible remainders for the second number.
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

4. **Identify the favorable outcomes:**
   - A square on the checkerboard is shaded if its row and column indices are both odd or both even.
   - The possible remainders for the column index (first number) are 1, 2, 3 (since 0 is even).

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x)\) is given by:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Let \(x = 20^\circ\), then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the given cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.

Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms:
\[

\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these expressions back into the original sum:

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

"To find the total surface area of a cube in square inches given that its volume is 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the volume in cubic inches is:
   \[
   1 \text{ cubic foot} = 12 \times 12 \times 12 = 1728 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   Let the side length of the cube be \( s \) inches. The volume of a cube is given by \( s^3 \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1728
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   s = \sqrt[3]{1728} = 12 \text{ inches}

3. **Calculate the total surface area of the cube:**
   The total surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6s^2

   Substituting the side length \( s = 12 \) inches, we get:
   \[
   A = 6 \times 12^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches}

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The radical conjugate of a number \(a + \sqrt{b}\) is \(a - \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, the radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 25 - 3 = 22

"To determine the 2003rd number in the sequence of odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we first recognize that this sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
For our sequence, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we have:

1. Calculate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from \( f(5) \).
3. Calculate \( g \) of the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Next, we need to express \(\sin(\tan^{-1}(x))\) and \(\cos(\tan^{-1}(x))\) in terms of \(x\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), which means we can form a right triangle with the opposite side \(x\) and the adjacent side 1. The hypotenuse of this triangle is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\). Therefore,

\[
\sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}.
\]

Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
2 \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(x^2 + 1)\):

\[
6x = x^2 + 1.
\]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}_1\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}_2\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1 \|}{\| \mathbf{d}_1 \|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the lines, and \(\mathbf{d}_1\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2\) are the direction vectors of the lines. Since the lines are parallel, \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so we can use \(\mathbf{d}_1\) in the formula.

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1 \|}{\| \mathbf{d}_1 \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Thus, the distance between the two lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie within the interior of the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
   The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

2. **Determine the range of \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates for the interior points:**
   The interior points must have \(x\) coordinates between \(-5\) and \(5\) (exclusive), and \(y\) coordinates between \(-4\) and \(4\) (exclusive). Therefore, the \(x\) coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\), and the \(y\) coordinates range from \(-3\) to \(3\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the properties of the cross product. The cross product is distributive over vector addition, so we can expand the expression as follows:

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circle and the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

First, let's visualize the circle and the points. When four points are chosen randomly on a circle, they can be arranged in any order around the circle. The key insight is that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we list the points in clockwise order, they must be in one of the following orders: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) or any cyclic permutation of these orders.

There are \(4!\) (24) possible ways to arrange the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) around the circle. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points. This gives us \(3!\) (6) possible arrangements for the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations). Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:

3. **Calculate the total area of the two circles:**
   The total area \(A_{\text{total}}\) is the sum of the areas of the larger and smaller circles:

5. **Identify the area of the sector of the larger circle that is part of the shaded region:**
   The shaded area includes the area of the smaller circle and a sector of the larger circle. Since the area of the smaller circle is \(\pi\), the area of the sector of the larger circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = A_{\text{shaded}} - A_{\text{small}} = \frac{5\pi}{3} - \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3} - \frac{3\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}

6. **Determine the central angle of the sector:**
   The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:

"To determine how many cylindrical barrels are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical barrels and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the volume of one barrel.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical barrel. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical barrel, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical barrels are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical barrel:
\[ \text{Number of barrels} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical barrels needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply the speed in feet per minute by 12.
2. Convert minutes to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide the speed in inches per minute by 60.

Let's start with the given speed of the bicycle, which is 20 feet per minute.

Step 1: Convert feet to inches.
\[ 20 \text{ feet/minute} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches/minute} \]

"To form a committee of 5 representatives from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that each party must be represented by at least one member, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Ways to Choose 5 Representatives**:
   The total number of ways to choose 5 representatives from 14 (8 + 6) is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!}

3. **Ways to Choose 5 from Only One Party**:
   - **All Republicans**: Choose 5 from 8 Republicans:

First, we calculate \(a - b\):

"Let the three consecutive numbers be \( x \), \( x+1 \), and \( x+2 \).

According to the problem, the product of these three numbers is 120:
\[
x(x+1)(x+2) = 120

Next, we need to find the average of these three numbers:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1
\]

Now, we divide the product by the average:
\[
\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = x(x+2)
\]

According to the problem, this division results in 24:
\[
x(x+2) = 24
\]

Now, we can solve the equation \( x(x+2) = 24 \):
\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\) for positive values of \(x\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**

   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:

   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

"To find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(AB = AC\), so triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\).
   - The altitude \(AM = 11\).
   - Point \(D\) on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

2. **Determine the length of \(DM\):**
   Since \(AM = 11\) and \(AD = 10\), we have:
   \[
   DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1.
   \]

3. **Use the tangent function to find \(\angle BAC\):**
   Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).
   In right triangle \(ABM\), we have:
   \[
   \tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11}.
   \]
   In right triangle \(BDM\), we have:
   \[
   \tan \left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{BM}{1}.

   Using the tangent triple angle identity, we know:
   \[
   \tan \left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{3\tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - \tan^3 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{1 - 3\tan^2 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.
   \]
   Let \(x = \tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\). Then:
   \[
   \frac{3x - x^3}{1 - 3x^2} = BM.
   \]
   From triangle \(ABM\), we have:
   \[
   BM = 11x.
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for \(BM\), we get:
   \[
   \frac{3x - x^3}{1 - 3x^2} = 11x.
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   3x - x^3 = 11x(1 - 3x^2) \implies 3x - x^3 = 11x - 33x^3 \implies 32x^3 = 8x \implies 4x^2 = 1 \implies x = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \implies \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.

   Using the double angle identity for sine, we get:
   \[
   \sin \theta = 2 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{4}{5}.

   Using the Pythagorean identity, we get:

4. **Find the length of \(AB\):**
   In right triangle \(ABM\), we have:
   \[
   \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} \implies \frac{3}{5} = \frac{BM}{AB} \implies BM = \frac{3}{5}AB.

   \[
   3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187

   So, the sum of the integers is 2187.

2. **Determine the median:**
   The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. Since there are 27 integers, the median will be the 14th number in the ordered list (because the position of the median in a list of \(n\) numbers is \(\frac{n+1}{2}\), and for \(n=27\), this is \(\frac{27+1}{2} = 14\)).

3. **Use the property of the sum and the median:**
   If we assume that the integers are as close to each other as possible, the median will be the value that, when multiplied by 27, gives a sum close to 2187. Let's denote the median by \(m\). If all 27 integers were equal to \(m\), their sum would be \(27m\). Since the actual sum is 2187, we have:

"To determine the real values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) holds, we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
We can complete the square for the quadratic expression in terms of \( x^2 \):
\[ (x^2)^2 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4. \]
So, the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21. \]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25. \]
Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ 0 < |x^2 + 2| < 5. \]
Since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always non-negative (because \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \)), we can simplify this to:
\[ 0 < x^2 + 2 < 5. \]
Subtracting 2 from all parts, we get:
\[ -2 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the inequality simplifies further to:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:

\[

2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:

2. \(12 = sp\).

Simplifying the first equation, we get:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Now, let's determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To minimize \(d\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:
\[

\]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}

   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

"To determine the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by analyzing the given distances from \( P \) to the five vertices of the octahedron. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given distances from \( P \) to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's denote the vertices as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite, \( B \) and \( E \) are opposite, and \( C \) and \( D \) are opposite. The distances from \( P \) to the vertices can be paired as follows:
- \( PA = 3 \) and \( PF = x \)
- \( PB = 7 \) and \( PE = y \)
- \( PC = 8 \) and \( PD = z \)

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant. This is a known property of regular polyhedra. Therefore, we can write:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = \text{constant} \]

Substituting the known distances:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant} \]
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = \text{constant} \]
\[ 324 + x^2 = \text{constant} \]

The constant is the same for any point \( P \) in space, so we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices is constant. Since the sum of the squares of the distances to the five vertices is 324 + x^2, the sum of the squares of the distances to the six vertices must be a constant value. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex must be such that the sum of the squares of the distances to all six vertices is constant.

Given that the sum of the squares of the distances to the five vertices is 324 + x^2, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex must be such that the sum of the squares of the distances to all six vertices is constant. Since the sum of the squares of the distances to the five vertices is 324 + x^2, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex must be such that the sum of the squares of the distances to all six vertices is constant.

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the formula for force, which is given by:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration (or rate of change of velocity, which is the same as the rate of change of speed in this context).

Since the force is the same for both the soft ball and the baseball, we can write:

\[ m_{\text{soft}} \cdot a_{\text{soft}} = m_{\text{base}} \cdot a_{\text{base}} \]

We are given the masses of the soft ball and the baseball as follows:
\[ m_{\text{soft}} = 200 \text{ grams} \]
\[ m_{\text{base}} = 150 \text{ grams} \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball, which is the same as the ratio of the rate of change of speed of the soft ball to the rate of change of speed of the baseball. This ratio is given by:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{soft}}}{a_{\text{base}}} = \frac{m_{\text{base}}}{m_{\text{soft}}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To determine how many digits are common between the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

### Step 3: Identify common digits
Now, we compare the digits in the base 7 representation \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation \(1165_8\).

The digits in \(1556_7\) are: \(1, 5, 6\)

The digits in \(1165_8\) are: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are: \(1, 5, 6\)

"To find the point on the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) that is closest to the point \( (6, 0) \), we need to find the perpendicular distance from the point to the line. The shortest distance from a point to a line is along the line perpendicular to the given line that passes through the point.

First, we find the slope of the given line \( y = 2x - 2 \). The slope is 2. The slope of the line perpendicular to this line is the negative reciprocal of 2, which is \( -\frac{1}{2} \).

Next, we write the equation of the line passing through the point \( (6, 0) \) with slope \( -\frac{1}{2} \). Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
\]

Now, we find the intersection of the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) and the line \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \). We set the equations equal to each other:
\[
2x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
\]
To clear the fraction, we multiply every term by 2:
\[
4x - 4 = -x + 6
\]
Adding \( x \) to both sides, we get:
\[
5x - 4 = 6
\]
Adding 4 to both sides, we get:
\[
5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
\[

Now, we substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the equation \( y = 2x - 2 \):
\[
y = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:

\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

First, we calculate the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we calculate the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We start by expressing \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so we use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and the polynomial is palindromic (i.e., the coefficients read the same forwards and backwards). This symmetry suggests that the roots can be paired such that the expressions \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are equal to the roots of a cubic polynomial whose coefficients are symmetric functions of the roots of the original polynomial.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the sum of the roots is zero, we can deduce that the roots of the cubic polynomial are \(2, -1, -1\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the last non-zero digit of the decimal point of the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to convert the fraction into its decimal form. We can do this by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

Let's carry out the division step by step:

1. \(500\) goes into \(137\) zero times, so we write \(0.\) and bring down a \(0\) to make it \(1370\).
2. \(500\) goes into \(1370\) two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)), so we write \(2\) and subtract \(1000\) from \(1370\) to get a remainder of \(370\).
3. Bring down another \(0\) to make it \(3700\).
4. \(500\) goes into \(3700\) seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)), so we write \(7\) and subtract \(3500\) from \(3700\) to get a remainder of \(200\).
5. Bring down another \(0\) to make it \(2000\).
6. \(500\) goes into \(2000\) four times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)), so we write \(4\) and subtract \(2000\) from \(2000\) to get a remainder of \(0\).

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the division is complete. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly selected point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The coordinates of the vertices can be taken as \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\), where \(a = \frac{AB}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{AD}{2}\). Given that \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The distance from a point \(P = (x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

For \(P\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2

\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the distances to the other vertices \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\):
\[
\text{ closer to } O \text{ than } B: \quad ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
\text{ closer to } O \text{ than } C: \quad -ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
\text{ closer to } O \text{ than } D: \quad -ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

These four inequalities define a region inside the rectangle that is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices. This region is a smaller rectangle with the same center \(O\) and sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle, but with half the length and half the width of the original rectangle.

\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.

Let's evaluate each point step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, calculate \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function. Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, calculate \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \). Since \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \), we have \( 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708 \).
   - Since \( 6.708 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function. Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, calculate \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (8^{1/3})^2 \). Since \( 8^{1/3} = 2 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function. Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Adding these amounts step by step:

Now, the largest note we can use is \$20, so we can use one \$20 note:
\[

Next, the largest note we can use is \$5, so we can use one \$5 note:

(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):
- The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]
- The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum is:
  \[
  3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]
- The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The other diagonal contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n+1 = 8 \). The sum is:
  \[
  2 + 5 + 8 = 15
  \]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how much farther Jam travels compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distances each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha walks along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jam travels. Jam walks along the perimeter of the field, which is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Since the field is a rectangle, the perimeter \(P\) is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Jam travels and the distance Martha travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 1400 - 500 = 900 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Jam travels \(\boxed{900}\) feet farther than Martha.","[900, '900']",200,"[200, '200']",False

"To find the minimum distance if we start from any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visit the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the shortest possible route.

The distances between the points are given as follows:
- \(AB = 6\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will evaluate the total distance for each starting point and each possible permutation of the other three points.

**Starting from point \(A\):**
1. \(A \to B \to C \to D\): \(AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\)
2. \(A \to B \to D \to C\): \(AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\)
3. \(A \to C \to B \to D\): \(AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)
4. \(A \to C \to D \to B\): \(AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\)
5. \(A \to D \to B \to C\): \(AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
6. \(A \to D \to C \to B\): \(AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)

The minimum distance starting from \(A\) is \(13\).

**Starting from point \(B\):**
1. \(B \to A \to C \to D\): \(BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16\)
2. \(B \to A \to D \to C\): \(BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\)
3. \(B \to C \to A \to D\): \(BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
4. \(B \to C \to D \to A\): \(BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)
5. \(B \to D \to A \to C\): \(BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
6. \(B \to D \to C \to A\): \(BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\)

The minimum distance starting from \(B\) is \(13\).

**Starting from point \(C\):**
1. \(C \to A \to B \to D\): \(CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15\)
2. \(C \to A \to D \to B\): \(CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)
3. \(C \to B \to A \to D\): \(CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
4. \(C \to B \to D \to A\): \(CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
5. \(C \to D \to A \to B\): \(CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
6. \(C \to D \to B \to A\): \(CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\)

The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is \(13\).

**Starting from point \(D\):**
1. \(D \to A \to B \to C\): \(DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
2. \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
3. \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
4. \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
5. \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\)
6. \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)

The minimum distance starting from \(D\) is \(14\).

The overall minimum distance is the smallest of the minimum distances from each starting point, which is \(13\).

Thus, the minimum distance is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
