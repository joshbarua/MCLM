"To find the length of \(DE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and that \(EF = 7\). Since \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we can write:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:

\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know \(DF = 10\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, \(EF\) is one leg, and \(DE\) is the other leg. Therefore, we can write:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\) into the equation, we get:

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplifying the squares, we have:

\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To isolate \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:

\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate the complex number \( z \) so that the center of rotation \( c \) is at the origin.**
2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise.**
3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.**

### Step 1: Translate the complex number \( z \) so that the center of rotation \( c \) is at the origin.

First, we find the difference between \( z \) and \( c \):
\[
z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
\]

### Step 2: Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise.

To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
\[
e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Now, we multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
\[
(\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} - 3i \frac{2}{2} - 3i^2 \frac{2}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
\]

### Step 3: Translate the rotated complex number back to the original coordinate system.

Now, we add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:
\[
w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
\]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:
\[
\boxed{6 - 5i}

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Now, we use the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
   \]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is a constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the constant term:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

We simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion is:

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible arrangement of the vertices. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is also not valid. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) where \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula with \(2\cos A\):

\[

\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\angle A\) is an acute angle in a right triangle), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

   This means \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

   This means \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,

   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\mathbf{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

Thus, we have:

2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45

Adding these values together:

So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0

Calculating each term:

To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

So, \(36\) in base 9 is \(40_9\).

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the weights of the tree, squig, and goolee.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one tree.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

We now have a system of three equations:
1. \( 2T = S \)
2. \( 10T = 3S + G \)
3. \( 2T + G = S \)

We can substitute the value of \( S \) from the first equation into the other two equations. From the first equation, we have \( S = 2T \).

Substitute \( S = 2T \) into the second equation:
\[

\[

\[

\[

Substitute \( S = 2T \) and \( G = 4T \) into the third equation:

This equation is not consistent, which suggests there might be a mistake in the problem statement or interpretation. However, if we re-evaluate the problem, we can see that the third equation should be consistent with the first two.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), so we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), so we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), so we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

"To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of the function \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function defined piecewise:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first piece \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x \geq a \).
2. **Behavior**: Since \( a \) is a constant, the function \( ax^2 \) is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).
3. **Minimum/Maximum**: 
   - If \( a > 0 \), the minimum value occurs at \( x = a \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]
   - If \( a < 0 \), the maximum value occurs at \( x = a \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]

### Step 2: Analyze the second piece \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Domain**: The domain for this piece is \( x < a \).
2. **Behavior**: This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \).
3. **Value at \( x = a \)**: The value of the function at \( x = a \) is:
   \[
   f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
   \]

### Step 3: Determine the conditions for intersection with horizontal lines

For the graph of \( f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, we need to ensure that:

1. The minimum (or maximum) value of the parabola \( ax^2 \) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of the linear function \( ax + 2a \) as \( x \) approaches \( -\infty \).
2. The maximum (or minimum) value of the linear function \( ax + 2a \) must be greater than or equal to the minimum (or maximum) value of the parabola \( ax^2 \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \).

### Step 4: Set up the inequalities

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - The minimum value of \( ax^2 \) is \( a^3 \).
   - The maximum value of \( ax + 2a \) as \( x \to -\infty \) is \( -\infty \) (since the slope is positive).
   - Thus, \( a^3 \) must be less than or equal to \( -\infty \), which is impossible.

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - The maximum value of \( ax^2 \) is \( a^3 \).
   - The maximum value of \( ax + 2a \) as \( x \to -\infty \) is \( -\infty \) (since the slope is negative).
   - Thus, \( a^3 \) must be less than or equal to \( -\infty \), which is also impossible.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since both cases lead to contradictions, we need to consider the case where \( a = 0 \):

- If \( a = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
  \[
  f(x) = 0 \quad \text{for all } x.
  \]
- In this case, the graph intersects every horizontal line (specifically \( y = 0 \)) at least once.

Thus, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the radius of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) is 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0, 4]\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0, 1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\), where the function \(f\) is defined as \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, let's start by finding the fixed points of the function \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). We solve the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0, 1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
The inequality \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\), and the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is always true for \(\lambda > 0\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in \([0, 1]\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0, 1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\), so \(y\) is also a fixed point of the function \(f\) composed with itself, but not a fixed point of \(f\). We already know the fixed points of \(f\), so \(y\) must be either \(0\) or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

If \(y = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\), which implies \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\). But \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f(1) = 0\), so \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\) are fixed points of \(f\), not solutions to \(f(x) \neq x\).

If \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). We need to solve:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x) = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative for \(x\) to be real:
\[
(\lambda^2)^2 - 4(\lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) = \lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2 = \lambda^2(\lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 4) = \lambda^2(\lambda - 2)^2.
\]
The discriminant is always non-negative, so the quadratic equation always has real solutions. However, we need to ensure that these solutions are in the interval \([0, 1]\) and that they are not equal to the fixed points \(0\) or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

The solutions to the quadratic equation are:
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda(\lambda - 2)}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda \pm (\lambda - 2)}{2\lambda}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = \frac{2\lambda - 2}{2\lambda} = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \quad \text{(which is a fixed point)} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{2}{2\lambda} = \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0, 1]\) and not equal to \(0\) or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), we need:
\[
0 < \frac{1}{\lambda} < 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The inequality \(0 < \frac{1}{\lambda} < 1\) is satisfied for \(\lambda > 1\), and the inequality \(\frac{1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \neq 1\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is a valid solution for \(\lambda > 1\).

"To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}\), we start by simplifying the expression in the numerator and the denominator.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms as follows:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan(A+B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) to simplify this. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ.
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we get:
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
The smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is \(\theta = 120^\circ\).

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count how many times the number 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) by considering the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc. (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on).

Here are the steps:

1. Count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   This means there are 8 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40).

2. Count the multiples of 25 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
   This means there is 1 multiple of 25 (25).

3. Count the multiples of 125 in the range from 1 to 42:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
   There are no multiples of 125 in this range.

Since higher powers of 5 will also contribute factors of 5, but there are no multiples of 125 or higher in the range, we stop here.

Adding up all the factors of 5, we get:
\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function in terms of trigonometric identities. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of the sine function is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only relevant solution is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This can be derived using the multiple-angle formula for cosine. Since \( \cos(5\theta) = -\cos(\pi - 5\theta) \), we have \( \cos(\pi - 5\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} \).

We can use the periodicity and symmetry properties of the cosine function to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). Notice that \( 85\theta = 17 \cdot 5\theta \). Since \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we have:

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units, we can substitute these values into the formula.

Here are the steps:

1. Identify the given values:

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

Therefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",350,"[350, '350']",True

"To find the positive two-digit integers that are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to determine the common factors of these two numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. The smallest power of these common prime factors is \(2^1\) and \(5^2\). Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:
\[ \text{GCD}(100, 150) = 2 \times 5^2 = 50 \]

The common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of their GCD, 50. Let's list the factors of 50:

We are only interested in the positive two-digit factors of 50. From the list above, the two-digit factors are:

"To determine for which positive integers \( n > 1 \) the statement that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power is true, we need to find the values of \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \).

First, we express \( 2^{24} \) as a perfect \( n \)-th power:
\[ 2^{24} = k^n. \]
This implies that \( k \) must be of the form \( 2^m \) for some integer \( m \), because the only prime factor of \( 2^{24} \) is 2. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ 2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn}. \]
By equating the exponents, we get:
\[ 24 = mn. \]
This means that \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \]
Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. Therefore, the possible values of \( n \) are:

Thus, the positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power are:

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the possible choices:**
   Paul and Jesse each choose a number randomly from the first six digits: \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\).

2. **Classify the numbers as even or odd:**
   - Even numbers: \(2, 4, 6\)
   - Odd numbers: \(1, 3, 5\)

3. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   Since each person has 6 choices, the total number of possible outcomes when both choose a number is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

4. **Count the number of favorable outcomes:**
   A favorable outcome is one where the sum of the two chosen numbers is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
   - Both numbers are even.
   - Both numbers are odd.

   **Scenario 1: Both numbers are even.**
   There are 3 even numbers, so the number of ways both Paul and Jesse can choose an even number is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

   **Scenario 2: Both numbers are odd.**
   There are 3 odd numbers, so the number of ways both Paul and Jesse can choose an odd number is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

   Adding these two scenarios together gives the total number of favorable outcomes:
   \[
   9 + 9 = 18
   \]

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
   \[
   \frac{18}{36} = \frac{1}{2}

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To find the value of \( b \) for the point \( (a, b) \) that lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

2. Solve for \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Now, we isolate \( 2b \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Finally, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","[100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,

"To determine the sum of the digits of the finite decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the expression. Notice that \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2 \cdot 2^7 = 10 \cdot (5 \cdot 2)^7 = 10 \cdot 10^7 = 10^8\). Therefore, the expression becomes \(\frac{4321}{10^8}\).

This fraction is simply the number 4321 followed by 8 zeros in the denominator, which means it is equal to 0.00004321. The digits of this decimal number are 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0. To find the sum of these digits, we add them together:

\[0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 10.\]

Thus, the sum of the digits of the finite decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",14,"[14, '14']",False
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use properties of the sine function and symmetry. First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so the expression becomes:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \sin^2 80^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 10^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \cdot 4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 10^\circ = 3 \sin^4 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]

We can use the double-angle identity \(\cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ - 1\) and \(\cos^2 10^\circ = \frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). Applying this identity, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Thus, the original product is:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{16}.
\]

Therefore, the value is:

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the properties of the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, we have:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \), so \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these identities back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]

Combine the constant terms:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\). However, a known result in trigonometry states that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9.
\]

Therefore, substitute this result back into the expression:
\[

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides. The formula is:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all interior angles of the polygon is \(1070^\circ + x\). Using the interior angle sum formula, we can write:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We can find the range for \(n\) by first finding the maximum possible value for \(180(n-2)\). If \(x\) is just less than \(180^\circ\), then \(180(n-2)\) is just greater than \(1070^\circ\). We start by solving the equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + 180
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
180(n-2) = 1250
\]

Dividing both sides by 180, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1250}{180} = \frac{125}{18} \approx 6.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 7. Therefore, \(n = 7\). To confirm, we calculate the sum of the interior angles of a heptagon:

\[
180(7-2) = 180 \times 5 = 900 \text{ degrees}
\]

If the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), then the missing angle \(x\) is:

\[
x = 180 \times 5 - 1070 = 900 - 1070 = -170
\]

This calculation shows that \(x\) is not a valid interior angle, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct approach is to find the correct \(n\) by ensuring the sum of the interior angles is slightly more than 1070 degrees. Let's try \(n = 7\):

\[
180(7-2) = 180 \times 5 = 900 \text{ degrees}
\]

This is not correct. Let's try \(n = 8\):

\[
180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080 \text{ degrees}
\]

If the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), then the missing angle \(x\) is:

\[
x = 180 \times 6 - 1070 = 1080 - 1070 = 10
\]

This is a valid interior angle. Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to find a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

Let's start by expressing this congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular square root of 2. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have two possible solutions: \( t = 4 \) (which is even) and \( t = 17 \) (which is odd). Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) that satisfies the conditions is:

"To find the surface area of a cube when its volume is given, we need to follow these steps:

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To find the value of the 2003rd term in the sequence of even numbers, we start by identifying the pattern of the sequence. The sequence given is \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), which is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
For our sequence, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

This simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.

Substituting these into the equation, we get

This simplifies to

Multiplying both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\), we obtain

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezoid \(ABCD\) where \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). We are also given that the area of the trapezoid \([ABCD] = 42\), and we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of the trapezoid can be expressed as:
\[

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h

To find \(h\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion (both share \(\angle BAC\) and \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\)). Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides is equal. Specifically, the ratio of the bases \(BC\) and \(AD\) is equal to the ratio of the heights from \(C\) to \(AB\) and from \(C\) to \(AD\), which is the same as the ratio of the bases \(BC\) and \(AD\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the height from \(C\) to \(AB\) is the same as the height from \(C\) to \(AD\), which is \(h\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h

We know that the total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are in the same ratio as the bases \(BC\) and \(AD\).

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, there are no restrictions on the order in which they are chosen. However, the order in which the points are chosen does not affect the probability of the chords intersecting, so we can consider the points as fixed once chosen.

2. **Determine the condition for the chords to intersect:**
   The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

3. **Calculate the number of favorable arrangements:**
   There are \(4!\) (24) possible ways to arrange the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a sequence. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points. This gives us \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) relative to \(A\).

   Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords intersecting (the alternating patterns mentioned above). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Since the total number of arrangements of the points relative to \(A\) is 6, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the shaded area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

3. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   The shaded area is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{large}} - A_{\text{small}} = 4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
   \]
   However, we are given that the shaded area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the shaded area is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Find the area of the sector of the larger circle that is not shaded:**
   The area of the sector of the larger circle that is not shaded is:
   \[
   A_{\text{unshaded}} = A_{\text{large}} - A_{\text{shaded}} = 4\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{12\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{7\pi}{3}
   \]

5. **Determine the central angle of the sector of the larger circle that is not shaded:**
   The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
   \]
   For the larger circle, the radius is 2, so the area of the sector is:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi
   \]
   Setting this equal to the unshaded area, we get:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi = \frac{7\pi}{3}
   \]
   Solving for \(\theta\):
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{7\pi}{3} \times \frac{1}{4\pi} = \frac{7}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \theta = \frac{7}{12} \times 360^\circ = 210^\circ
   \]

6. **Find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the supplementary angle to \(\theta\):
   \[
   \angle ADC = 360^\circ - 210^\circ = 150^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{150}\).","[150, '150']",120,"[120, '120']",False
"To determine how many cylindrical classes are needed to fill a spherical container, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical class and the spherical container and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical class. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical class, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical container, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical classes are needed to fill the spherical container, we divide the volume of the spherical container by the volume of one cylindrical class:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical classes} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical classes needed to fill the spherical container is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that each party must have at least one member, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee without any restrictions:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with no Republicans:**
   If there are no Republicans, then all 5 members must be Democrats. The number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 Democrats is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with no Democrats:**
   If there are no Democrats, then all 5 members must be Republicans. The number of ways to choose 5 members from 8 Republicans is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{6}{5} - \binom{8}{5} = 2002 - 6 - 56 = 1940

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):

a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, we need to find three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that their product is 120 and their arithmetic mean is 24 when the product is divided by 3. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Product of the integers:**
   \[
   abc = 120

2. **Arithmetic mean of the integers:**
   The arithmetic mean of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{a + b + c}{3}
   \]
   According to the problem, this mean is 24 when the product is divided by 3:
   \[
   \frac{abc}{3} = 24

   Substituting \(abc = 120\) into the equation, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x-2 = 64\)
2. \(x-2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is:

"To find the circumradius of the isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\), we start by letting \(BC = 2a\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we have \(BM = MC = a\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ABM\), we get:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + a^2 = 121 + a^2.
\]
Thus, the side length \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + a^2}\).

Next, we consider point \(D\) on the line segment \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Since \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

We use the tangent function to relate the angles. Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). The tangent of \(\angle BAC\) in triangle \(ABM\) is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{a}{11}.
\]
The tangent of \(\angle BDC\) can be found using the tangent triple angle formula:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta} = \frac{3\left(\frac{a}{11}\right) - \left(\frac{a}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3\left(\frac{a}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3a}{11} - \frac{a^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3a^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{3a \cdot 121 - a^3}{1331}}{\frac{121 - 3a^2}{121}} = \frac{363a - a^3}{1331} \cdot \frac{121}{121 - 3a^2} = \frac{a(363 - a^2)}{11(121 - 3a^2)}.
\]
In triangle \(BDC\), the tangent of \(\angle BDC\) is:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot DM} = \frac{2a}{2 \cdot 1} = a.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\tan 3\theta\), we get:
\[
a = \frac{a(363 - a^2)}{11(121 - 3a^2)}.
\]
Since \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[
1 = \frac{363 - a^2}{11(121 - 3a^2)}.
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
11(121 - 3a^2) = 363 - a^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
1331 - 33a^2 = 363 - a^2 \implies 968 = 32a^2 \implies a^2 = \frac{968}{32} = \frac{121}{4} \implies a = \frac{11}{2}.
\]
Now, we substitute \(a = \frac{11}{2}\) back into the expression for \(AB\):
\[
AB = \sqrt{121 + a^2} = \sqrt{121 + \left(\frac{11}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \frac{121}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{484}{4} + \frac{121}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{605}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{605}}{2} = \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
The circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\) is given by the formula:
\[
R = \frac{AB \cdot AC \cdot BC}{4K},
\]
where \(K\) is the area of the triangle. The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot AM = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2a \cdot 11 = 11a = 11 \cdot \frac{11}{2} = \frac{121}{2}.
\]
Substituting \(AB = AC = \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \(BC = 2a = 11\), we get:
\[
R = \frac{\left(\frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) \cdot 11}{4 \cdot \frac{121}{2}} = \frac{\frac{121 \cdot 5}{4} \cdot 11}{242} = \frac{\frac{605}{4} \cdot 11}{242} = \frac{6655}{968} = \frac{55}{8}.

"To find the median of 27 positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we first need to determine the value of \(3^7\). Calculating this, we get:

\[
3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187
\]

So, the sum of the 27 positive integers is 2187. The median of a set of 27 numbers is the 14th number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. To find the median, we need to consider the distribution of the numbers.

If we assume the numbers are as equal as possible, the median will be close to the average of the numbers. The average of the 27 numbers is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]

Since the numbers are positive integers, the median will be the 14th number in the ordered list. If the numbers are distributed as evenly as possible, the 14th number will be 81. To confirm, let's consider the following distribution:

If we have 13 numbers less than or equal to 81, 1 number equal to 81, and 13 numbers greater than or equal to 81, the sum will be:

\[
13a + 81 + 13b = 2187
\]

where \(a \leq 81\) and \(b \geq 81\). Simplifying, we get:

\[
13(a + b) + 81 = 2187
\]
\[
13(a + b) = 2106
\]
\[
a + b = 162
\]

Since \(a \leq 81\) and \(b \geq 81\), the only solution is \(a = 81\) and \(b = 81\). Therefore, the 14th number in the ordered list is 81.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Define a new variable \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -7)\).

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-7, 3)\).

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \((-7, 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we restrict \(y\) to \([0, 3)\). Thus, we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\).

Again, define \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[-4 < y^2 + 4y.\]
Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0.\]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[(y + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The root of the equation \((y + 2)^2 = 0\) is \(y = -2\). This root divides the real number line into two intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\) and \((-2, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -2)\), choose \(y = -3\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-3 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((- \infty, -2)\).

2. For \(y \in (-2, \infty)\), choose \(y = -1\):
\[(y + 2)^2 = (-1 + 2)^2 = (1)^2 = 1 > 0.\]
So, the inequality holds in \((-2, \infty)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) is \((-\infty, -2) \cup (-2, \infty)\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we restrict \(y\) to \([0, \infty)\). Thus, we have:
\[y > 0.\]
This means:
\[x^2 > 0,\]
which implies:
\[x \neq 0.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \quad \text{and} \quad x \neq 0.\]
In interval notation, this is:
\((- \sqrt{3}, 0) \cup (0, \sqrt{3}).\]

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use the identity for the sum of cubes and some algebraic manipulation.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this expression in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials. Notice that
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into this equation, we get
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12.\]
Adding 12 to both sides, we obtain
\[24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
\[24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p - p) = s(s^2 - 4p),\]
\[24 = sp.\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left( \left( \frac{24}{p} \right)^2 - 4p \right) = \frac{24}{p} \left( \frac{576}{p^2} - 4p \right) = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 4p^3}{p^2} = \frac{24(576 - 4p^3)}{p^3}.\]
Multiplying both sides by \(p^3\), we obtain
\[-8p^3 = 24(576 - 4p^3).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[-8p^3 = 13824 - 96p^3,\]
\[88p^3 = 13824,\]
\[p^3 = \frac{13824}{88} = 156.81818181818182,\]
\[p^3 = 144,\]
\[p = 6.\]

"To determine in which class the number of male bus drivers is closest to 135% of the number of female bus drivers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of male bus drivers in each class.
2. Calculate the number of female bus drivers in each class.
3. Determine the ratio of male bus drivers to female bus drivers for each class.
4. Find the class where this ratio is closest to 135%.

Let's start with the calculations:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of male bus drivers in each class
- **9th class**: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\) male bus drivers.
- **10th class**: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103\) male bus drivers.
- **11th class**: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62\) male bus drivers.
- **12th class**: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35\) male bus drivers.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of female bus drivers in each class
- **9th class**: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118\) female bus drivers.
- **10th class**: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\) female bus drivers.
- **11th class**: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\) female bus drivers.
- **12th class**: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26\) female bus drivers.

### Step 3: Determine the ratio of male bus drivers to female bus drivers for each class
- **9th class**: \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.0424\).
- **10th class**: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.0404\).
- **11th class**: \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.5122\).
- **12th class**: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.3462\).

- **10th class**: \(1.0404\).
- **11th class**: \(1.5122\).
- **12th class**: \(1.3462\).

The ratio closest to 1.35 is \(1.3462\), which corresponds to the 12th class.

Therefore, the class where the number of male bus drivers is closest to 135% of the number of female bus drivers is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero.

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the denominator in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the track, we need to analyze the given track shape, which consists of two straight segments and two semicircular ends. The total length of the track is 400 meters, which is the sum of the lengths of the two straight segments and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

Let's denote the length of each straight segment by \( L \) meters and the radius of each semicircle by \( R \) meters. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi R \), so the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( 2 \pi R \). Therefore, the total length of the track can be expressed as:
\[
2L + 2\pi R = 400
\]
We can simplify this equation to:
\[
L + \pi R = 200
\]
Solving for \( L \), we get:
\[
L = 200 - \pi R
\]

The area \( A \) of the track is the sum of the areas of the two rectangles formed by the straight segments and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of one rectangle is \( L \times 2R \), so the total area of the two rectangles is \( 2L \times 2R = 4LR \). The area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 \), so the total area of the two semicircles is \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 = \pi R^2 \). Therefore, the total area of the track can be expressed as:
\[
A = 4LR + \pi R^2
\]
Substituting \( L = 200 - \pi R \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = 4(200 - \pi R)R + \pi R^2 = 800R - 4\pi R^2 + \pi R^2 = 800R - 3\pi R^2
\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( R \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dR} = 800 - 6\pi R
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
800 - 6\pi R = 0
\]
Solving for \( R \), we get:
\[
R = \frac{800}{6\pi} = \frac{400}{3\pi}
\]
To confirm that this value of \( R \) gives a maximum, we can check the second derivative of \( A \):
\[
\frac{d^2A}{dR^2} = -6\pi
\]
Since the second derivative is negative, the function \( A \) has a maximum at \( R = \frac{400}{3\pi} \).

Substituting \( R = \frac{400}{3\pi} \) back into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = 800 \left( \frac{400}{3\pi} \right) - 3\pi \left( \frac{400}{3\pi} \right)^2 = \frac{320000}{3\pi} - 3\pi \left( \frac{160000}{9\pi^2} \right) = \frac{320000}{3\pi} - \frac{160000}{3\pi} = \frac{160000}{3\pi}

"To determine \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sides of the triangle:**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{5}\), the side opposite to angle \(R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the adjacent side:**
   Let the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). According to the Pythagorean theorem:

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices of one pair of opposite faces is equal to the sum of the distances to the vertices of the other pair of opposite faces. This property can be extended to any point outside the octahedron as well.

Let the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( F \) be \( x \). Since \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), the sum of the distances from \( P \) to \( A \) and \( F \) is equal to the sum of the distances from \( P \) to any other pair of opposite vertices. Therefore, we can write:

First, we calculate the sum of the distances to the vertices \( B, E, C, \) and \( D \):

\[ 7 + 8 + 9 + 11 = 35 \]

Since the sum of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is twice the sum of the distances to any three pairs of opposite vertices, we have:

\[ 3 + x + 7 + 8 + 9 + 11 = 2 \times 35 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

Let the acceleration of Jen's ball be \( a_J \) and the acceleration of Jack's ball be \( a_{Jack} \).

According to Newton's second law, the force applied to Jen's ball is \( F = m_J a_J \) and the force applied to Jack's ball is \( F = m_{Jack} a_{Jack} \). Since the force is the same for both balls, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 a_J = 150 a_{Jack} \]

To find the ratio of Jen's ball acceleration to Jack's ball acceleration, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_{Jack}} \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_{Jack}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of Jen's ball kiirenduse to Jack's ball kiirenduse is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}\).","[3/4, '\\frac{3}{4}']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine how many numbers are common in the representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\) in bases 7 and 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
\begin{align*}
629 \div 7 &= 89 \quad \text{remainder } 6 \\
89 \div 7 &= 12 \quad \text{remainder } 5 \\
12 \div 7 &= 1 \quad \text{remainder } 5 \\
1 \div 7 &= 0 \quad \text{remainder } 1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we find that:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

Next, we convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8 using a similar method.

\[
\begin{align*}
629 \div 8 &= 78 \quad \text{remainder } 5 \\
78 \div 8 &= 9 \quad \text{remainder } 6 \\
9 \div 8 &= 1 \quad \text{remainder } 1 \\
1 \div 8 &= 0 \quad \text{remainder } 1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we find that:

\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Identify common numbers

Now we have the representations of \(629_{10}\) in both bases:

- In base 7: \(1556_7\)
- In base 8: \(1165_8\)

To find common numbers, we need to check if there are any digits that appear in both representations. The digits in base 7 are \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\) and the digits in base 8 are \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\).

The common digits between the two bases are \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\).

### Step 4: Count the common digits

Now we count the digits that appear in both representations:

- From \(1556_7\): The digits are \(1, 5, 6\).
- From \(1165_8\): The digits are \(1, 1, 6, 5\).

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of common digits in the representations of \(629_{10}\) in bases 7 and 8 is:

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This can be done by moving all terms to one side of the equation:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the value of the expression \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:

\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

We know that the sum of these expressions is equal to the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product of these expressions. We use the identity for the product of sums of products of roots:

\[
S_1S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product is quite complex, so instead, we use the fact that the roots of the polynomial can be expressed in a specific form. The polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) can be factored as:

\[
(x^2 + x + \sqrt{3}i)(x^2 + x - \sqrt{3}i) = 0.
\]

The roots of these quadratic equations are:

\[
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm 1}{2} = 0, -1,
\]
\[
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-7}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{7}i}{2}.
\]

Thus, the roots are \(\alpha_1 = 0\), \(\alpha_2 = -1\), \(\alpha_3 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{7}i}{2}\), and \(\alpha_4 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{7}i}{2}\). Now we can calculate the expressions \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\):

\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \cdot (-1) + \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{7}i}{2}\right)\left(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{7}i}{2}\right) = 0 + \frac{1 + 7}{4} = 2,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = 0 \cdot \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{7}i}{2}\right) + (-1) \cdot \left(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{7}i}{2}\right) = 0 + \frac{1 + \sqrt{7}i}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{7}i}{2},
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0 \cdot \left(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{7}i}{2}\right) + (-1) \cdot \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{7}i}{2}\right) = 0 + \frac{1 - \sqrt{7}i}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{7}i}{2}.
\]

Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). The vertices of the rectangle are then \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is given by:
\[
d(O, (x, y)) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d(A, (x, y)) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

This inequality represents a line that divides the plane into two regions. The region satisfying \(ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\) is the region closer to the vertex \(A\). Similarly, we can find the regions closer to the other vertices \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

The lines \(ax - by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\), \(ax + by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\), \(-ax + by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\), and \(-ax - by = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\) form a smaller rectangle inside \(ABCD\) whose center is also \(O\). The side lengths of this smaller rectangle are \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{smaller rectangle}} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \cdot \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The area of the larger rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{larger rectangle}} = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside \(ABCD\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the larger rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{smaller rectangle}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{larger rectangle}}} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2}

This tells us that 6 can fit into 54 exactly 9 times. Next, we multiply 6 by 9 to find the product:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second column:

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third column:

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right):
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13

And the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left):
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6

For the matrix to be a magic square, all these sums must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, let's solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7

Next, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the other equations. Substitute \( n = 7 \) into \( 2n + 1 \):

Substitute \( n = 7 \) into \( 3n - 6 \):

"To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This implies that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 1\), \(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:

   - \(C \to A \to D \to B\): \(CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)
   - \(C \to B \to A \to D\): \(CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(C \to B \to D \to A\): \(CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
   - \(C \to D \to A \to B\): \(CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
   - \(C \to D \to B \to A\): \(CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\)
   The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is \(13\).

4. **Starting from point \(D\):**
   - \(D \to A \to B \to C\): \(DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
   - \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\)
   - \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
   The minimum distance starting from \(D\) is \(14\).

The shortest distance among all the minimum distances calculated is \(13\). Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled by starting from any one of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
