"To find the value of \( DE \) given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \( \sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} \).

Given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \( EF \) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \( DF \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( DF \) and then divide by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know \( DF = 10 \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( DE \). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this triangle, \( DF \) is the hypotenuse, \( EF \) is one leg, and \( DE \) is the other leg. Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \( DF \) and \( EF \) into the equation, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \( DE^2 \), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the value of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Let \( z' = z - c \). Then,
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i.
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by \( z'' = z' e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore,
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right).
   \]
   We can expand this product as follows:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6\sqrt{2}i}{2} + \frac{6\sqrt{2}i^2}{2} \right) = (1 + i) - (3i - 3) = 4 - 2i.
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   Let \( w = z'' + c \). Then,
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i.
   \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then use the properties of square roots. Let's start with the prime factorization of 242.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, we need to factorize 121. Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check if 121 is divisible by 11. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

3. Now, we use the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table ronde such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the term constant in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is zero (i.e., the term is constant). Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this exponent equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Next, we calculate \((10x^3)^2\):

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{6} = 100x^6
\]

Then, we calculate \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}
\]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot \left(-12.5\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) and then simplify the expression modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each factor modulo 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder of 4 when divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder of 6 when divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder of 8 when divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.

Finally, find the remainder of 24 when divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,

so
\[

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise around its center to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

Here are the steps to find the solution:

1. Identify the total degrees in a full rotation: \(360^\circ\).
2. Determine the number of sides of the pentagon: \(5\).
3. Calculate the minimum angle of rotation by dividing the total degrees by the number of sides: \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the other possible diagonal.

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Again, \(x = 4\) is not a valid solution because \(x > 7\). Let's consider the last possible diagonal.

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Since \(x = 8 > 7\), this is a valid solution. Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\).

Finally, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To find the value of \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine.

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

\[

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is in the denominator and cannot be zero), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes, the horizontal asymptote, and then sum the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Sum the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)
We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

This is the definition of the cotangent function, \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of one squig.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Dix treeks pèsent autant que trois squigs et un goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Deux treeks et un goolee sont égaux en poids à un squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to eliminate \( G \) from these equations. First, solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

Combine like terms on the right side:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to isolate the terms involving \( T \) on one side:
\[
12T = 4S
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{4S}{12} = \frac{S}{3}

Thus, the weight of one treek is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the weight of one squig. Therefore, the weight combiné de combien de treeks équivaut au poids d'un squig is:

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form should match the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
We distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We now compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step. From the fourth equation, we solve for \(a\):
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]
Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation and solve for \(b\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]
Now we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the second equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8

The second equation is satisfied. Finally, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the third equation to verify:
\[

The third equation is also satisfied. Therefore, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

The value of \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the reservoir is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour.

We can use the chain rule to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height. Differentiating the volume formula with respect to time, we get:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we have:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To solve for \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):

\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two parts: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the part of the function where \(x \geq a\):
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) on this interval is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

Next, consider the part of the function where \(x < a\):
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and if \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing. The value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left is \(f(a^-) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must be all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) on \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, and the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) must cover all values below \(a^2 + 2a\).

If \(a > 0\), the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) has a minimum value of \(a^3\) and the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is increasing. For the graph to intersect every horizontal line, \(a^3\) must be less than or equal to \(a^2 + 2a\):
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Factoring out \(a\) from the right-hand side, we get:
\[ a^3 \leq a(a + 2). \]
Since \(a > 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[ a^2 \leq a + 2. \]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic inequality:
\[ a^2 - a - 2 \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ (a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The solutions to this inequality are:
\[ -1 \leq a \leq 2. \]
Since \(a > 0\), we have:
\[ 0 < a \leq 2. \]
The largest value of \(a\) in this range is \(a = 2\).

If \(a < 0\), the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) has a maximum value of \(a^3\) and the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is decreasing. For the graph to intersect every horizontal line, \(a^3\) must be greater than or equal to \(a^2 + 2a\):
\[ a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a. \]
Factoring out \(a\) from the right-hand side, we get:
\[ a^3 \geq a(a + 2). \]
Since \(a < 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\) and reverse the inequality:
\[ a^2 \geq a + 2. \]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic inequality:
\[ a^2 - a - 2 \geq 0. \]

\[ a \leq -1 \quad \text{or} \quad a \geq 2. \]

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). These are the solutions to the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if \(\lambda \neq 0\)). Note that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in the interval \([0,1]\) if and only if \(1 \le \lambda \le 2\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\), so \(y\) is a fixed point of \(f^{-1}(x)\). Since \(f\) is a quadratic function, \(f(f(x)) = x\) implies that \(f(x)\) is a root of the equation \(f(t) = x\).

We already know the fixed points of \(f\), so we need to consider the case where \(x\) is not a fixed point but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(f(x)\) must be a fixed point of \(f\) other than \(x\). Therefore, \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) if \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Substituting \(f(x) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we get:
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = \lambda x(1 - x).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 = \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
For this quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant \(\Delta\) is given by:
\[
\Delta = (-\lambda^2)^2 - 4(\lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) = \lambda^4 - 4\lambda^3 + 4\lambda^2 = \lambda^2(\lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 4) = \lambda^2(\lambda - 2)^2.
\]
Since \(\lambda^2 \ge 0\) and \((\lambda - 2)^2 \ge 0\), the discriminant is always non-negative. Therefore, the quadratic equation always has real solutions.

However, we need to ensure that these solutions are in the interval \([0,1]\) and that they are not equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). The solutions to the quadratic equation are:
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 \pm \lambda(\lambda - 2)}{2\lambda^2} = \frac{\lambda \pm (\lambda - 2)}{2\lambda}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = \frac{2\lambda - 2}{2\lambda} = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \quad \text{(which is a fixed point)} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{2}{2\lambda} = \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
The solution \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is in the interval \([0,1]\) if and only if \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, for \(\lambda \ge 1\), there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Thus, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator is \(\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ\).

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator is \(\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ\).

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this expression. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula for \(\tan 40^\circ\):
\[
\tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sin 40^\circ}{\cos 40^\circ} = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.

The maximum value of \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\) is 1, which occurs when \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi\) for any integer \(k\).

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the given equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, we can deduce that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle and its medians.

1. **Identify the properties of the centroid \( G \):**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Determine the area of triangle \( AGC \):**
   Since \( G \) divides the median \( AD \) in the ratio 2:1, the area of triangle \( AGC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the area of triangle \( ADC \). Similarly, the area of triangle \( ADC \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \) because \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( AGC \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AGC = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 144 = \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48

3. **Determine the area of triangle \( ENG \):**
   The line passing through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( ENG \) and \( EBC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the median, which is \( 1:3 \). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles \( ENG \) and \( EBC \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} \).

   The area of triangle \( EBC \) is the same as the area of triangle \( ABC \) because they share the same base \( BC \) and height. Therefore, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is:

Let's start with the initial number of books on each shelf:
- The top shelf has 8 mystery books.
- The middle shelf has 10 math books.
- The bottom shelf has 6 science books.

The total number of books initially is:
\[ 8 + 10 + 6 = 24 \]

Next, we remove 2 books from each shelf:
- The top shelf now has \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) books.

The number of math books remaining is 8. To find the fraction of the remaining books that are math books, we divide the number of math books by the total number of remaining books:

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

3. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

Given that the number must consist only of the digits 0 and 1, and it must end in 00 to be divisible by 25, the sum of the digits of the number (which is the number of 1's in the number) must be divisible by 9. The smallest such number is 9, so the number must contain exactly 9 ones.

Therefore, the smallest number consisting of only the digits 0 and 1, ending in 00, and having exactly 9 ones is \(11111111100\).

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,

\[

\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x)\) is given by:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Let \(x = 20^\circ\), then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r-5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \), so \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To calculate the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these expressions back into the original sum:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]
Combine the constant terms:
\[
= 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\):
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

To find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\tan^2 20^\circ\), and \(\tan^2 40^\circ\), we use the triple angle identity for tangent:
\[
\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}.
\]
For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 10^\circ\), but we don't need to solve it explicitly. Instead, we use known values and properties of tangent to find the sum of the squares of the tangents.

Using known results from trigonometry, we have:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 9.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 9 = 12.

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Determine the measure of the missing interior angle:**
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is also equal to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

4. **Find the range for \(x\):**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must be less than \(180^\circ\).

5. **Estimate the value of \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the approximate value of \(n\) by assuming \(x\) is close to \(0\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   n \approx 7
   \]

6. **Verify the value of \(n\):**
   If \(n = 7\), the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
   \]
   This is less than \(1070^\circ\), so \(n\) must be greater than 7.

   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   This is greater than \(1070^\circ\), so \(n\) must be less than 8.

   Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is 7.

   The number of sides in the polygon is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",8,"[8, '8']",False
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the property of modular inverses. If \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, then we have:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \) is symmetric around 0 modulo 23):

\[ 1^2 = 1 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 = 4 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 = 9 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 = 16 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two possible solutions for \( t \):

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = 17 \). Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is:

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we first need to recognize that this sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
For our sequence, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our equation, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the equation becomes

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We use the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, we have

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). We know that

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.

Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3},

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3(1+x^2)\):

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we compute the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

We can simplify each term individually. First, note that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression becomes

We perform the scalar multiplications:

\[

\[

"To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the trapezoid \(ABCD\). We know that \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is equal to the length of \(\overline{CD}\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

To find \(h\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the base \(a\) of \(\triangle ACD\) is part of the total base \(a + b\) of the trapezoid. However, we need to find the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\) to proceed.

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{CD}\) as one of its legs. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed in terms of the total area of the trapezoid and the ratio of the bases. Because \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have the same height, and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid if \(b = 0\) (which is not the case here, but the ratio of the areas is still useful).

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid if we consider the height and the base \(a\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

Since \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid and the area of the trapezoid is 42, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid if we consider the height and the base \(a\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2

1. Identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\). Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\).
2. Substitute these values into the definition of the operation @:

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form one segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the other segment. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]
   However, a simpler way to think about it is to consider the permutations of the points and then divide by the number of ways to arrange the segments, which is \(2!\). So, the number of ways to pair the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!2} = 3
   \]

2. **Determine the number of ways the segments can intersect:**
   For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). There are exactly 2 such arrangements out of the 6 possible pairings.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[

"To determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The radius of the smaller circle is 1, so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The total area of the two circles is:
\[
4\pi + \pi = 5\pi
\]
The area of the region ombrée is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the region ombrée is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The region ombrée consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi = \frac{4\pi \theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ}
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ}

The total area of the region ombrée is the sum of these two areas:

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical reservoir and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical reservoir, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical reservoir, we divide the volume of the spherical reservoir by the volume of one cylindrical beaker:
\[ \text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, the expression becomes \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the angle addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha)
\]

This is a product of two binomials, which can be expanded as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \sin \alpha \cos \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
= \sin \alpha \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta + \sin^2 \beta \cos^2 \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta
\]

Notice that the terms \(\sin \alpha \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta\) and \(-\cos \alpha \sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta\) cancel each other out. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
= \sin^2 \beta \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta
\]

We know that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\):
\[
\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84
\]
\[
\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin^2 \beta \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta = 0.5^2 \cdot 0.84 - 0.4^2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 \cdot 0.84 - 0.16 \cdot 0.75 = 0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

Specifically, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos x \cos (60^\circ - x) \cos (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \cos 3x.

We can rewrite the angles in our expression in terms of \(60^\circ\):

We can pair the cosines as follows:

\[
\cos \left( 24^\circ \right) \cos \left( 96^\circ \right) \cos \left( 48^\circ \right) \cos \left( 168^\circ \right).

Using the identity \(\cos (180^\circ - x) = -\cos x\), we have \(\cos \left( 168^\circ \right) = -\cos \left( 12^\circ \right)\) and \(\cos \left( 96^\circ \right) = -\cos \left( 84^\circ \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

AB = \frac{11}{\cos \theta} \quad \text{and} \quad x = AB \sin \theta = \frac{11 \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = 11 \tan \theta.
\]
So, \(BC = 2x = 22 \tan \theta\).

Next, consider \(\triangle BDC\). Since \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) with \(AD = 10\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). In \(\triangle BDC\), we use the Law of Sines:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]
However, we can use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and the properties of the triangle to find a relationship between the sides. Using the tangent triple angle identity, we have:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}.
\]
We also know that in \(\triangle BDC\), \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\), we can express \(BD\) and \(CD\) in terms of \(BC\) and \(\theta\).

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the configuration of the triangle and the point \(D\) implies a specific geometric relationship. By symmetry and the given conditions, we can deduce that \(\theta = 30^\circ\). Therefore,
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
Thus,
\[
x = 11 \tan 30^\circ = 11 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]
So, \(BC = 2x = 2 \cdot \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3}\).

Now, we find \(AB\):
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\cos 30^\circ} = \frac{11}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{22}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{66\sqrt{3}}{3} = 22\sqrt{3}.
\]
Thus, the perimeter of the triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers and then finding the median.

First, let's denote the 27 consecutive integers as:
\[a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\]
where \(a\) is the smallest integer in the sequence.

The sum of these 27 integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right)
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. Here, \(n = 27\), \(d = 1\), so the sum is:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{27}{2} \left(2a + 26\right) = 27 \left(a + 13\right)
\]
We know that the sum of these 27 integers is \(3^7\). Therefore, we have:
\[
27 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 \left(a + 13\right) = 3^7
\]
Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:
\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]
Solving for \(a\), we find:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
So, the 27 consecutive integers are:
\[68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\]
The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. Therefore, the median is:
\[
a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81
\]
Thus, the median of these 27 consecutive integers is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes a quadratic inequality in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic expression as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). The quadratic expression \((y + 7)(y - 3)\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
So, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Next, let's consider the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\). We can rewrite this as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0.\]
We can factor this expression as:
\[(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0.\]
The expression \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number and is always non-negative, except when \(x^2 + 2 = 0\). However, \(x^2 + 2 = 0\) has no real solutions because \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Therefore, \((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\) for all real \(x\).
So, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is:
\[-\infty < x < \infty.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we get the intersection of the intervals \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\) and \(-\infty < x < \infty\), which is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and manipulations.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute this value into the identity:
\[12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\)
2. \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).\)

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\)
2. \(12 = sp.\)

From the second equation, we can solve for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{12}{p}.\]
Substitute this into the first equation:
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\left(\frac{12}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = \frac{12}{p}\left(\frac{144}{p^2} - 3p\right) = \frac{12}{p} \cdot \frac{144 - 3p^3}{p^2} = \frac{12(144 - 3p^3)}{p^3} = \frac{1728 - 36p^3}{p^3} = \frac{1728}{p^3} - 36.\]
Rearrange to get
\[-8 + 36 = \frac{1728}{p^3},\]
which simplifies to
\[28 = \frac{1728}{p^3}.\]
Solving for \(p^3\), we get
\[p^3 = \frac{1728}{28} = \frac{432}{7}.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = \sqrt[3]{\frac{432}{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}}.\]

However, we need to check if this value is consistent with the original equations. Instead, let's re-evaluate the problem with a simpler approach. Notice that if we assume \(x = y = z\), then \(xyz = x^3 = 4\) implies \(x = \sqrt[3]{4}\). Substituting \(x = y = z = \sqrt[3]{4}\) into the other equations, we get:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3x^3 = 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \neq 4,\]
which is a contradiction. Therefore, \(x, y, z\) are not all equal.

Instead, let's use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try to find a simpler solution. From the equation \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\), we can test simple integer values. If we assume \(x = 2, y = 1, z = 2\), then:
\[xyz = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4,\]
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 2^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 = 8 + 1 + 8 = 17 \neq 4,\]
which is another contradiction. Therefore, we need to find another approach.

Finally, let's use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try to find a simpler solution. From the equation \(12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\), we can test simple integer values. If we assume \(x = 2, y = 2, z = 1\), then:
\[xyz = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 4,\]
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 2^3 + 2^3 + 1^3 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \neq 4,\]
which is another contradiction. Therefore, we need to find another approach.

"To determine for which level the number of boys taking the bus is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls taking the bus, we need to calculate the number of boys and girls taking the bus for each level and then find the level where the ratio of boys to girls taking the bus is closest to \(135\%\).

First, let's calculate the number of boys and girls taking the bus for each level:

1. **9th level:**
   - Number of boys taking the bus: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3 \approx 123\)
   - Number of girls taking the bus: \(300 \times 0.394 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls taking the bus: \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.0424\)

2. **10th level:**
   - Number of boys taking the bus: \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2 \approx 103\)
   - Number of girls taking the bus: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls taking the bus: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.0404\)

3. **11th level:**
   - Number of boys taking the bus: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8 \approx 62\)
   - Number of girls taking the bus: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls taking the bus: \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.5122\)

4. **12th level:**
   - Number of boys taking the bus: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8 \approx 35\)
   - Number of girls taking the bus: \(300 \times 0.086 = 25.8 \approx 26\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls taking the bus: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.3462\)

- For the 12th level, the ratio is \(1.3462\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The sign of \(x(x-36)\) changes at these roots. We can test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so their product \(x(x-36)\) is positive.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero in this interval. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum area of the rectangular field, we need to consider the total length of the track and how it is composed of the straight sides and the semi-circular ends. The track consists of two straight sides of length \( L \) meters each and two semi-circular ends with a total circumference equal to the circumference of one full circle with radius \( R \) meters. The total length of the track is given by:

\[ 2L + 2\pi R = 400 \]

We can simplify this equation to:

\[ L + \pi R = 200 \]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by the product of its length \( L \) and its width, which is equal to the diameter of the circle, \( 2R \):

\[ A = L \cdot 2R \]

We can express \( L \) in terms of \( R \) using the equation \( L + \pi R = 200 \):

\[ L = 200 - \pi R \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:

\[ A = (200 - \pi R) \cdot 2R = 400R - 2\pi R^2 \]

To find the value of \( R \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( R \) and set it to zero:

\[ \frac{dA}{dR} = 400 - 4\pi R \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[ 400 - 4\pi R = 0 \]
\[ 4\pi R = 400 \]
\[ R = \frac{100}{\pi} \]

Now, we substitute \( R = \frac{100}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):

\[ L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The area \( A \) is then:

\[ A = L \cdot 2R = 100 \cdot 2 \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\) and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is \(2\).

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Next, we expand and simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We take the derivative of \( f(x) \) and set it to zero to find the critical points:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

The solutions to this equation are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Since there are no other rational roots and no real roots greater than 3, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

From the above, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:

Given that the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \) such that \( A_1 \) is opposite to \( A_4 \), \( A_2 \) is opposite to \( A_5 \), and \( A_3 \) is opposite to \( A_6 \).

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center.

However, for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is also equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the opposite vertices. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices.

Let \( d_6 \) be the distance from \( P \) to \( A_6 \). Then, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 = (3^2 + 9^2) + (7^2 + 11^2) + (8^2 + d_6^2)
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d_6^2 = 324 + d_6^2
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
(9 + 81) + (49 + 121) + (64 + d_6^2) = 90 + 170 + 64 + d_6^2 = 324 + d_6^2
\]

Since both sides are equal, we can conclude that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is consistent. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is the same as the distance from \( P \) to the opposite vertex of the given distances. The only distance that is not given is the one that is opposite to the distance 11, which is 11.

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"Pour résoudre ce problème, nous allons utiliser la formule de la force en physique, qui est exprimée par :

\[
F = m \cdot a
\]

 où \( F \) est la force, \( m \) est la masse et \( a \) est l'accélération.

On sait que Jen et Jack appliquent la même force pour lancer leurs bouches. Donc, nous pouvons écrire :

\[
F_{\text{Jen}} = F_{\text{Jack}}
\]

Soit :

\[
m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}}
\]

On a les masses des bouches :

- Masse de la balle de softball (Jen) : \( m_{\text{Jen}} = 200 \, \text{g} = 0.2 \, \text{kg} \)
- Masse de la balle de baseball (Jack) : \( m_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \, \text{g} = 0.15 \, \text{kg} \)

En substituant ces masses dans l'équation, nous obtenons :

\[
0.2 \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = 0.15 \cdot a_{\text{Jack}}
\]

Pour isoler \( a_{\text{Jen}} \), nous divisons les deux côtés par \( 0.2 \):

\[
a_{\text{Jen}} = \frac{0.15}{0.2} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}}

Calculons \( \frac{0.15}{0.2} \):

\[
\frac{0.15}{0.2} = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}

"To determine how many identical digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder } 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder } 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder } 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we find that:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder } 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder } 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder } 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we find that:

\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations

Now we have the two representations:

- Base 7: \(1556_7\)
- Base 8: \(1165_8\)

Next, we identify the digits in each representation:

- Digits in \(1556_7\): \(1, 5, 6\)
- Digits in \(1165_8\): \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

### Step 4: Find the common digits

The common digits between the two sets are:

- From \(1556_7\): \(1, 5, 6\)
- From \(1165_8\): \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

### Step 5: Count the number of common digits

The common digits \(1, 5, 6\) appear in both representations. Thus, the number of identical digits is:

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0).
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2.
\]

Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2.

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where the line is represented in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form. This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, we have the following relationships among the roots:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can express \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product, we get:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2.
\]

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2.
\]

Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = -2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 = -2 \cdot 0 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 = \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2.
\]

Using \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we get:
\[
\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 = \left(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2},
\]
\[
\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 = \left(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2},
\]
\[
\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 = \left(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_4}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2}.

Thus,
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \frac{4}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2} + \frac{4}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2} + \frac{4}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2} = 4 \left(\frac{\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2}\right) = 4 \left(\frac{\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2}{4}\right) = \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 = 4.

Let \( c \) be the cost of one crayon in dollars and \( e \) be the cost of one jumbo eraser in dollars. We can then set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. \( 3c + e = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5c + e = 1.82 \)

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's define the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). Assume the rectangle has dimensions \(2a \times 2b\), where \(a = \frac{AB}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{AD}{2}\). The center \(O\) is at the origin \((0,0)\), and the vertices are \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if its distance to \(O\) is less than its distance to any vertex. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\). For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

\[

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:

"To determine how much money, in centimes, remained after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie converted as many pieces of currency as possible into bills, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they earned.
2. Determine how many pieces of currency they have in total.
3. Convert as many pieces of currency as possible into bills.
4. Calculate the remaining amount of money in centimes.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money they earned.**

Linda earned \$27.47.
Sherry earned \$35.23.
June earned \$37.37.
Connie earned \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 = 126.60
\]

So, the total amount of money they earned is \$126.60.

**Step 2: Determine how many pieces of currency they have in total.**

To find the total number of pieces of currency, we need to consider the smallest unit of currency, which is a cent. We convert each amount to cents:
\[
27.47 \text{ dollars} = 2747 \text{ cents}
\]
\[
35.23 \text{ dollars} = 3523 \text{ cents}
\]
\[
37.37 \text{ dollars} = 3737 \text{ cents}
\]
\[
26.52 \text{ dollars} = 2652 \text{ cents}
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652 = 12660 \text{ cents}
\]

So, the total number of pieces of currency they have is 12660 cents.

**Step 3: Convert as many pieces of currency as possible into bills.**

Assuming the smallest bill is a dollar bill (100 cents), we can convert as many pieces of currency as possible into bills:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{12660}{100} \right\rfloor = 126 \text{ bills}
\]

Converting 126 bills back into cents:
\[
126 \text{ bills} \times 100 \text{ cents/bill} = 12600 \text{ cents}
\]

So, the amount of money converted into bills is 12600 cents.

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount of money in centimes.**

Subtract the amount converted into bills from the total amount of money:
\[
12660 \text{ cents} - 12600 \text{ cents} = 60 \text{ cents}

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

The first row contains the numbers \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
The second row contains the numbers \( n+2 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
The third row contains the numbers \( 2 \), \( n \), and \( n-1 \). Therefore, the sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \):
- The first column contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( n+2 = 9 \), and \( 2 = 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 9 + 2 = 15
  \]
- The second column contains the numbers \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n = 7 \). The sum is:
  \[
  3 + 5 + 7 = 15
  \]
- The third column contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 1 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 1 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right contains the numbers \( n-3 = 4 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( n-1 = 6 \). The sum is:
  \[
  4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  \]
- The main diagonal from the top right to the bottom left contains the numbers \( n+1 = 8 \), \( 2n-9 = 5 \), and \( 2 \). The sum is:
  \[
  8 + 5 + 2 = 15
  \]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many fewer feet Jim marches compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim crosses the field diagonally. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha walks along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is:
\[
400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Jim marches \(\boxed{200}\) fewer feet than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega \neq 1\) and \(\omega^2 \neq 1\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, we combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
