"To find the length of \(DE\) given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the given value of \(EF\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To solve for \(DF\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then divide by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know \(DF = 10\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, so:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\) into the equation, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) to the rotated complex number:
   \[
   4 - 2i + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

So, the prime factorization of 242 is \(2 \times 11^2\).

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor separately:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ways we can select 3 out of 8 workers to receive a gold crown, given that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must all be included in the selection. Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are already fixed in the selection, we only need to choose the remaining 0 workers from the remaining 5 workers (since 8 - 3 = 5).

The number of ways to choose 0 workers from 5 workers is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{0} \), which is always 1. Therefore, there is only 1 way to select the remaining workers.

Thus, the total number of ways to select 3 workers out of 8 such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all included is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",720,"[720, '720']",False

"To determine when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7, we start with the given condition that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\). This means that \(n\) can be written in the form \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\).

We substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[

For a graph with \( n \) vertices, the minimum number of edges required to disconnect the graph is \( n-1 \). This is because a graph with \( n-1 \) edges can be a tree, and a tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Removing any one edge from a tree will disconnect it.

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From this, we get two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x = 8 > 7\), the value of \(x + y\) is:

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now that we have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \), we can find \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can break it down into smaller steps and use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1.\]

We can use the identity for the sum of a geometric series. The expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\), the common ratio \(r = 99\), and the number of terms \(n = 3\). The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[S = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}.\]

For our series, this becomes:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1} = \frac{99^3 - 1}{98}.\]

Next, we need to calculate \(99^3\):
\[99^3 = 99 \times 99 \times 99.\]

First, calculate \(99 \times 99\):
\[99 \times 99 = 9801.\]

Now, multiply the result by 99:
\[9801 \times 99 = 9801 \times (100 - 1) = 9801 \times 100 - 9801 = 980100 - 9801 = 970299.\]

So, \(99^3 = 970299\). Now substitute this back into the expression:
\[\frac{99^3 - 1}{98} = \frac{970299 - 1}{98} = \frac{970298}{98}.\]

Finally, perform the division:

holds for any two-dimensional vector \(\mathbf{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

Next, we simplify the first term \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite the second term with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

1. Let the weight of one squig be \( S \).
2. Let the weight of one treek be \( T \).
3. Let the weight of one goolee be \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total weight of three squigs and one goolee is equal to the weight of three treeks and one goolee.
2. The weight of two treeks and one goolee is equal to the weight of one squig.

We can express these relationships as equations:
1. \( 3S + G = 3T + G \)
2. \( 2T + G = S \)

First, let's simplify the first equation by subtracting \( G \) from both sides:
\[ 3S = 3T \]
Next, divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = T \]

Now we know that the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of one treek. Substitute \( T \) with \( S \) in the second equation:
\[ 2S + G = S \]
Next, subtract \( S \) from both sides:
\[ S + G = 0 \]
Then, subtract \( S \) from both sides:
\[ G = -S \]

Now we know that the weight of one goolee is equal to the negative weight of one squig. To find the total weight of three squigs, we multiply the weight of one squig by 3:

"To solve for \(a\) and \(b\) in the given polynomial equation, we start by multiplying the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) and then equating the result to the polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now equate this polynomial to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step. From equation 4, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1 and solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

We now verify these values of \(a\) and \(b\) in equations 2 and 3. Substituting \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

The equation holds true. Substituting \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

The equation holds true. Therefore, the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Finally, we find \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To find the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is given by:

\[ 2\pi r = 20\pi \]

To solve for \( r \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 2\pi \):

\[ r = \frac{20\pi}{2\pi} = 10 \]

Thus, the radius of the tank is \(\boxed{10}\) meters.","[10, '10']",\sqrt{5},[],False
"To find the maximum value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) defined piecewise:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the first piece \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \)

1. **Behavior for \( x \geq a \)**:
   - The function \( f(x) = ax^2 \) is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \).
   - The vertex of this parabola occurs at \( x = 0 \), but since we are only considering \( x \geq a \), we need to evaluate \( f(a) \):
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
     \]

2. **As \( x \to \infty \)**:
   - If \( a > 0 \), \( f(x) \to \infty \).
   - If \( a < 0 \), \( f(x) \to -\infty \).

### Step 2: Analyze the second piece \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \)

1. **Behavior for \( x < a \)**:
   - This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \).
   - The value at \( x = a \) is:
     \[
     f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
     \]

2. **As \( x \to -\infty \)**:
   - If \( a > 0 \), \( f(x) \to -\infty \).
   - If \( a < 0 \), \( f(x) \to \infty \).

### Step 3: Determine the conditions for intersection with horizontal lines

For the graph of \( f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, we need to ensure that:

- The minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x < a \) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq a \).

### Step 4: Set up the inequality

1. **For \( a > 0 \)**:
   - The minimum value of \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \) is \( f(a) = a^2 + 2a \).
   - The maximum value of \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( f(a) = a^3 \).
   - We need:
     \[
     a^2 + 2a \leq a^3.
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0.
     \]
   - Factoring out \( a \):
     \[
     a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0.
     \]
   - The quadratic \( a^2 - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1) \) gives roots at \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -1 \).
   - The inequality \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0 \) holds for \( a \in (-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2] \).

2. **For \( a < 0 \)**:
   - The maximum value of \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \) is \( f(a) = a^2 + 2a \).
   - The minimum value of \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( f(a) = a^3 \).
   - We need:
     \[
     a^2 + 2a \geq a^3.
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.
     \]
   - This is the same inequality as before, but we need to consider \( a < 0 \).

### Step 5: Conclusion

The maximum value of \( a \) that satisfies the condition for \( a > 0 \) is \( a = 2 \). For \( a < 0 \), the maximum value is \( a = 0 \) (not valid since \( a < 0 \)).

Thus, the maximum value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ 34 - 1 = c \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) and there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

The fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (assuming \(\lambda \neq 0\)). We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(x\) is not a fixed point but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]

Since \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(x = \frac{y}{\lambda(1 - y)}\) into \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\):

\[ y = \lambda \left( \frac{y}{\lambda(1 - y)} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{y}{\lambda(1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y}{1 - y} \left( \frac{\lambda(1 - y) - y}{\lambda(1 - y)} \right) = \frac{y(\lambda - \lambda y - y)}{\lambda(1 - y)^2} = \frac{y(\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y)}{\lambda(1 - y)^2}. \]

Multiplying both sides by \(\lambda(1 - y)^2\), we get:

\[ \lambda y(1 - y)^2 = y(\lambda - (\lambda + 1)y). \]

Assuming \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[ \lambda (1 - y)^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y. \]

Expanding and simplifying, we have:

\[ \lambda (1 - 2y + y^2) = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda - 2\lambda y + \lambda y^2 = \lambda - (\lambda + 1)y, \]
\[ \lambda y^2 - 2\lambda y + (\lambda + 1)y = 0, \]
\[ y(\lambda y - 2\lambda + \lambda + 1) = 0, \]
\[ y(\lambda y - \lambda + 1) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ y = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

If \(y = 0\), then \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point. If \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), then \(x = \frac{\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}}{\lambda \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}}{\lambda \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda}} = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), which is also a fixed point. Therefore, \(y = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is not a valid solution for a periodic point of period 2.

However, we need to check the condition \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) and ensure that \(f(f(x)) = x\) has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). This occurs when the quadratic equation \(\lambda y^2 - 2\lambda y + (\lambda + 1) = 0\) has a solution \(y \in [0,1]\) other than the fixed points. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:

\[ \Delta = (-2\lambda)^2 - 4\lambda(\lambda + 1) = 4\lambda^2 - 4\lambda^2 - 4\lambda = -4\lambda. \]

For the quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative, but \(-4\lambda\) is non-negative only if \(\lambda \le 0\), which is not in the range \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\). Therefore, the only valid solution is when \(\lambda = 4\), which gives us the fixed points \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{3}{4}\).

Thus, the value of \(\lambda\) is:

"To find the value of \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\) to rewrite the expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
So, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
The angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is \(-60^\circ\) or \(120^\circ\). Since we are asked for the positive angle, we have:
\[
\theta = 120^\circ.
\]
Thus, the answer is:

"To find the value of \(42!\), we need to calculate the product of all integers from 1 to 42. The factorial of a number \(n\), denoted as \(n!\), is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \(n\). Therefore, \(42!\) is the product of all integers from 1 to 42.

The exact value of \(42!\) is a very large number. Using a calculator or a computer program to compute it, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function in terms of trigonometric substitutions. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, the function becomes:

\[
f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \), the only relevant solution is \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( \phi = 0 \), or \( \theta = 0 \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). In either case, we have \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 1 \) and \( y = \sin 0 = 0 \), or \( x = \sin 0 = 0 \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 1 \). Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle formed by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) is half the magnitude of the cross product of these vectors.

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}

The cross product is given by:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). This implies that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and thus the given equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, we know that \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos(10\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). By further trigonometric identities and properties of the golden ratio, we can deduce that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of the centroid and similar triangles. The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

Given that the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \), we can use the fact that \( \triangle AMN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is the same as the ratio of the segments into which \( G \) divides the medians, which is \( 2:3 \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

Since the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 144, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64

Next, we need to find the area of \( \triangle ENG \). Since \( \triangle ENG \) is similar to \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle AMN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \), we need to determine the ratio of the sides of \( \triangle ENG \) to \( \triangle AMN \). The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) divides \( \triangle AMN \) into two smaller triangles, \( \triangle ENG \) and \( \triangle GMN \), with \( \triangle GMN \) being similar to \( \triangle AMN \) and having a similarity ratio of \( 1:2 \) (since \( G \) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio).

Therefore, the area of \( \triangle GMN \) is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \) of the area of \( \triangle AMN \). The area of \( \triangle ENG \) is the remaining part of \( \triangle AMN \):

"To determine the fraction of the total number of books that are mathematics books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books in all four silff.
2. Identify the number of mathematics books in the middle silff.
3. Determine the fraction of the total number of books that are mathematics books.

First, let's find the total number of books in all four silff. The number of books in each silff is given as follows:
- The first silff has 3 books.
- The second silff has 24 books.
- The third silff has 8 books.
- The fourth silff has 10 books.

Adding these together, we get:

So, the total number of books is 45.

Next, we identify the number of mathematics books in the middle silff. The middle silff is the third silff, which has 10 mathematics books.

Now, we need to determine the fraction of the total number of books that are mathematics books. This fraction is given by the number of mathematics books divided by the total number of books:
\[ \frac{10}{45} \]

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 45, which is 5. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
\[ \frac{10 \div 5}{45 \div 5} = \frac{2}{9} \]

"To find the fourth term in the arithmetic sequence where the second term is \(200\) and the fifth term is \(500\), we need to determine the common difference \(d\) and then use it to find the fourth term.

First, let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence by \(a\). The general form of the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]

We know the second term \(a_2 = 200\), so:
\[ a + d = 200 \]

We also know the fifth term \(a_5 = 500\), so:
\[ a + 4d = 500 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a + d = 200\)
2. \(a + 4d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a + 4d) - (a + d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 3d = 300 \]
\[ d = 100 \]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a\):
\[ a + 100 = 200 \]
\[ a = 100 \]

Now that we have the first term \(a\) and the common difference \(d\), we can find the fourth term \(a_4\):
\[ a_4 = a + 3d \]
\[ a_4 = 100 + 3 \cdot 100 \]

"To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as a perfect \( n \)-th power. This means there exists an integer \( k \) such that:

\[ 2^{24} = k^n \]

Taking the \( n \)-th root of both sides, we get:

\[ k = 2^{24/n} \]

For \( k \) to be an integer, \( 24/n \) must be an integer. Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are:

\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list of divisors. The remaining divisors are:

"To determine how many nickels Hillary has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total value of the coins in cents.
2. Determine the value of the dimes.
3. Determine the value of the nickels.
4. Calculate the number of nickels.

Step 1: Identify the total value of the coins in cents.
The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

Step 2: Determine the value of the dimes.
Each dime is worth 10 cents. Since Hillary has one dime, the value of the dime is:
\[ 1 \text{ dime} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 10 \text{ cents} \]

Step 3: Determine the value of the nickels.
The value of the nickels is the total value of the coins minus the value of the dime:
\[ 75 \text{ cents} - 10 \text{ cents} = 65 \text{ cents} \]

Step 4: Calculate the number of nickels.
Each nickel is worth 5 cents. To find out how many nickels Hillary has, we divide the total value of the nickels by the value of one nickel:

"To find the least positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all 0s and 1s, we start by considering the prime factorization of 450. We have:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 3^2, and 5^2. This means the number must end in 00 (to be divisible by 5^2) and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 (to be divisible by 3^2).

Since the number must consist only of the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits will be the number of 1s in the number. Therefore, the number must contain at least 9 ones.

Let's construct the smallest number that meets these criteria. The number must end in 00 and contain at least 9 ones. The smallest such number is:

\[ 11111111100 \]

Let's verify that this number is divisible by 450:

- The sum of its digits is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3^2.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the flag will be placed on a specific square of the grid. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Understanding the Grid and the Flag Placement:**
   - The grid is a 4x5 grid, which means there are 20 squares in total.
   - The flag is placed on a specific square, and we need to find the probability that this specific square is chosen.

2. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - Since the flag can be placed on any of the 20 squares with equal probability, the probability that the flag is placed on a specific square is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so the expression becomes:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \sin^2 80^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 10^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ \cdot 4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 10^\circ = 3 \sin^4 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]

We can use the double-angle identity \(\cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ - 1\) and \(\cos^2 10^\circ = \frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). Applying this identity, we can pair the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, consider the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the cosecant function:
\[

Using this identity, we can rewrite the second and third terms of the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.

Now, substitute these rewritten forms back into the original expression:

Rearranging this congruence, we get:

This implies that \( t \) must be a divisor of 2 modulo 23. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. Since \( t \) must be greater than 0 and less than 23, we need to check which of these values satisfy the original condition.

"To find the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers starting from 1, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. The sequence of odd numbers is:

\[1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\]

This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

For our sequence, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2\]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we have:

\[a_n = 1 + 2(n-1) = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1\]

So, the \(n\)-th term of the sequence is \(2n - 1\). To find the 2003rd term, we substitute \(n = 2003\) into the formula:

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find the value of \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the value of \( f(5) \).
3. Find the value of \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
To find \( f(5) \), we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from the value of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Next, we proceed to step 3. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
To find \( g(6) \), we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse tangent and inverse cotangent functions. Specifically, for any non-zero \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

However, in our problem, we have \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) instead of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the expression inside the sine function becomes

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x).
\]

So the equation simplifies to

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

So the equation becomes

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply to get

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). Substituting these values in, we get

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), respectively. Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{d}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 31 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 6 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 58 = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

\[
d = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie within the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to count all the integer points \((x,y)\) such that \(-5 < x < 5\) and \(-4 < y < 4\).

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

Next, we use the property of the cross product that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Adding these vectors together, we get:

"To find the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \), we start by analyzing the given information about quadrilateral \( ABCD \). We know that \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \), \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), and \( \overline{AC} \) is the altitude from vertex \( A \) to side \( CD \) in \( \triangle ACD \). The area of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is given as 42.

Since \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \), quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
\]
where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \( h \) is the height. In this case, \( b_1 = AD \), \( b_2 = BC \), and \( h = AC \). Therefore, the area of trapezoid \( ABCD \) can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times AC
\]
We know that \( [ABCD] = 42 \), so:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times AC
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
84 = (AD + BC) \times AC
\]

Now, we need to find the area of \( \triangle ACD \). The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
For \( \triangle ACD \), the base is \( CD \) and the height is \( AC \). Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC
\]

To find \( CD \), we note that \( CD \) is part of the expression \( AD + BC \). However, we do not need the exact values of \( AD \) and \( BC \) to find the area of \( \triangle ACD \). We can use the fact that the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half the area of the trapezoid if we consider the height \( AC \) and the base \( CD \) in the context of the trapezoid's area formula.

Since \( \overline{AC} \) is the height for both the trapezoid and the triangle, and \( CD \) is part of the base sum \( AD + BC \), we can use the relationship between the areas directly. The area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half the area of the trapezoid if we consider the height \( AC \) and the base \( CD \) in the context of the trapezoid's area formula.

Thus, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:

[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:

   There are 4 points, and we need to pair them into two segments. The number of ways to pair 4 points is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form one segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the other segment. This can be calculated as:

Now, substitute \(\sin A\), \(\sin B\), \(\cos A\), and \(\cos B\) into the formulas for \(\sin (A + B)\) and \(\sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin A = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}

Now, multiply \(\sin (A + B)\) and \(\sin (B - A)\):

"To determine the probability that the beagle will be in the middle of the line after 20 troedfedd, we need to consider the possible positions of the beagle after each troedfedd. The beagle can move to the left or to the right, and we need to find the probability that after 20 moves, the beagle is in the middle position.

Let's denote the positions of the beagle as follows:
- The leftmost position is position 0.
- The rightmost position is position 20.
- The middle position is position 10.

The beagle starts at position 10. After each troedfedd, the beagle can move to position 9 or position 11. We need to find the probability that after 20 troedfedd, the beagle is back at position 10.

This problem can be solved using the binomial distribution. The beagle needs to make an equal number of moves to the left and to the right to return to the middle position. If the beagle makes \( k \) moves to the left, then it must make \( 20 - k \) moves to the right. For the beagle to be back at position 10, \( k \) must be equal to \( 10 \). Therefore, the beagle must make exactly 10 moves to the left and 10 moves to the right.

The number of ways to arrange 10 moves to the left and 10 moves to the right in 20 moves is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{20}{10} \). The probability of each specific sequence of 10 moves to the left and 10 moves to the right is \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20} \).

Therefore, the probability that the beagle will be in the middle of the line after 20 troedfedd is:
\[
\binom{20}{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20}
\]

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient \( \binom{20}{10} \):
\[
\binom{20}{10} = \frac{20!}{10!10!} = 184756
\]

Next, we calculate \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20} \):
\[
\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20} = \frac{1}{1048576}
\]

Now, we multiply these two values together:
\[
\binom{20}{10} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20} = 184756 \times \frac{1}{1048576} = \frac{184756}{1048576} = \frac{46189}{262144}

Thus, the probability that the beagle will be in the middle of the line after 20 troedfedd is:

   - Labor: 6

2. **Calculate the total number of ways to form an is-bwyllgor of 5 aelod without any restrictions:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 aelod from 14 (8 + 6) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):

"To solve the problem, we need to find three consecutive integers whose sum is 120 and whose average is 24. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( x \), \( x+1 \), and \( x+2 \).

First, we know that the sum of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x + 3 = 120 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 117 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 39 \]

So, the three consecutive integers are \( x = 39 \), \( x+1 = 40 \), and \( x+2 = 41 \).

To verify, we check the sum of these integers:
\[ 39 + 40 + 41 = 120 \]

We also check the average of these integers:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{39 + 40 + 41}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation is:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x-2 = \pm 64

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x-2 = 64\)
2. \(x-2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62

"To solve for the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(AB = AC\), so triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles.
   - \(AM = 11\), where \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\).
   - \(AD = 10\), so \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).
   - \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

2. **Define the angles:**
   - Let \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3 \times 2\theta = 6\theta\).

3. **Use the properties of the circle:**
   - Points \(B\), \(D\), and \(C\) lie on a circle with \(BC\) as the chord and \(D\) on the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\).
   - The measure of the central angle subtended by arc \(BC\) is \(2 \times 2\theta = 4\theta\).
   - The measure of the inscribed angle \(\angle BDC\) is half of the central angle, so \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\).

4. **Relate the angles:**
   - Since \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\) and \(\angle BDC\) is also the external angle to \(\triangle ABD\) at \(D\), it is equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles:
     \[
     \angle BDC = \angle BAD + \angle ABD = \theta + (90^\circ - \theta) = 90^\circ.
     \]
   - Therefore, \(6\theta = 90^\circ\), so \(\theta = 15^\circ\).

5. **Determine the angles of the triangle:**
   - \(\angle BAC = 2\theta = 30^\circ\).
   - \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 75^\circ\).

6. **Use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle ABC\):**
   - In \(\triangle ABC\), \(BC = 2BM = 2 \times 11 \sin 75^\circ = 22 \sin 75^\circ\).
   - Using the Law of Sines:
     \[
     \frac{AB}{\sin 75^\circ} = \frac{BC}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{22 \sin 75^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = 44 \sin 75^\circ.
     \]
   - Therefore, \(AB = 44 \sin 75^\circ \sin 75^\circ = 44 \sin^2 75^\circ\).

7. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
     \[
     AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \times 44 \sin^2 75^\circ + 22 \sin 75^\circ = 88 \sin^2 75^\circ + 22 \sin 75^\circ.
     \]
   - Using the identity \(\sin 75^\circ = \sin (45^\circ + 30^\circ) = \sin 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ + \cos 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}\):
     \[
     \sin^2 75^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{12} + 2}{16} = \frac{8 + 4\sqrt{3}}{16} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{4}.

   - Therefore, the perimeter is:

"To find the median of 27 positive integers whose product is \(3^7\), we need to consider the properties of the median and the given product. The median of a set of 27 integers is the 14th smallest integer in the ordered list of these integers.

Since the product of the integers is \(3^7\), each integer in the set must be a power of 3. The possible integers are \(3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4, 3^5, 3^6,\) and \(3^7\). However, \(3^0 = 1\) and \(3^7 = 2187\) are not feasible because they would make it impossible to have 27 integers whose product is \(3^7\) (since \(1\) would not contribute to the product and \(2187\) would be too large).

Therefore, the integers must be \(3^1, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4, 3^5,\) and \(3^6\). To find a combination of these integers that multiply to \(3^7\), we need to use the fact that the sum of the exponents must be 7. We can use the integer 1 (which is \(3^0\)) to help balance the product.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two parts: solving \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) and solving \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

### Step 1: Solve \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \]

Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), the smallest value \(x^4 + 4x^2\) can take is 0 (when \(x = 0\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\). This means that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \]

To solve this, we can use a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). We can do this using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]

This gives us two roots:
\[ y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7 \]

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola that opens upwards (since the coefficient of \(y^2\) is positive). Therefore, the quadratic is less than 0 between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). So, we have:
\[ -7 < y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\). Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the part of the solution where \(y < 0\). Therefore, we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this equation as:
\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.\]
We can also express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the identity, we get:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also know that:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12.\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we substitute to get:
\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[sp = 24.\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(sp = 24\).

From the second equation, we solve for \(p\):
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}) = s^3 - 72.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which simplifies to
\[s^3 = 64.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[s = 4.\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]

"To determine the number of students who received an A grade in each grade level, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of students who received a grade other than A (i.e., the sum of the percentages of students who received grades B, C, D, and F).

First, let's find the percentage of students who received grades other than A for each grade level:
- For the 9th grade: \(100\% - 41.1\% = 58.9\%\)
- For the 10th grade: \(100\% - 34.4\% = 65.6\%\)

Next, we calculate \(135\%\) of the number of students who received grades other than A for each grade level:
- For the 9th grade: \(135\% \times 58.9\% = 1.35 \times 58.9 = 79.665\%\)
- For the 10th grade: \(135\% \times 65.6\% = 1.35 \times 65.6 = 88.68\%\)
- For the 11th grade: \(135\% \times 79.4\% = 1.35 \times 79.4 = 107.29\%\)
- For the 12th grade: \(135\% \times 88.4\% = 1.35 \times 88.4 = 119.82\%\)

Since the percentage of students who received an A grade cannot exceed 100%, we cap the values at 100%:
- For the 9th grade: \(79.665\% \approx 79.67\%\)
- For the 10th grade: \(88.68\% \approx 88.68\%\)
- For the 11th grade: \(107.29\% \approx 100\%\)
- For the 12th grade: \(119.82\% \approx 100\%\)

- For the 11th grade: \(100\% \times 300 = 1 \times 300 = 300\)
- For the 12th grade: \(100\% \times 300 = 1 \times 300 = 300\)

Finally, we sum the number of students who received an A grade in all grade levels:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]

The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which can be factored as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and not zero (since the inequality is strict).

Next, we need to determine where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\). Then \(x(x-36) = 1(1-36) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also ensure that the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is not zero, which means \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \((0, 36)\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Thus, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.

"To find the maximum possible area of the cauldron, we need to analyze the given shape, which consists of a rectangle with two semicircles at the ends. The total length of the trac is 400 meters, which includes the length of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) meters and the width of the rectangle (which is also the diameter of each semicircle) by \( W \) meters. The circumference of one semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle with diameter \( W \), which is \( \frac{\pi W}{2} \). Since there are two semicircles, the total circumference of the semicircles is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the trac is the sum of the length of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles:
\[ L + \pi W = 400. \]

We want to maximize the area of the cauldron, which is the area of the rectangle plus the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \) and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \). Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is \( \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \).

Therefore, the total area \( A \) of the cauldron is:
\[ A = L \times W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4}. \]

We can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) using the equation \( L + \pi W = 400 \):
\[ L = 400 - \pi W. \]

Substituting this into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = (400 - \pi W) W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 400W - \pi W^2 + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 400W - \frac{3\pi W^2}{4}. \]

To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 400 - \frac{3\pi W}{2} = 0. \]

Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[ \frac{3\pi W}{2} = 400 \implies W = \frac{800}{3\pi}. \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{800}{3\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = 400 - \pi \left( \frac{800}{3\pi} \right) = 400 - \frac{800}{3} = \frac{1200}{3} - \frac{800}{3} = \frac{400}{3}. \]

Finally, we calculate the maximum area \( A \):
\[ A = \left( \frac{400}{3} \right) \left( \frac{800}{3\pi} \right) + \frac{\pi \left( \frac{800}{3\pi} \right)^2}{4} = \frac{320000}{9\pi} + \frac{\pi \left( \frac{640000}{9\pi^2} \right)}{4} = \frac{320000}{9\pi} + \frac{640000}{36\pi} = \frac{320000}{9\pi} + \frac{160000}{9\pi} = \frac{480000}{9\pi} = \frac{160000}{3\pi}. \]

Thus, the maximum possible area of the cauldron is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\):**
   Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2.

2. **Determine the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):**
   Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
   \[
   x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   x^2 + 4 = 25

   \[
   x^2 = 21

   \[
   x = \sqrt{21}

   So, the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) is \(\sqrt{21}\).

3. **Determine \(\sin{T}\):**
   In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side to that angle divided by the hypotenuse. For angle \(T\), the opposite side is the adjacent side to angle \(R\), which is \(\sqrt{21}\), and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, we have:

"To find the distance between the vertex of the parabola \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) and the point on the graph, we first need to identify the vertex of the parabola. The given equation is in the form \( y = a(x^2 + bx + c) \), where \( a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = -3 \).

The vertex form of a parabola \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \) gives us the vertex at \( (h, k) \). For the given equation, we can rewrite it as:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x - 0)^2 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Thus, the vertex is at \( (0, -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}) \). Rationalizing the y-coordinate, we get:
\[ -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}. \]
So, the vertex is at \( (0, -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}) \).

Next, we need to find the distance between the vertex \( (0, -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}) \) and a point on the graph. Let's consider the point \( (x, y) \) on the graph. The distance \( d \) between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by the distance formula:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}. \]
Substituting the coordinates of the vertex and the point on the graph, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + \left(y - \left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(y + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2}. \]
Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \( y \) in the distance formula:
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2}. \]
Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{x^2 - 3}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2(x^2 - 3) + 3\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2x^2 - 6 + 6}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2x^2}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{x^2 \sqrt{2}}{2}. \]
So, the distance formula becomes:
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{x^2 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{2x^4}{4}} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{x^4}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2x^2 + x^4}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{x^2(2 + x^2)}{2}} = \frac{x \sqrt{2 + x^2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{x \sqrt{2 + x^2} \sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{x \sqrt{4 + 2x^2}}{2}. \]
To find the minimum distance, we need to consider the vertex itself, which is the point where the distance is zero. However, if we consider the point on the graph where \( x = 1 \):
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-2) = -\sqrt{2}. \]
The distance between the vertex \( (0, -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}) \) and the point \( (1, -\sqrt{2}) \) is:
\[ d = \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + \left(-\sqrt{2} - \left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(-\sqrt{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{-2\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}. \]
Thus, the distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \), which is in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) where \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 6 + 2 = 8 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us two factors: \( x = 0 \) and \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) are not solutions. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution. Testing other possible rational roots or using numerical methods would show that there are no other real roots greater than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the center of the octahedron, we start by understanding the geometric properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron can be visualized as two pyramids with a square base joined at their bases. The center of the octahedron is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the centers of the two pyramids.

Given that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the octahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \), where \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) form one face and \( E \) and \( F \) are the opposite vertices.

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to \( 4a^2 + 4b^2 \), where \( a \) is the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron and \( b \) is the distance from the center to a vertex.

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to the center of the octahedron as \( a \) and the distance from the center to a vertex as \( b \). The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 4a^2 + 4b^2 \]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[ 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ 7^2 = 49 \]
\[ 8^2 = 64 \]
\[ 9^2 = 81 \]
\[ 11^2 = 121 \]

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 4a^2 + 4b^2 \]

Since \( 4a^2 + 4b^2 \) is a constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices must be equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices, which is \( 6b^2 \).

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices, which is \( 6b^2 \).

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices, which is \( 6b^2 \).

S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 = 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2) = -8.
\]

Thus, the polynomial whose roots are \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) is:

\[
t^3 - 8t - 4 = 0.
\]

The roots of this polynomial are \(2, -1 + \sqrt{3}i,\) and \(-1 - \sqrt{3}i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of a single pencil, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( p \) be the cost of one pencil.
- Let \( j \) be the cost of one jumbo pencil.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The cost of three pencils and one jumbo pencil is \$1.24:
   \[
   3p + j = 1.24
   \]

2. The cost of five pencils and one jumbo pencil is \$1.82:
   \[
   5p + j = 1.82
   \]

To eliminate \( j \) from the equations, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + j) - (3p + j) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2p = 0.58
\]

To solve for \( p \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
p = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's define the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \(ABCD\):
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

Given that \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\), we have:
\[ \frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \implies a = kb \]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[ d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[ d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]

We need to find the region where \(d_O < d_A\), \(d_O < d_B\), \(d_O < d_C\), and \(d_O < d_D\).

### Step 1: Determine the region where \(d_O < d_A\)
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 2ax - 2by < a^2 - b^2 \]
\[ ax - by < \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2} \]

### Step 2: Determine the region where \(d_O < d_B\)
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \]
\[ -2ax - 2by < a^2 - b^2 \]
\[ ax + by > \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2} \]

### Step 3: Determine the region where \(d_O < d_C\)
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \]
\[ -2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \]
\[ ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

### Step 4: Determine the region where \(d_O < d_D\)
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2} \]
Squaring both sides:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \]
\[ 2ax + 2by > -a^2 - b^2 \]
\[ ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

### Step 5: Combine the regions
The region where \(d_O < d_A\), \(d_O < d_B\), \(d_O < d_C\), and \(d_O < d_D\) is the intersection of the four regions:
\[ ax - by < \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2} \]
\[ ax + by > \frac{a^2 - b^2}{2} \]
\[ ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]
\[ ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \]

This region forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 - b^2}{b}\).

### Step 6: Calculate the area of the smaller rectangle
The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \left(\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a}\right) \left(\frac{a^2 - b^2}{b}\right) = \frac{(a^2 - b^2)^2}{ab} \]

### Step 7: Calculate the area of the larger rectangle
The area of the larger rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{large}} = 4ab \]

### Step 8: Calculate the probability
The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the larger rectangle:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{large}}} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 - b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 - b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{(a^2 - b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{(k^2 - 1)^2}{4k^2} \]

Thus, the probability is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{(k^2 - 1)^2}{4k^2}} \]","[(k**2 - 1)**2/((4*k**2)), '\\frac{(k^2 - 1)^2}{4k^2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the value of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. The modulo operation can be expressed as:

\[54 \mod 6 = 54 - 6 \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor\]

First, we calculate the division of 54 by 6:

\[\frac{54}{6} = 9\]

Since 9 is a whole number, the floor function \(\left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor\) is also 9. Now, we multiply 6 by 9:

\[6 \times 9 = 54\]

Next, we subtract this product from 54:

\[54 - 54 = 0\]

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. So, the value of \(54 \mod 6\) is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately \( \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( 1.0472 < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately \( 6.7082 \).
- Since \( 6.7082 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine the total amount of money that Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie received, we need to add up the amounts each person received. The amounts are as follows:

- Linda: \$27.47
- Sherry: \$35.23
- June: \$37.37
- Connie: \$26.52

First, we add these amounts together step by step.

1. Add Linda's and Sherry's amounts:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]

2. Add June's amount to the result:
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]

3. Add Connie's amount to the result:
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

So, the total amount of money that Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie received is \$126.59.

Next, we need to convert this total amount into British pounds. Since 1 dollar is approximately 0.75 British pounds, we multiply the total amount by 0.75:
\[
126.59 \times 0.75 = 94.9425

"To find the average mark of the class, we need to calculate the total marks obtained by all the students and then divide that by the number of students.

First, let's determine the total marks obtained by the students:

- 8 students scored 90. So, the total marks for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students scored 100. So, the total marks for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these marks to get the total marks for the class:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Next, we divide the total marks by the number of students in the class, which is 30:
\[\frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

Therefore, the average mark of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) grid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the numbers in the grid:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first row
The sum of the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the second row
The sum of the second row is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2 + 2n-9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
So, \( S = 3n - 6 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the third row
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first column
The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3 + n+2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 5: Calculate the sum of the second column
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]
So, \( S = 3n - 6 \).

### Step 6: Calculate the sum of the third column
The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1 + 1 + n-1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

### Step 7: Calculate the sum of the main diagonal
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3 + 2n-9 + n-1 = 4n - 13
\]
So, \( S = 4n - 13 \).

### Step 8: Calculate the sum of the other diagonal
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1 + 2n-9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]
So, \( S = 3n - 6 \).

Since the sum \( S \) must be the same for all rows, columns, and diagonals, we can set up the following equations:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 = 4n - 13
\]

First, solve \( 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \):
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7
\]

Next, verify \( n = 7 \) in the other equation \( 2n + 1 = 4n - 13 \):
\[
2(7) + 1 = 4(7) - 13 \implies 14 + 1 = 28 - 13 \implies 15 = 15
\]
The equation holds true, so \( n = 7 \) is correct.

"To determine how many more draws Jim needs to win compared to Martha, we need to analyze the conditions under which each player wins.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of draws Jim needs to win.
- Let \( M \) be the number of draws Martha needs to win.

The total number of draws in the game is the sum of the draws by Jim and Martha, which is equal to the total number of possible outcomes minus the number of wins by Jim and Martha. Since the game is a zero-sum game, the total number of draws is the sum of the draws by Jim and Martha.

Given that the cae is 300 troedfedd of led and 400 troedfedd of hyd, the total number of draws is:
\[ J + M = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

We need to find the difference between the number of draws Jim needs to win and the number of draws Martha needs to win:
\[ J - M \]

To find this, we need to consider the conditions under which each player wins. Jim wins if he has more draws than Martha, and Martha wins if she has more draws than Jim. Since the total number of draws is fixed, the difference in the number of draws between Jim and Martha is the same as the difference in the number of wins between Jim and Martha.

Therefore, the number of more draws Jim needs to win compared to Martha is:
\[ J - M = 1 \]

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega \neq 1\) and \(\omega^2 \neq 1\). These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator. We expand it as follows:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1, and the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
