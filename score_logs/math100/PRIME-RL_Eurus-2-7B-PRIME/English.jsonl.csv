We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\angle EFD = 90^\circ$, and $\sin D = 0.7$. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can use the given value of $\sin D$ to find the length of $DF$. We know that $EF = 7$, so we can set up the equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that:
\[
DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2
\]
\[
DE^2 + 49 = 100
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given a complex number $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and another complex number $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the result $w$ when $z$ is rotated around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counter-clockwise.

To solve this, we can use the concept of complex number rotation. The rotation of a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$ can be achieved by the formula:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]
where $e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$. For a counter-clockwise rotation of $\frac{\pi}{4}$, we have $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to calculate $z - c$ first:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \]

Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) - 3 \sqrt{2} i \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = (1 + i) - 3i (1 + i) \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 \]
\[ = 1 - 2i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Finally, we add $c$ to the result to get $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

The problem requires simplifying the square root of 242. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves seating 8 people around a round table, with the constraint that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We need to account for the circular nature of the table, which means that rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.

[ADVANCE]

1. Treat the group of 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) who want to sit together as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 ""people"" (5 individual people plus the block of 3) around a round table.
2. The number of ways to arrange \(n\) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" is \((6-1)! = 5!\).
3. Within the block of 3 people, there are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.
4. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the 8 people around the round table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is \(5! \times 3!\).

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}x^{3(5-k)}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{-2k}
\]
Simplifying the exponents of \(x\), we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{3}10^{5-3}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3x^{15-5\cdot3} = \binom{5}{3}10^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3x^0
\]
Calculating the value, we have:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5\cdot4}{2} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ into the expression $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$, but it's simpler to directly substitute $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$ into the expression and simplify.

The problem involves finding the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center to coincide with its original position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides of equal length and 5 equal interior angles. When rotated about its center, the pentagon will coincide with its original position when the rotation angle is a multiple of the central angle subtended by one of its sides.

The central angle of a regular pentagon can be calculated as \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \). This is the angle by which the pentagon needs to be rotated to bring one vertex to the position of the next vertex.

To find the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to find the smallest rotation angle that is a multiple of the central angle and brings the pentagon back to its original position. Since the pentagon has 5-fold rotational symmetry, the minimum rotation angle is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \times 5 = 360^\circ \), but we can also consider the rotation by one full cycle of the symmetry, which is the same as the central angle times the number of sides, but the smallest one is the central angle itself times the number of times it repeats to get back to the original, that is 72 degrees times 5/5 or just full 360/5.

However, the question asks for the minimum degrees, so we need the smallest angle, which is the central angle itself.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is the central angle itself, which is \( 72^\circ \).

However, we need to confirm if this is indeed the minimum angle that brings the pentagon back to its original position.

Next action: [VERIFY]

We have calculated the central angle of the pentagon as \( 72^\circ \), which is the angle between two adjacent vertices. Rotating the pentagon by \( 72^\circ \) will bring one vertex to the position of the next vertex, but it will not coincide with the original position of the pentagon. To coincide with the original position, the pentagon needs to be rotated by an angle that is a multiple of the central angle and brings all vertices back to their original positions. The smallest such angle is indeed \( 360^\circ \), but we can also consider the rotational symmetry of the pentagon, which is \( 72^\circ \times 5 = 360^\circ \). However, the pentagon will coincide with its original position after a rotation of \( 72^\circ \times 5/5 = 72^\circ \) times 1 which is not the case, it will be after \( 72 \times 5/5 \) which is 360/5 =72.

However, we can also check the option of 360/5 =72.

The answer seems to be correct as the pentagon will coincide with its original position after a rotation of \( 72^\circ \).

The minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center to coincide with its original position is \( \boxed{72} \).

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram given the coordinates of the other three vertices. We can use the property of parallelograms that the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal.

The coordinates of the given vertices are $(5, 3)$, $(6, 8)$, $(7, 4)$, and $(x, y)$. We need to find the value of $x + y$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$ is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$. The midpoint formula is given by:
\[
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]
So, the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$ is:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + 7}{2}, \frac{8 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5 + x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3 + y}{2} = 6
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are $(8, 9)$. Since $x > 7$, this solution is valid.

We are given a right triangle $ABC$ with $\angle B = 90^\circ$, and we know that $\sin A = 2\cos A$. We need to find the value of $\tan A$.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the definition of sine and cosine in a right triangle to express $\sin A$ and $\cos A$ in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let's denote the side opposite to $\angle A$ as $a$, the side adjacent to $\angle A$ as $b$, and the hypotenuse as $c$. Then, we have:
\[
\sin A = \frac{a}{c} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Given that $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can substitute the expressions for sine and cosine:
\[
\frac{a}{c} = 2 \cdot \frac{b}{c}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a = 2b
\]
We need to find $\tan A$, which is defined as:
\[
\tan A = \frac{a}{b}
\]
Since we have $a = 2b$, we can substitute this into the expression for $\tan A$:
\[
\tan A = \frac{2b}{b} = 2

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the rational function $f(x)=\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$ and then summing the values of the asymptotes.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is $x^2-5x-14$. We can factor this quadratic expression to find its roots.

The quadratic expression $x^2-5x-14$ can be factored as $(x-7)(x+2)$. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes occur at $x=7$ and $x=-2$. So, we have $a=7$ and $b=-2$.

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ depends on the degrees of the polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$. So, we have $c=0$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can find the sum of the asymptotes $a+b+c$. We have $a=7$, $b=-2$, and $c=0$. Therefore, the sum is $7 + (-2) + 0 = 5$.

Since \( z^5 = 1 \), we can express 1 as \( z^5 \) in the given expression. We also know that \( z \neq 1 \), so \( z \) is a fifth root of unity other than 1.

We can use the fact that \( z^5 = 1 \) to simplify the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

The number $58_9$ in base 10 is calculated as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

We start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\), since \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). The expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

\]

We can use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) to simplify the numerator:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

The problem involves converting the weights of different objects (treeks, squigs, and goolees) into a common unit. We are given two equations relating the weights of these objects. Let's denote the weight of a treek as $T$, the weight of a squig as $S$, and the weight of a goolee as $G$.

The first equation is: $10T = 3S + G$.
The second equation is: $2T + G = S$.

We need to find the number of treeks whose combined weight equals the weight of one squig, i.e., we need to find $x$ such that $xT = S$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the second equation to express $G$ in terms of $S$ and $T$: $G = S - 2T$.

Now, substitute this expression for $G$ into the first equation: $10T = 3S + (S - 2T)$.

Simplify the equation: $10T = 4S - 2T$.

Combine like terms: $12T = 4S$.

Divide both sides by 4: $3T = S$.

This tells us that the weight of one squig is equal to the combined weight of 3 treeks. Therefore, the number of treeks whose combined weight equals the weight of one squig is 3.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem is solved, and we have found that the combined weight of 3 treeks equals the weight of one squig. Therefore, the final answer is:

The problem involves finding the values of $a$ and $b$ by comparing the product of two polynomials with a given polynomial.

[ADVANCE]

To find the product of the two polynomials $3t^2+5t+a$ and $4t^2+bt-2$, we will use the distributive property to expand the product. The product is given by:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
12t^4 + (3b+20)t^3 + (5b-6+4a)t^2 + (ab-10)t - 2a
\]
We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can set up the following equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
5b - 6 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
ab - 10 = -16
\]
\[
-2a = 6
\]

[ADVANCE]

From the equation $-2a = 6$, we can solve for $a$:
\[
a = -3
\]
Substituting $a = -3$ into the equation $ab - 10 = -16$, we get:
\[
-3b - 10 = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]
We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by substituting them into the other equations. Substituting $b = 2$ into the equation $3b + 20 = 26$, we get:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]
This equation holds true. Finally, substituting $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into the equation $5b - 6 + 4a = -8$, we get:
\[
5(2) - 6 + 4(-3) = 10 - 6 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation also holds true.

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have verified the values of $a$ and $b$, we can find the sum $a + b$:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

The problem involves finding the radius of a right cylindrical tank based on the rate at which it is being filled with water and the rate at which the water level is rising.

[ADVANCE]
The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the rate at which the water level is rising is 4 meters per hour. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height.

Since the radius of the cylinder is constant, we can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\) to get:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
We are given \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
We can simplify this equation to solve for \(r\).

[ADVANCE]
Dividing both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\), we get:
\[
r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]
Since the radius cannot be negative, we take the positive square root.

The radius of the tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.

The problem involves finding the largest value of $a$ such that the graph of the piecewise function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once. This means that for any horizontal line $y = k$, there must be at least one $x$ such that $f(x) = k$.

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function for both $x \geq a$ and $x < a$. For $x \geq a$, the function is $f(x) = ax^2$, and for $x < a$, the function is $f(x) = ax + 2a$.

We need to find the range of each part of the piecewise function. For $x \geq a$, the function $f(x) = ax^2$ is a quadratic function that opens upwards (assuming $a > 0$), so the minimum value of $f(x)$ for $x \geq a$ occurs at $x = a$, which is $f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3$.

For $x < a$, the function $f(x) = ax + 2a$ is a linear function, and its value at $x = a$ is $f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$. As $x$ approaches negative infinity, the value of $f(x)$ also approaches negative infinity.

To ensure that the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once, the range of the quadratic part $f(x) = ax^2$ for $x \geq a$ must overlap with the range of the linear part $f(x) = ax + 2a$ for $x < a$. This means that the minimum value of the quadratic part, $a^3$, must be less than or equal to the value of the linear part at $x = a$, which is $a^2 + 2a$.

[ADVANCE]

We need to solve the inequality $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$ to find the largest value of $a$. Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out $a$, we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
We need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true. The roots of the equation are $a = 0$, $a = 2$, and $a = -1$. We can use these roots to define the intervals to test the inequality.

Testing the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(2, \infty)$, we find that the inequality $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$ holds true for $a \in [-1, 0] \cup [2, \infty)$. However, since we are looking for the largest value of $a$ and considering the context of the problem (where $a$ is a coefficient that determines the shape of the function), we take the largest value from the interval $[0, 2]$.

Therefore, the largest value of $a$ is $\boxed{2}$.

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the given circle equation represents a circle with a radius of length 1. The equation of the circle is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]
To find the value of \( c \), we need to rewrite the circle equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms in the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \).

For the \( x \) terms: \( x^2 - 10x \) can be written as \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).
For the \( y \) terms: \( y^2 + 6y \) can be written as \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).

So, the equation becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we have \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we can set \( 34 - c = 1 \) and solve for \( c \).

[ADVANCE]
Now, we solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

So, the value of \( c \) is \( \boxed{33} \).

We need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which there exists an $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x.$ The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$, and we are given that $0 \le \lambda \le 4.$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition, we need to compute $f(f(x))$ and set it equal to $x$. First, let's calculate $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
We want $f(f(x)) = x$, so we set the expression equal to $x$:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This equation must have a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$. Let's simplify the equation:
\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
We can factor out $x$ from both sides of the equation:
\[x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two cases: $x = 0$ or $\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0$. If $x = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$, which means $f(x) = x$, so we are not interested in this solution. Therefore, we consider the second case:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.\]
We need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which this equation has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To proceed, let's consider the case when $x = 1$. Substituting $x = 1$ into the equation $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$, we get:
\[f(1) = \lambda \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0.\]
So, $f(1) = 0 \neq 1$, which means $x = 1$ is not a solution to $f(x) = x$. Now, let's substitute $x = 1$ into the equation $\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0$:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda \cdot 1 + \lambda \cdot 1^2) - 1 = -1 \neq 0.\]
This means $x = 1$ is not a solution to the equation $\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0$. Next, we need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which the equation $\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$.

Let's consider the fixed points of the function $f(x)$. The fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(x) = x$:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ or $\lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0$. If $x = 0$, then it is a fixed point. For the second solution, we have:
\[\lambda x = \lambda - 1 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.\]
For $x$ to be in the interval $[0,1]$, we need $0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1$. Since $\lambda > 0$, we can multiply the inequality by $\lambda$:
\[0 \le \lambda - 1 \le \lambda \implies 1 \le \lambda.\]
So, the fixed points of the function $f(x)$ are $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$ for $\lambda \ge 1$.

Next, we need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which $f(f(x)) = x$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$. We will consider the case when $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 3$ to see if they satisfy the condition.

For $\lambda = 2$, the function $f(x) = 2x(1 - x)$. We need to check if $f(f(x)) = x$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(2x(1 - x)) = 2(2x(1 - x))(1 - 2x(1 - x)) = 4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).\]
We set $f(f(x)) = x$:
\[4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = x.\]
Factoring out $x$, we get:
\[x(4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ or $4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) - 1 = 0$. We already know that $x = 0$ is a fixed point, so we consider the second solution:
\[4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) - 1 = 0.\]
We can solve this equation to find the values of $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To solve the equation $4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) - 1 = 0$, we expand the left-hand side:
\[4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 4(1 - 2x + 2x^2 - x + 2x^2 - 2x^3) = 4(1 - 3x + 4x^2 - 2x^3) = 4 - 12x + 16x^2 - 8x^3.\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[4 - 12x + 16x^2 - 8x^3 - 1 = 0 \implies -8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0.\]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation. By inspection, we find that $x = \frac{1}{2}$ is a root:
\[-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -1 + 4 - 6 + 3 = 0.\]
So, $x = \frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to the equation. We also need to check if $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \neq \frac{1}{2}$:
\[f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.\]
This means that $x = \frac{1}{2}$ is a fixed point, so $\lambda = 2$ does not satisfy the condition.

Next, we consider $\lambda = 3$. The function $f(x) = 3x(1 - x)$. We need to check if $f(f(x)) = x$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(3x(1 - x)) = 3(3x(1 - x))(1 - 3x(1 - x)) = 9x(1 - x)(1 - 3x + 3x^2).\]
We set $f(f(x)) = x$:
\[9x(1 - x)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) = x.\]
Factoring out $x$, we get:
\[x(9(1 - x)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ or $9(1 - x)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) - 1 = 0$. We already know that $x = 0$ is a fixed point, so we consider the second solution:
\[9(1 - x)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) - 1 = 0.\]
We can solve this equation to find the values of $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To solve the equation $9(1 - x)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) - 1 = 0$, we expand the left-hand side:
\[9(1 - x)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) = 9(1 - 3x + 3x^2 - x + 3x^2 - 3x^3) = 9(1 - 4x + 6x^2 - 3x^3) = 9 - 36x + 54x^2 - 27x^3.\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[9 - 36x + 54x^2 - 27x^3 - 1 = 0 \implies -27x^3 + 54x^2 - 36x + 8 = 0.\]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation. By inspection, we find that $x = \frac{2}{3}$ is a root:
\[-27\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 + 54\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 36\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 8 = -8 + 24 - 24 + 8 = 0.\]
So, $x = \frac{2}{3}$ is a solution to the equation. We also need to check if $f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \neq \frac{2}{3}$:
\[f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}.\]
This means that $x = \frac{2}{3}$ is a fixed point, so $\lambda = 3$ does not satisfy the condition.

Next, we consider $\lambda = 4$. The function $f(x) = 4x(1 - x)$. We need to check if $f(f(x)) = x$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(4x(1 - x)) = 4(4x(1 - x))(1 - 4x(1 - x)) = 16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2).\]
We set $f(f(x)) = x$:
\[16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = x.\]
Factoring out $x$, we get:
\[x(16(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ or $16(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) - 1 = 0$. We already know that $x = 0$ is a fixed point, so we consider the second solution:
\[16(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) - 1 = 0.\]
We can solve this equation to find the values of $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To solve the equation $16(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) - 1 = 0$, we expand the left-hand side:
\[16(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 16(1 - 4x + 4x^2 - x + 4x^2 - 4x^3) = 16(1 - 5x + 8x^2 - 4x^3) = 16 - 80x + 128x^2 - 64x^3.\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[16 - 80x + 128x^2 - 64x^3 - 1 = 0 \implies -64x^3 + 128x^2 - 80x + 15 = 0.\]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation. By inspection, we find that $x = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a root, and we need to check other possible roots. However, we can use the fact that $\lambda = 4$ is the upper bound of the given range, and we can check if there are any other values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition.

We have checked the values of $\lambda$ that we can easily inspect, and we found that $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 3$ do not satisfy the condition. We need to consider the possibility that there are other values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition.

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the expression. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.\]

Similarly, the denominator can be rewritten using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B).\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[\sin (5^\circ - 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ - 50^\circ) = \sin (-15^\circ) - \sin (-15^\circ) = -\sin 15^\circ + \sin 15^\circ = 0 + 0 = 0.\]
However, this simplification seems incorrect as it leads to a division by zero. Let's re-evaluate the expression by using product-to-sum identities or other trigonometric identities.

We can use the product-to-sum identities:
\[\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A + B) + \cos (A - B)],\]
\[\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) - \cos (A + B)],\]
\[\sin A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin (A + B) + \sin (A - B)],\]
\[\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin (A + B) - \sin (A - B)].\]

Applying these identities to the given expression, we get:
\[\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ],\]
\[\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ],\]
\[\sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ],\]
\[\sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ],\]
\[\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ],\]
\[\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ],\]
\[\cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ],\]
\[\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ].\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[\tan \theta = \frac{\frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] + \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ]}{\frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ] + \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ]}.\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator, we get:
\[\tan \theta = \frac{\frac{1}{2} [2\cos 25^\circ + 2\cos 85^\circ]}{\frac{1}{2} [2\sin 25^\circ - 2\sin 85^\circ]} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.\]

Using the sum-to-product identities:
\[\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),\]
\[\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).\]

We can rewrite the numerator and denominator as:
\[\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ,\]

The problem asks for the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE. The word ELLIPSE has 7 letters: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. There are repeated letters, specifically 2 L's and 2 E's.

[ADVANCE]

To find the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ELLIPSE, we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset. The formula is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \(n\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

For the word ELLIPSE, we have:
- Total number of letters, \(n = 7\)
- Frequency of L, \(n_1 = 2\)
- Frequency of E, \(n_2 = 2\)
- Frequencies of I, P, and S are all 1

So, the number of distinct arrangements is:

\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we calculate the value:

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]
\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]
\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]
\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{5040}{2 \times 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ELLIPSE is \(\boxed{1260}\).

The problem asks for the number of trailing zeroes in $42!$. To determine this, we need to find the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since $10 = 2 \times 5$, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, we need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To count the number of times 5 is a factor in $42!$, we can use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$, which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For our problem, $n = 42$ and $p = 5$. We will calculate each term in the formula:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since the next terms in the series will be zero, we can stop here. The highest power of 5 in $42!$ is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \). We need to identify the key elements, constraints, and the objective. The function involves square roots, which suggests that we might need to use inequalities or trigonometric substitutions to simplify it.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we can use a trigonometric substitution. Let's set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Using the substitution, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

We recognize that \( \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta \) is the sine addition formula, which simplifies to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Next action: [VERIFY]

[VERIFY]

We have found that the maximum value of \( f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). We need to verify that this corresponds to the maximum value of the original function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

When \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \), we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \) as a specific example. This gives us \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Substituting these values into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

This confirms that the maximum value of the function is indeed 1.

To find the area of triangle $OAB$, we need to calculate the cross product of vectors $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$. The cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:

\]
Given $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, we can calculate the cross product:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) - (3)(-2) \\ (3)(-3) - (1)(1) \\ (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ -9 - 1 \\ -2 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The magnitude of the cross product is:
\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of triangle $OAB$ is half the magnitude of the cross product:

We are given a complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = a \), where \( a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We recognize that \( a \) is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation \( a^2 = a + 1 \).

We can use the recurrence relation for powers of \( z + \frac{1}{z} \):
\[ \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 = z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \implies z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 - 2. \]
Since \( a^2 = a + 1 \), we have:
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a + 1 - 2 = a - 1. \]

We can continue this process to find higher powers:
\[ \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 = z^4 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^4} \implies z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 - 2 = (a - 1)^2 - 2 = a^2 - 2a + 1 - 2 = a - 2a = -a + 1. \]

We observe a pattern and hypothesize that \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) can be expressed in terms of \( a \). Specifically, we can use the recurrence relation:
\[ z^{n+1} + \frac{1}{z^{n+1}} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \right) - \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right). \]

Using this relation, we can calculate a few more terms to identify a pattern:
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) - \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) = a(a - 1) - a = a^2 - 2a = a + 1 - 2a = -a + 1. \]
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) - \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = a(-a + 1) - (a - 1) = -a^2 + a - a + 1 = -a^2 + 1 = -(a + 1) + 1 = -a. \]
\[ z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) - \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) = a(-a) - (-a + 1) = -a^2 + a - 1 = -(a + 1) + a - 1 = -2. \]
\[ z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) - \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) = a(-2) - (-a) = -2a + a = -a. \]
\[ z^7 + \frac{1}{z^7} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \right) - \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) = a(-a) - (-2) = -a^2 + 2 = -(a + 1) + 2 = -a + 1. \]
\[ z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^7 + \frac{1}{z^7} \right) - \left( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \right) = a(-a + 1) - (-a) = -a^2 + a + a = -a^2 + 2a = -(a + 1) + 2a = a - 1. \]

We observe that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) is periodic with a period of 12. Therefore, we can reduce the exponent 85 modulo 12:
\[ 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}. \]
Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. The line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ at $M$ and $N$, respectively. This means that $\triangle AMN$ is similar to $\triangle ABC$ by the AA similarity postulate, and the ratio of the corresponding sides of $\triangle AMN$ to $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, since $M$ and $N$ are $\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from $A$ to $B$ and $A$ to $C$, respectively.

Since the area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its side length, the area of $\triangle AMN$ is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}$ of the area of $\triangle ABC$. Therefore, the area of $\triangle AMN$ is $\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64$.

Next, we need to find the area of $\triangle ENG$. Since $G$ is the centroid, it divides $\triangle AMN$ into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of $\triangle ENG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of $\triangle AMN$.

The area of $\triangle ENG$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times 64 = \frac{64}{3}$.

We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to set up two equations based on the given information:
1. $a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200$
2. $a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500$

We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $a_1$ and solve for $d$:
$(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200$
$4d = 300$
$d = 75$

Now that we have the common difference $d$, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for $a_1$. We'll use the first equation:
$a_1 + 3d = 200$
$a_1 + 3(75) = 200$
$a_1 + 225 = 200$
$a_1 = -25$

$a_6 = a_1 + 5d$
$a_6 = -25 + 5(75)$
$a_6 = -25 + 375$

[ADVANCE]

The denominator $2^2 \cdot 5^7$ can be rewritten as $2^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 5^5 = 10^2 \cdot 5^5$. To make the denominator a power of 10, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $2^5$ to get $10^7$ in the denominator.

[ADVANCE]

To get an even sum, both numbers chosen must be either odd or even. Since there is only one even prime (2) among the first six primes, the only way to get an even sum is if both Paul and Jesse choose the number 2, or if both choose an odd prime.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that Paul chooses 2 is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability that Jesse chooses 2 is also $\frac{1}{6}$. So, the probability that both choose 2 is $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$.

The probability that Paul chooses an odd prime is $\frac{5}{6}$, and the probability that Jesse chooses an odd prime is also $\frac{5}{6}$. So, the probability that both choose an odd prime is $\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}$.

The total probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events: both choosing 2 and both choosing an odd prime. Therefore, the total probability is $\frac{1}{36} + \frac{25}{36} = \frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}$.

The problem involves finding the total area of the shaded region in a rectangle formed by twelve 1 by 1 squares. The shaded region consists of two triangles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the area of each triangle separately and then sum them up. The first triangle has a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. So, the area of the first triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4$ square units.

The second triangle has a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units. Using the same formula, the area of the second triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6$ square units.

Next, we sum the areas of the two triangles to find the total area of the shaded region: $4 + 6 = 10$ square units.

The problem requires finding the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones. To approach this, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 450. Since $450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2$, the number must be divisible by $2$, $9$, and $25$ to be a multiple of $450$.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00, as it is the only combination of zeroes and ones that is divisible by 25.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of the digits must be a sum of ones that is divisible by 9.

Given these conditions, the smallest number that meets these criteria is 11100, but we need to verify if it is indeed divisible by 450.

[VERIFY]

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2.
2. **Check divisibility by 25**: 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
3. **Check divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of 11100 is $1+1+1+0+0 = 3$, which is not divisible by 9. Therefore, 11100 is not a valid solution.

We need to find the next smallest number that meets the criteria. The next possible number is 11111100, but we need to check if it is divisible by 9.

The sum of the digits of 11111100 is $1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 6$, which is not divisible by 9. We need to continue searching for the smallest number.

The next possible number is 11111111100, let's check if it is divisible by 9.

The sum of the digits of 11111111100 is $1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9$, which is divisible by 9.

Since 11111111100 meets all the criteria (divisibility by 2, 25, and 9), it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones.

The problem involves a wheel with numbers 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, and the pointer is spun twice. The first number is divided by 4, determining the column of the checkerboard, and the second number is divided by 5, determining the row of the checkerboard. We need to find the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The first number can be divided by 4 to get the remainders 1, 2, or 3, which correspond to the columns of the checkerboard. We need to determine the possible remainders when the numbers on the wheel are divided by 4:
- 1 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1.
- 3 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3.
- 6 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 2.
- 7 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3.
- 9 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1.
So, the possible remainders for the column are 1, 2, and 3, each with a probability of $\frac{2}{5}$, $\frac{1}{5}$, and $\frac{2}{5}$ respectively.

The second number can be divided by 5 to get the remainders 1, 2, 3, or 4, which correspond to the rows of the checkerboard. We need to determine the possible remainders when the numbers on the wheel are divided by 5:
- 1 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1.
- 3 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 3.
- 6 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1.
- 7 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 2.
- 9 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4.
So, the possible remainders for the row are 1, 2, 3, and 4, each with a probability of $\frac{2}{5}$, $\frac{1}{5}$, $\frac{1}{5}$, and $\frac{1}{5}$ respectively.

Next, we need to determine the shaded squares on the checkerboard. The shaded squares are at positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3).

We need to calculate the probability of the checker being placed on each of the shaded squares. The probability of the checker being placed on a specific square is the product of the probabilities of the corresponding column and row remainders.

- For square (1,1): The probability is $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{25}$.
- For square (1,3): The probability is $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{25}$.
- For square (2,2): The probability is $\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{25}$.
- For square (2,4): The probability is $\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{25}$.
- For square (3,1): The probability is $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{25}$.
- For square (3,3): The probability is $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{25}$.

The total probability of the checker being placed on a shaded square is the sum of the probabilities of each shaded square:
\[
\frac{4}{25} + \frac{2}{25} + \frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{25} + \frac{4}{25} + \frac{2}{25} = \frac{14}{25}.

The problem requires finding the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7\cdot2^8}$. To solve this, we need to convert the fraction into its decimal form by making the denominator a power of 10.

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to calculate the value of the denominator $5^7 \cdot 2^8$. We can simplify the fraction by making the denominator a power of 10. Since $10 = 2 \cdot 5$, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $5^0$ (which is 1) to make the denominator $10^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2^1 = 10^7 \cdot 2^1 = 2^8 \cdot 5^7$.

The fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321 \cdot 2^0}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2^7} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 128} = \frac{4321}{1280000000}
\]

Now, we can convert this fraction into a decimal by performing the division.

[ADVANCE]

Performing the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{1280000000} = 0.000003384375
\]

The decimal representation of the fraction is $0.000003384375$. We need to find the sum of the digits in this decimal representation.

[ADVANCE]

The decimal representation is $0.000003384375$. We can ignore the leading zeros and focus on the non-zero digits: $3+3+8+4+3+7+5$.

Now, we calculate the sum of these digits:
\[
3 + 3 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 5 = 33
\]

So, the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7\cdot2^8}$ is $\boxed{33}$.

The problem requires finding the product of sines of several angles. We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to pair up the terms in the product. Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ) = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sin 2x}{\sin x}$ to express the product in terms of $\sin 2x$. However, a more efficient approach is to use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
We can apply this identity to the product by grouping the terms appropriately. Notice that:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 180^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 0 = 0.
\]
However, this approach seems to be leading to a complicated path. Instead, we can use the identity for the product of cosines and sines in terms of the sine of multiple angles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity for the product of sines in terms of the sine of multiple angles. We can also use the fact that the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression can be simplified using the formula:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sin \left( \frac{k \pi}{n} \right) = \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}.
\]
For $n=9$, we have:
\[
\sin \frac{\pi}{9} \sin \frac{2\pi}{9} \sin \frac{3\pi}{9} \sin \frac{4\pi}{9} \sin \frac{5\pi}{9} \sin \frac{6\pi}{9} \sin \frac{7\pi}{9} \sin \frac{8\pi}{9} = \frac{9}{2^8}.
\]
Since $\sin \frac{5\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{140^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 140^\circ$, $\sin \frac{6\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{120^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 120^\circ$, $\sin \frac{7\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{140^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 160^\circ$, and $\sin \frac{8\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{160^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 160^\circ$, we can rewrite the product as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{9}{2^8} = \frac{9}{256}.

In cylindrical coordinates, $(r, \theta, z)$ represents the radial distance, the angular coordinate, and the height above the $xy$-plane, respectively.

[ADVANCE]

The equation $z = c$ indicates that the height above the $xy$-plane is constant, regardless of the values of $r$ and $\theta$. This means that for any point on the plane, the $z$-coordinate is fixed at $c$, while the $r$ and $\theta$ coordinates can vary freely.

This description corresponds to a plane that is parallel to the $xy$-plane and located at a distance $c$ from it. Since the equation does not impose any restrictions on $r$ or $\theta$, the plane extends infinitely in the horizontal direction.

The equation $z = c$ describes a plane that is parallel to the $xy$-plane and is located at a constant height $c$ above (or below, depending on the sign of $c$) the $xy$-plane. This plane extends infinitely in all horizontal directions.

The problem involves finding the smallest possible angle between two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ given their magnitudes and the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. We can calculate the magnitude of the given cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Given $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2$ and $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7$, we can substitute these values into the equation for the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]
Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{2 \cdot 7} = \frac{1}{2}.

The angle $\theta$ that satisfies $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$ is $\theta = 30^\circ$ or $\theta = 150^\circ$. Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, we take $\theta = 30^\circ$.

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient and $b$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are the values of $x$ such that $f(x + 5) = 0$. If $r_1, r_2, r_3$ are the roots of $f(x)$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x)$ can be found using the coefficients of $f(x)$. For the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, the sum of the roots is $-\frac{-49}{1} = 49$.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34$.

The problem involves finding the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all but one of its interior angles is $1070^{\circ}$.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. Let's denote the unknown interior angle by $x$. According to the problem, the sum of all but one of the interior angles is $1070^{\circ}$, so the sum of all the interior angles is $1070^{\circ} + x$. This sum must equal $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$.

We can set up the equation:
\[1070^{\circ} + x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}.\]

Since $x$ is an interior angle of a convex polygon, we know that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$.

[ADVANCE]

We can express $x$ as:
\[x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}.\]
Since $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$, we can set up the inequality:
\[0^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}.\]
We can split this inequality into two parts:
\[0^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ},\]
\[(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}.\]

[ADVANCE]

Solving the first part of the inequality:
\[0^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ},\]
\[(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} > 1070^{\circ},\]
\[n-2 > \frac{1070^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}},\]
\[n-2 > 5.944,\]
\[n > 7.944.\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \geq 8$.

Solving the second part of the inequality:
\[(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ},\]
\[(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ},\]
\[n-2 < \frac{1250^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}},\]
\[n-2 < 6.944,\]
\[n < 8.944.\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \leq 8$.

Combining the two results, we get:
\[8 \leq n \leq 8.\]
Therefore, $n = 8$.

The problem requires finding a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

We start with the congruence equation:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find that \( 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Using \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \), we get:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
And using \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \), we get:
\[ t \equiv -1 - 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we check the solutions. The solution \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \) is even, so we discard it. The solution \( t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \) is equivalent to \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \), but we need an odd solution. We re-evaluate the calculation for \( t \equiv -1 - 18 \pmod{23} \) and find that it indeed equals \( t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \), which is \( t = 4 \) or \( t = -19 + 23 = 4 \). However, we need to find the odd solution, so we recheck the calculation.

[ADVANCE]

We recheck the calculation for the odd solution. We have \( t \equiv -1 - 18 \pmod{23} \), which gives \( t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \). Converting this to a positive equivalent within the range \( 0 < t < 23 \), we get \( t = 4 \), which is even. We need to find the odd solution, so we re-evaluate the quadratic congruence and its solutions.

Given the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), we can also try to find the solution by testing odd values of \( t \) between 1 and 22.

By testing odd values, we find that for \( t = 11 \):
\[ 11^2 + 2 \cdot 11 - 1 = 121 + 22 - 1 = 142 \equiv 142 - 6 \cdot 23 = 142 - 138 = 4 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
For \( t = 13 \):
\[ 13^2 + 2 \cdot 13 - 1 = 169 + 26 - 1 = 194 \equiv 194 - 8 \cdot 23 = 194 - 184 = 10 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
For \( t = 15 \):
\[ 15^2 + 2 \cdot 15 - 1 = 225 + 30 - 1 = 254 \equiv 254 - 11 \cdot 23 = 254 - 253 = 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 15 \) satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is \( t = 15 \).

The final answer is: \boxed{15}

The problem involves finding the solutions to the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). We need to simplify the expression inside the sine function using the properties of inverse trigonometric functions.

[ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1} (x)\) is \(\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\) and the range of \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) is \((0, \pi)\), we can simplify the expression using the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x\).

Thus, \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\).

Now, we can substitute this into the original equation:
\[\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have:

This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the equation holds for all \(x \neq 0\) is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

However, we can see that the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) simplifies to \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is not possible.

However, we need to be careful with the domain and range of the inverse trigonometric functions.

Let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then, \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\). Substituting this into the original equation, we get:

This simplifies to:

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have:

The problem involves finding the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The lines are defined by their direction vectors and points on the lines. The direction vectors are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), which are parallel since one is a scalar multiple of the other. The points on the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The formula involves the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point on each line, and then taking the magnitude of the result.

First, we need to find the vector connecting a point on each line. Let's call this vector \(\mathbf{PQ}\), where \(P = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(Q = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). So,
\[
\mathbf{PQ} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we need to find the cross product of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{PQ} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

The cross product \(\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
\[
\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ} = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

We also need the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

The distance \(D\) between the two parallel lines is given by:
\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

To find the number of points with integer coordinates in the interior of the rectangle, we need to determine the range of $x$ and $y$ values that lie strictly inside the rectangle. The $x$-coordinates of the vertices range from $-5$ to $5$, and the $y$-coordinates range from $-4$ to $4$. Therefore, the interior of the rectangle will have $x$-coordinates ranging from $-4$ to $4$ (exclusive) and $y$-coordinates ranging from $-3$ to $3$ (exclusive).

We will use the properties of the cross product to expand the expression.

We can expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ using the distributive property of the cross product:
\[

\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}),

So, the expression becomes:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

Substituting the given values, we have:

The prices of the stamps are:

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ bisects angle $\angle BAD$. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$ given that the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is 42.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects angle $\angle BAD$, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem which states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. However, in this case, we need to focus on the properties of the trapezoid and the right triangle $\triangle ACD$.

Let's denote the length of $\overline{AD}$ as $a$, the length of $\overline{BC}$ as $b$, the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$, and the length of $\overline{CD}$ as $c$. Since $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c$.

The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is given by the formula $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b) \cdot h = 42$. We need to find the relationship between the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and the trapezoid $ABCD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of the trapezoid and $\triangle ACD$, the height of the trapezoid is also $h$. The area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c$. To find the area of $\triangle ACD$, we need to find the relationship between $c$ and the total area of the trapezoid.

Notice that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ share the same height $h$, and the base of $\triangle ABC$ is $b$ while the base of $\triangle ACD$ is $c$. Since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, the height from $B$ to $\overline{AD}$ is also $h$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h$.

The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h + \frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c = 42$. This simplifies to $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot (b + c) = 42$.

[ADVANCE]

We can see that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c$. To find this area, we need to express $c$ in terms of the total area of the trapezoid. Notice that the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and the trapezoid $ABCD$ is the same as the ratio of the base $c$ to the sum of the bases $a + b$.

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects angle $\angle BAD$, the triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ are similar to each other in a certain sense, but we need to use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of the two triangles.

Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Then the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $42 - x$. The ratio of the areas of the triangles is the same as the ratio of their bases because they share the same height. However, we need to use the given information more effectively.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, the height of $\triangle ABC$ is the same as the height of $\triangle ACD$, which is $h$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h$ and the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot c \cdot h$. The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$.

We can use the fact that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is a part of the total area of the trapezoid. Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects angle $\angle BAD$, we can use the angle bisector properties, but in this case, we can directly use the area ratio.

The area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c$ and the area of the trapezoid is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot (a + b) = 42$. We need to find the value of $\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot c$.

Since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and the trapezoid is the same as the ratio of the base $c$ to the sum of the bases $a + b$. However, we can use a simpler approach by noticing that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is half the area of the trapezoid because the height is the same and the base $c$ is effectively half the sum of the bases in terms of the area ratio given the angle bisector condition.

Thus, the area of $\triangle ACD$ is half of the area of the trapezoid $ABCD$, which is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by eliminating the square roots by cross-multiplying and then squaring both sides of the equation.

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2} \implies 2\sqrt{2x} = 3\sqrt{3x-1}
\]

Next, we square both sides of the equation to remove the square roots:

\[
(2\sqrt{2x})^2 = (3\sqrt{3x-1})^2 \implies 4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1) \implies 8x = 27x - 9
\]

Now, we can solve for \(x\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:

\[
8x - 27x = -9 \implies -19x = -9 \implies x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Next, we need to verify that the solution satisfies the original equation, ensuring that the values inside the square roots are non-negative and the denominator is not zero.

Next action: [VERIFY]
We need to check that the solution \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) satisfies the original equation and that the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative.

First, we check the expression inside the square root in the denominator:

\[
3x - 1 = 3 \left(\frac{9}{19}\right) - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0
\]

Since \(3x - 1 > 0\), the expression inside the square root in the denominator is positive.

We can substitute the values from the given fractions into the operation: $\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)$. Now, we can simplify the expression step by step.

First, calculate the product of the numerators: $(7)(10) = 70$.

Next, simplify the fraction $\frac{21}{30}$: $\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10}$.

Now, multiply the product of the numerators by the simplified fraction: $70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{7}{10} = 7 \cdot 7 = 49$.

The problem involves determining the probability that two randomly chosen segments on the circumference of a circle intersect. To approach this, we need to consider the geometric properties and the possible arrangements of the points.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the order in which the points are arranged on the circle determines whether the segments intersect. Specifically, the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are arranged in an alternating manner, i.e., the points are in the order $ACBD$ or $ADBC$ when moving around the circle.

Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, we can fix the position of one point, say $A$, and consider the relative positions of the other three points. The total number of ways to arrange the points $B$, $C$, and $D$ relative to $A$ is $3! = 6$.

Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in intersecting segments: $ACBD$ and $ADBC$. Therefore, the probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.

The problem of finding the probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect when four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle can be solved by considering the relative positions of the points. The key insight is that the segments intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating manner. With this in mind, we can calculate the probability as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

The problem involves finding the measure of angle $\angle ADC$ in a diagram with two concentric circles. The larger circle has a radius of 2, and the smaller circle has a radius of 1. The total area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The area of the larger circle is $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$. The area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, which is $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.

The shaded region consists of the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle. Let the measure of $\angle ADC$ be $\theta$ degrees. The area of the sector of the larger circle is $\frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi \cdot 2^2 = \frac{2\theta\pi}{90} = \frac{\theta\pi}{45}$. The area of the sector of the smaller circle is $\frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi \cdot 1^2 = \frac{\theta\pi}{360}$.

The area of the shaded region is the difference between the area of the sector of the larger circle and the area of the sector of the smaller circle: $\frac{\theta\pi}{45} - \frac{\theta\pi}{360} = \frac{8\theta\pi - \theta\pi}{360} = \frac{7\theta\pi}{360} = \frac{7\theta\pi}{360}$.

We know that the area of the shaded region is $\frac{5\pi}{3}$, so we can set up the equation: $\frac{7\theta\pi}{360} = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can solve the equation for $\theta$: $\frac{7\theta\pi}{360} = \frac{5\pi}{3}$. Dividing both sides by $\pi$, we get $\frac{7\theta}{360} = \frac{5}{3}$. Multiplying both sides by 360, we get $7\theta = 600$. Dividing both sides by 7, we get $\theta = \frac{600}{7} = 85.7142857143$, but since the problem is likely looking for an exact answer in degrees, we can leave it as a fraction or find the closest degree measure.

However, the problem seems to be looking for an exact answer in degrees, and the calculation yields a precise value. We can box the answer as it is.

The problem involves finding the volume of a cylindrical beaker and a spherical tank, and then determining how many beakers of water are needed to fill the tank. We need to use the formulas for the volume of a cylinder and the volume of a sphere.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

Given:
- The height of the cylindrical beaker is 8 cm.
- The radius of the cylindrical beaker is 3 cm.
- The radius of the spherical tank is 6 cm.

We can calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker and the volume of the spherical tank, and then find the number of beakers needed to fill the tank.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, we calculate the volume of the spherical tank:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

To find the number of beakers needed to fill the tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical beaker:
\[ \text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 beakers of water to fill the spherical tank.

The problem requires evaluating the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\).

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), \(\alpha\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), \(\beta\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting the values of \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\), we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{21})^2}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -\frac{9}{100}

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary counting or directly count the number of valid subcommittees. Here, we will directly count the number of valid subcommittees by considering the different possible combinations of Republicans and Democrats.

The possible distributions of Republicans (R) and Democrats (D) in the subcommittee of 5 members, ensuring at least one member from each party, are:
- 1R and 4D
- 2R and 3D
- 3R and 2D

We will calculate the number of ways for each distribution and sum them up.

[ADVANCE]

1. For 1R and 4D:
\[ \binom{8}{1} \times \binom{6}{4} = 8 \times 15 = 120 \]

2. For 2R and 3D:

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). The product of these integers is given by:
\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]
The mean of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]
According to the problem, the product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]
\[

\]
\[

\]
We now have two possible values for \(n\): 5 and -5. We need to check which of these values satisfy the original equation \((n-1)n(n+1) = 120\).

[ADVANCE]

For \(n = 5\):
\[

For \(n = -5\):
\[

This does not satisfy the original equation.

Therefore, the only valid solution is \(n = 5\). The three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The largest of these integers is \(6\).

Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}

Let $\angle BAC = \theta.$ Then $\angle BDC = 3\theta.$ Since $AM$ is the altitude, $\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ.$ Let $BM = CM = x.$ Then $BC = 2x.$

In $\triangle ABM,$ we have $\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}.$

In $\triangle BDM,$ we have $\tan 3\theta = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x.$

We can use the triple angle formula for tangent: $\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}.$ Substituting $\tan \theta = \frac{x}{11},$ we get:
\[
x = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{x}{11} - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{3x \cdot 121 - x^3}{1331}}{\frac{121 - 3x^2}{121}} = \frac{363x - x^3}{121 - 3x^2} \cdot \frac{1}{11} = \frac{363x - x^3}{1331 - 33x^2}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by $1331 - 33x^2,$ we get:
\[
x(1331 - 33x^2) = 363x - x^3,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
1331x - 33x^3 = 363x - x^3,
\]
or
\[
1331x - 363x = 33x^3 - x^3,
\]
which further simplifies to:
\[
968x = 32x^3.
\]
Dividing both sides by $32x$ (assuming $x \neq 0$), we get:
\[
30.5 = x^2,
\]
so
\[
x = \sqrt{30.5} = \sqrt{\frac{61}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{122}}{2}.

Now, we can find $AB$ using the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle ABM:$
\[
AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{122}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \frac{122}{4}} = \sqrt{121 + 30.5} = \sqrt{151.5} = \sqrt{\frac{303}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{606}}{2}.

The problem involves finding the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is $3^7$. Since the integers are consecutive, the median will be the 14th term in the sequence (because 27 is an odd number). Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $x$. Then, the 27 consecutive integers can be written as $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum is $3^7$, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the first and last term is $\frac{x + (x+26)}{2} = x+13$. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 3^7. \]

We can simplify this equation to solve for $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We start by simplifying the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 3^7. \]
Since $27 = 3^3$, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ 3^3(x+13) = 3^7. \]
Dividing both sides by $3^3$, we get:
\[ x+13 = 3^4. \]
Since $3^4 = 81$, we have:
\[ x+13 = 81. \]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we find:

The problem requires finding the real values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can break this into two separate inequalities: $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$ and $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. Since $x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ (as it is a sum of even powers of $x$ with positive coefficients), this inequality is satisfied for all real $x$.

Next, we focus on the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this inequality as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. To solve this, we can make a substitution, say $y = x^2$, which transforms the inequality into $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we solve the quadratic inequality $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We factor the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. The roots of the equation $(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0$ are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, -7)$, $(-7, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$. We test a point from the interval $(-7, 3)$, for example, $y = 0$, and find that $(0 + 7)(0 - 3) = -21 < 0$, which satisfies the inequality. Therefore, the solution to the inequality $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$ is $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we substitute back to get $-7 < x^2 < 3$. Because $x^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$, the inequality simplifies to $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which is equivalent to $-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

[OUTPUT]

The solution to the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ is the interval $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z &= 12.
\end{align*}
We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that:
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relationship between $s$ and $p$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We are given the equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be factored as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = 12,\]
where $s = x + y + z$. Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $p = xy + yz + zx$ and $q = xyz = 4$, we have:
\[sp - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to:
\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
so:
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\]
\[sp = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
So, we have:
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which simplifies to:
\[s^3 = 64.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[s = 4.\]
Now, we can find $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s} = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $p = 6$.

To determine the grade for which the number of male bus riders is closest to $135\%$ of the number of female bus riders, we need to calculate the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders for each grade and compare it to $1.35$ (since $135\% = 1.35$).

Let's denote the number of male students in a grade as $M$ and the number of female students in a grade as $F$. The number of male bus riders is given by the percentage of male students who ride the bus, and similarly for female students.

For the $9^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade:
- Percentage of male bus riders: $41.1\%$
- Percentage of female bus riders: $39.4\%$
- Number of male bus riders: $0.411 \times 300 = 123.3$
- Number of female bus riders: $0.394 \times 300 = 118.2$
- Ratio of male to female bus riders: $\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.04$

For the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade:
- Percentage of male bus riders: $34.4\%$

- Ratio of male to female bus riders: $\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.04$

For the $11^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade:
- Percentage of male bus riders: $20.6\%$
- Percentage of female bus riders: $13.8\%$
- Number of male bus riders: $0.206 \times 300 = 61.8$
- Number of female bus riders: $0.138 \times 300 = 41.4$
- Ratio of male to female bus riders: $\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.49$

For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade:
- Percentage of male bus riders: $11.6\%$
- Percentage of female bus riders: $8.6\%$
- Number of male bus riders: $0.116 \times 300 = 34.8$
- Number of female bus riders: $0.086 \times 300 = 25.8$

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to solve this inequality for \(x\).

The numerator is an absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative (or zero). The denominator is a quadratic expression \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).

To solve the inequality, we need to consider when the fraction is negative. Since the numerator is always non-negative, the fraction will be negative when the denominator is negative, except when the numerator is zero.

[ADVANCE]

1. Find the values of \(x\) that make the numerator zero: \(x^2 - 81 = 0 \implies x = \pm 9\).
2. Find the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero: \(x^2 - 36x = 0 \implies x(x - 36) = 0 \implies x = 0\) or \(x = 36\).
3. Determine the intervals to test for the sign of the denominator: The critical points are \(x = -9, 0, 9, 36\). We need to test the sign of the expression \(x(x - 36)\) in the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

[ADVANCE]

1. Test the sign of \(x(x - 36)\) in each interval:
   - In \((-\infty, -9)\), both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are negative, so \(x(x - 36) > 0\).
   - In \((-9, 0)\), \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, so \(x(x - 36) > 0\).
   - In \((0, 9)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, so \(x(x - 36) < 0\).
   - In \((9, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, so \(x(x - 36) < 0\).
   - In \((36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are positive, so \(x(x - 36) > 0\).

[ADVANCE]

1. Since the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, the fraction \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) will be negative when the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) is negative.
2. From the sign analysis, the denominator is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).
3. We must exclude the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). We also need to exclude \(x = 9\) because it makes the numerator zero, and the fraction is undefined at this point.

[ADVANCE]

1. Combining the intervals where the denominator is negative and excluding the critical points, the solution to the inequality is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

# We can express $L$ in terms of $W$ from the equation: $L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}$.

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this side as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, $\sin T = \frac{\text{opposite side to } T}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{s}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The problem asks for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. We need to find the minimum distance from the origin to any point $(x, y)$ on the graph. The distance $D$ from the origin to a point $(x, y)$ is given by $D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can express the distance $D$ in terms of $x$ by substituting $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ into the distance formula:
\[D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^2-3\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9\right)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}.\]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of $x^2$. Let $u = x^2$, then the expression becomes:
\[D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}}.\]
We need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function $f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of the quadratic function $f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}$, we can complete the square or use the vertex formula. The vertex of a parabola given by $f(u) = au^2 + bu + c$ occurs at $u = -\frac{b}{2a}$. Here, $a = \frac{1}{2}$ and $b = -2$, so:
\[u = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{1} = 2.\]
We substitute $u = 2$ back into the function to find the minimum value:
\[f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4 - 8 + 9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.\]
So, the minimum value of the expression inside the square root is $\frac{5}{2}$. Therefore, the minimum distance is:
\[D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.\]
The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$.

First, we need to find $f^{-1}(0)$. This means we need to solve $f(x) = 0$ for $x$. We have two cases to consider based on the definition of $f(x)$.

**Case 1:** For $x \leq 3$, we solve $3 - x = 0$. This gives $x = 3$.

**Case 2:** For $x > 3$, we solve $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0$. Factoring out $x$, we get $x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0$. Since $x > 3$, $x \neq 0$, so we solve $-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $2^2 - 4(-1)(3) = 4 + 12 = 16$, which is positive, so there are real solutions. However, we need to check if the solutions satisfy $x > 3$. The solutions are given by $x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}$. This gives us $x = -1$ and $x = 3$, but since $x > 3$, neither of these solutions is valid in this case.

Since the only valid solution is from Case 1, we have $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.

Next, we need to find $f^{-1}(6)$. This means we need to solve $f(x) = 6$ for $x$. Again, we have two cases to consider.

**Case 1:** For $x \leq 3$, we solve $3 - x = 6$. This gives $x = -3$, which satisfies $x \leq 3$.

**Case 2:** For $x > 3$, we solve $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6$. Rearranging, we get $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0$. We can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, but it's not straightforward to solve without further analysis or numerical methods. However, we already have a valid solution from Case 1, so we can proceed with that.

Since the valid solution is from Case 1, we have $f^{-1}(6) = -3$.

Now, we can calculate $f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0$.

To find the base 7 and base 8 representations of $629_{10}$, we need to perform successive divisions by 7 and 8, respectively, and keep track of the remainders.

**Converting $629_{10}$ to base 7:**

1. $629 \div 7 = 89$ remainder $6$
2. $89 \div 7 = 12$ remainder $5$
3. $12 \div 7 = 1$ remainder $5$
4. $1 \div 7 = 0$ remainder $1$

So, the base 7 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1556_7$.

**Converting $629_{10}$ to base 8:**

1. $629 \div 8 = 78$ remainder $5$
2. $78 \div 8 = 9$ remainder $6$
3. $9 \div 8 = 1$ remainder $1$
4. $1 \div 8 = 0$ remainder $1$

So, the base 8 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1165_8$.

Now that we have the base 7 representation ($1556_7$) and the base 8 representation ($1165_8$) of $629_{10}$, we need to compare the digits in these representations to find the common digits.

The digits in the base 7 representation are: 1, 5, 5, 6.
The digits in the base 8 representation are: 1, 1, 6, 5.

We can see that the digits 1, 5, and 6 are present in both representations.

To find the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$, we need to evaluate $g(1)$, since the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial $p(x)$ is equal to $p(1)$. Therefore, we need to find $f(1-1) = f(0)$.

The problem requires finding the shortest distance from a point to a line. The point is given as $(6, 0)$, and the line is given in the form $y = 2x - 2$. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the shortest distance, we can use the formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$, which is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)$. Now, we can substitute these values into the distance formula.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Substituting the values of $A$, $B$, $C$, $x_1$, and $y_1$ into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:
\[

The given polynomial equation is $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. We can use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a polynomial $x^4 + bx^3 + c = 0$ with roots $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$, Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -b = -2,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

We need to find the unordered set $\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}$.

Let's denote the expressions we need to find as $a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. We know that:
\[
a + b + c = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 0.
\]
So, we have $a + b + c = 0$.

We also know that:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = -2(-2) = 4.
\]
Thus, we have $abc = 4$.

Since $a + b + c = 0$ and $abc = 4$, the unordered set $\{a, b, c\}$ consists of the roots of the polynomial $t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0$, which simplifies to $t^3 + (ab+bc+ca)t - 4 = 0$. We need to find the value of $ab + bc + ca$.

By multiplying the equation $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0$ by $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4$, we get:

This can be rewritten as:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3)) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_4)) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)) + (\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)) = 0.
\]
Using $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2$, we can substitute $\alpha_4 = -2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \alpha_3$, and similarly for the other roots. After some algebraic manipulations, we can find that:
\[
ab + bc + ca = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = -2.

The polynomial $t^3 - 2t - 4 = 0$ can be factored or solved using numerical methods. By inspection, we can see that $t = 2$ is a root. We can perform polynomial division to factorize the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - 2t - 4 = (t - 2)(t^2 + 2t + 2) = 0.

The quadratic equation $t^2 + 2t + 2 = 0$ can be solved using the quadratic formula:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2i}{2} = -1 \pm i.

[ADVANCE]

To convert $\frac{137}{500}$ into a decimal, we can perform the division. However, it's often easier to manipulate the fraction to have a denominator that is a power of 10, which simplifies the conversion to a decimal.

Now, we can easily convert this fraction to a decimal:

\frac{274}{1000} = 0.274

The decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$ is 0.274.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region of points closer to $O$ than to any vertex, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $O$ to a vertex will divide the plane into two regions: one closer to $O$ and the other closer to the vertex. The intersection of these regions will give us the area where a point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex.

Consider the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$. These bisectors will form a smaller rectangle whose center is also $O$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the line segments joining $O$ to the vertices of the original rectangle.

Let's denote the coordinates of $A$ as $(-a, b)$, $B$ as $(a, b)$, $C$ as $(a, -b)$, and $D$ as $(-a, -b)$. The center $O$ will be at the origin $(0, 0)$. The midpoint of $OA$ will be $\left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)$, the midpoint of $OB$ will be $\left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)$, the midpoint of $OC$ will be $\left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)$, and the midpoint of $OD$ will be $\left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)$.

The area of the smaller rectangle (where points are closer to $O$) will be $\left(\frac{a}{2} - \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right) \times \left(\frac{b}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right) = ab$.

The area of the original rectangle $ABCD$ is $2a \times 2b = 4ab$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is $\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}$.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the part of the function \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \) for \( n \geq 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the part of the function \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \) for \( n \geq 4 \).

Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2,$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i.$ Note that $\omega^3 - 1 = 0$ can be factored as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.$ Since $\omega \neq 1,$ we have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$

We can use this relationship to simplify the given expression. Let's calculate $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.$

[ADVANCE]

We can find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.\]
Since $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0,$ we can substitute these values into the expression:
\[\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + (\omega + \omega^2)}{2 + (\omega + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.\]
