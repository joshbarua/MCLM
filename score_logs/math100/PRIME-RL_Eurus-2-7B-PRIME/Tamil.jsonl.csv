We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$. We need to find the length of $DE$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7$. We are also given that $EF = 7$.

Let's denote the length of $DF$ as $x$. Then, we have $\frac{7}{x} = 0.7$. We can solve for $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can solve the equation $\frac{7}{x} = 0.7$ for $x$:
\[
x = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10.
\]
So, the length of $DF$ is 10.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Here, $DF$ is the hypotenuse, so we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2.
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49.
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51.
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}.
\]

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given two complex numbers $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$ which is obtained by rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in the counterclockwise direction.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find $w$, we can use the formula for rotating a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]
Here, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, so $e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}$.

First, we need to calculate $z - c$:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3i - 3\sqrt{2}i = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]

Next, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\pi/4}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) (1+i) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2}i - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i^2) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2}i - 3i - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (3 + \sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2} + (\sqrt{2} - 3 - 3\sqrt{2})i) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (3 + 4\sqrt{2} + (-3 - 2\sqrt{2})i) \]
\[ = \frac{3 + 4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{-3 - 2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}i \]
\[ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} + 4 + \left( \frac{-3}{\sqrt{2}} - 2 \right)i \]
\[ = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 4 + \left( \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2 \right)i \]

Now, we add $c$ to this result to find $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (2 - 3i) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 4 + \left( \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2 \right)i \right) \]
\[ = 2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 4 + (-3 + \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2)i \]
\[ = 6 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( -5 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)i \]

So, the complex number $w$ is:
\[ w = 6 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( -5 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)i \]

The problem requires simplifying the square root of 242. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To simplify $\sqrt{242}$, we first find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is $11^2$. So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root expression:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves finding the number of ways to arrange 8 people in a circular manner, with the condition that 3 specific individuals (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can treat the 3 individuals (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) as a single block or unit. This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the 5 remaining individuals plus the block of 3) in a circular manner.

The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange 6 units in a circle is $(6-1)! = 5! = 120$.

Next, we need to consider the arrangements of the 3 individuals within the block. There are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people in a circular manner, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is the product of the number of ways to arrange the units and the number of ways to arrange the individuals within the block: $120 \times 6 = 720$.

The problem asks for the term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) that does not contain a constant term.

To find this term, we need to use the binomial theorem, which states that \((a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\).

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]
Simplifying the general term, we get:
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k}
\]
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. So, we set the exponent of \(x\) equal to zero and solve for \(k\):
\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
k = 3
\]
Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term to find the constant term:
\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]
\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]
\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \cdot 5 \cdot 4
\]
\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \cdot 20

\[
T_3 = -\frac{100 \cdot 20}{8}
\]
\[
T_3 = -\frac{2000}{8}

\[
T_3 = -250

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-250}\).

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$. We need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. However, we can also directly work with the congruence relation to simplify the expression.

We can rewrite the expression $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ in terms of the congruence relation:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

So, the product becomes:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 24 \pmod{7}.
\]

We can simplify 24 modulo 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

The problem involves a fair five-sided die (a pentagon) rotating around its center and returning to its original position. We need to determine the minimum number of degrees the die must be rotated to return to its original position.

A fair five-sided die has 5 sides, and each side is identical. When the die is rotated around its center, it will return to its original position after a full rotation or a fraction of a full rotation that is a multiple of the number of sides.

The total degrees in a full rotation is 360 degrees. To find the minimum number of degrees the die must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to find the smallest angle that is a multiple of the fraction of the full rotation that corresponds to one side of the die.

Since the die has 5 sides, the die will return to its original position after a rotation of 360 degrees divided by 5, which is the angle corresponding to one side of the die.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The calculation for the minimum number of degrees the die must be rotated to return to its original position is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

However, the problem asks for the minimum number of degrees the die must be rotated to return to its original position, which implies a full rotation or a multiple of the full rotation. Since 72 degrees is the angle for one side, the die will return to its original position after a rotation of 360 degrees, which is the smallest full rotation.

But, we need to consider if there is a smaller rotation that can bring the die to its original position by rotating to the next side and back. Since the die has 5 sides, the smallest rotation that can bring the die to the same position by rotating to the next side and back is indeed 72 degrees, but we need to check if there is any smaller rotation that can achieve the same result.

Since 72 degrees is the smallest angle that can bring the die to the next side, and any smaller rotation will not bring the die to its original position, the minimum number of degrees the die must be rotated to return to its original position is indeed 72 degrees.

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram, given the coordinates of the other three vertices. The coordinates of the vertices are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y), with the condition that $x > 7$. We need to find the value of $x + y$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by the vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
Now, let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by the vertices (6, 8) and (x, y):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 6$ is not a valid solution. Let's consider the other pair of vertices to form the diagonals.

We can also calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by the vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
Now, let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by the vertices (7, 4) and (x, y):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 4$ is not a valid solution. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's consider the vector approach. The midpoint of the diagonal formed by (5, 3) and (7, 4) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal formed by (6, 8) and (x, y). The vector from (5, 3) to (7, 4) is (2, 1). The vector from (6, 8) to (x, y) should be the same. So, we can write:
\[
(x, y) - (6, 8) = (2, 1) \implies (x, y) = (6+2, 8+1) = (8, 9)
\]
Here, $x = 8$ and $y = 9$, and $x > 7$, so this solution is valid. Now, we can find $x + y$:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

We know that $\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ and $\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. This simplifies to $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$.

We also know that $\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$. Using the relationship we just found, we can substitute $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$ into the expression for $\tan A$.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$ into the expression for $\tan A$, we get:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \) depends on the degrees of the polynomials \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \). In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

Let $\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$. Then, we have \[\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.\]

The norm of this vector is \[\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.\]

We also have \[\|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.\]

The inequality we need to satisfy is \[\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \le C \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.\]

Squaring both sides, we get \[4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \le C^2 (x^2 + y^2).\]

Rearranging terms, we have \[4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \le C^2 x^2 + C^2 y^2,\] \[(C^2 - 4)x^2 - 12xy + (C^2 - 13)y^2 \ge 0.\]

For this inequality to hold for all $x$ and $y$, the quadratic form must be positive semi-definite. This means the matrix \[\begin{pmatrix} C^2 - 4 & -6 \\ -6 & C^2 - 13 \end{pmatrix}\] must be positive semi-definite.

The condition for a $2 \times 2$ matrix to be positive semi-definite is that its leading principal minors are non-negative. The first leading principal minor is $C^2 - 4 \ge 0$, and the second leading principal minor is \[(C^2 - 4)(C^2 - 13) - 36 \ge 0.\]

From the first condition, we get $C^2 \ge 4$, so $C \ge 2$.

Expanding the second condition, we have \[C^4 - 17C^2 + 52 - 36 \ge 0,\] \[C^4 - 17C^2 + 16 \ge 0.\]

Let $u = C^2$. Then, we have \[u^2 - 17u + 16 \ge 0.\]

Factoring the quadratic, we get \[(u - 1)(u - 16) \ge 0.\]

So, we have $u \le 1$ or $u \ge 16$. Since $u = C^2$ and $C^2 \ge 4$, we must have $C^2 \ge 16$, which gives $C \ge 4$.

Therefore, the smallest positive real number $C$ that satisfies the inequality is $C = \boxed{4}$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express the equation as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. This can be factored as $(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0$. Given that $z \neq 1$, we have $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$.

We can use this equation to find the value of the expression $z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$. First, we note that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ can be rewritten as $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1$.

[ADVANCE]

We can divide the equation $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ by $z^2$ to get $\frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{z} + 1 + z + \frac{1}{z^2} = 0$, which simplifies to $z^2 + z + 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^2} = 0$. Rearranging terms, we get $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + z + \frac{1}{z} = -1$.

[ADVANCE]

Let $x = z + \frac{1}{z}$. Then, we have $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)^2 - 2 = x^2 - 2$. Substituting this into the equation $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + z + \frac{1}{z} = -1$, we get $x^2 - 2 + x = -1$, which simplifies to $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

We can solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = -1$, so we have $x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Since $x = z + \frac{1}{z}$, we have $z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = x^2 - 2 + x = -1$. Therefore, the value of the expression is $\boxed{-1}$.

\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0\]

So, the base 9 representation of $36_{10}$ is $40_9$.

The problem requires simplifying the given trigonometric expression:
\[\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.\]
We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression using the identity \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.\]
To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator:
\[\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.\]
Using the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\), we get:
\[\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.\]

The problem involves comparing the weights of different objects: truffles (T), squares (S), and coals (C). We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ten truffles, three squares, and one coal weigh the same.
2. Two truffles and one coal weigh the same as one square.

We need to find out how many truffles have the same weight as one square.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the weight of one truffle as $T$, the weight of one square as $S$, and the weight of one coal as $C$. From the given information, we can form the following equations:

1. $10T + 3S + C = x$ (where $x$ is the common weight)
2. $2T + C = S$

We can use the second equation to express $C$ in terms of $S$ and $T$:
\[ C = S - 2T \]

Now, substitute the expression for $C$ into the first equation:
\[ 10T + 3S + (S - 2T) = x \]
\[ 10T + 3S + S - 2T = x \]
\[ 8T + 4S = x \]

Since $10T + 3S + C = x$ and $2T + C = S$, we can also express $x$ in terms of $S$ and $T$ using the second equation. We already have $x = 8T + 4S$. Now, we need to find the relationship between $S$ and $T$.

From the equation $2T + C = S$, we can express $C$ as $S - 2T$. We can substitute this back into the first equation to find the relationship between $S$ and $T$.

Since $10T + 3S + C = x$ and $C = S - 2T$, we have:
\[ 10T + 3S + S - 2T = x \]
\[ 8T + 4S = x \]

We can also express $x$ as $S + 2T + S$ from the second equation scaled up to match the weight of the first equation. Since $2T + C = S$, we can multiply the entire equation by 5 to get:
\[ 10T + 5C = 5S \]
Since $C = S - 2T$, we substitute to get:
\[ 10T + 5(S - 2T) = 5S \]
\[ 10T + 5S - 10T = 5S \]
This equation is an identity and doesn't provide new information. Instead, we can use the fact that $8T + 4S = x$ and $10T + 3S + C = x$ and $C = S - 2T$ to find the relationship.

Since $8T + 4S = 10T + 3S + S - 2T$, we have:
\[ 8T + 4S = 8T + 4S \]
This is an identity, so we need to find the ratio of $S$ to $T$. We can use the equation $2T + C = S$ and substitute $C = S - 2T$ to find:
\[ S = 2T + S - 2T \]
This doesn't provide new information. Instead, we can express $S$ in terms of $T$ using the weights. Since $8T + 4S = x$ and we need to find how many truffles have the same weight as one square, we can express $S$ as $kT$ where $k$ is the number of truffles equivalent to one square.

Let's solve for $k$:
\[ S = kT \]
Substitute $S = kT$ into $2T + C = S$:
\[ 2T + C = kT \]
\[ C = kT - 2T \]
\[ C = (k - 2)T \]
Now substitute $S = kT$ and $C = (k - 2)T$ into $10T + 3S + C = x$:
\[ 10T + 3(kT) + (k - 2)T = x \]
\[ 10T + 3kT + kT - 2T = x \]
\[ (10 + 3k + k - 2)T = x \]
\[ (8 + 4k)T = x \]
We also have $S + 2T + S = x$ from the scaled equation:
\[ kT + 2T + kT = x \]
\[ (2k + 2)T = x \]
Equate the two expressions for $x$:
\[ (8 + 4k)T = (2k + 2)T \]
\[ 8 + 4k = 2k + 2 \]
\[ 2k = -6 \]
\[ k = -3 \]
This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem since weight can't be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

From $2T + C = S$, we can express $C$ as $S - 2T$. Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 10T + 3S + S - 2T = x \]
\[ 8T + 4S = x \]
We need to find the ratio of $S$ to $T$. Let's use the fact that $10T + 3S + C = x$ and $2T + C = S$ to find the relationship.

We start by expanding the product of the two quadratic expressions:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we can set up the following equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26

\[

\[

We solve the equation $-2a = 6$ to find $a$:

\[

We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by checking the other equations. First, we solve $3b + 20 = 26$ to confirm $b$:
\[

This matches our previous value of $b$. Finally, we substitute $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into the equation $5b - 6 + 4a = -8$ to verify:

The problem involves finding the radius of a cylindrical tank that is being filled with water at a rate of $20\pi$ cubic meters per minute. The water level rises to a height of 4 meters after some time. We need to determine the radius of the tank.

The volume $V$ of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. In this problem, the height $h$ is 4 meters, and the volume of water added is $20\pi$ cubic meters per minute. We can use the formula to find the radius.

Since the volume of water added is $20\pi$ cubic meters and the height of the water is 4 meters, we can set up the equation:
\[ \pi r^2 \cdot 4 = 20\pi \]

We can simplify this equation to solve for $r$:
\[ 4\pi r^2 = 20\pi \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} \]
\[ r^2 = 5 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax +2a& \text{if } x <a, \end{cases} \]
We need to find the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at most once.

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at most once, the function \( f(x) \) must be monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing). We need to analyze the behavior of the function on both sides of \( x = a \).

For \( x \geq a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax^2 \). For this to be monotonic, the derivative \( f'(x) = 2ax \) must be either non-negative or non-positive for all \( x \geq a \). Since \( x \geq a \), if \( a > 0 \), then \( 2ax \geq 2a^2 > 0 \), so \( f(x) = ax^2 \) is strictly increasing for \( x \geq a \).

For \( x < a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). The derivative \( f'(x) = a \) is a constant. For the function to be monotonic, \( a \) must be either positive or negative. If \( a > 0 \), then \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) is strictly increasing.

Now, we need to ensure that the function does not intersect any horizontal line more than once. This means the function should be continuous and either strictly increasing or decreasing at the point \( x = a \).

[ADVANCE]

We need to check the continuity of the function at \( x = a \). The left-hand limit as \( x \) approaches \( a \) is \( f(a) = aa + 2a = 3a^2 \) (from the \( ax^2 \) part), and the right-hand limit as \( x \) approaches \( a \) is \( f(a) = aa + 2a = aa + 2a = a^2 + 2a \) (from the \( ax + 2a \) part). For the function to be continuous, these two expressions must be equal:
\[ 3a^2 = a^2 + 2a \]
\[ 2a^2 = 2a \]
\[ a^2 = a \]
\[ a(a - 1) = 0 \]
So, \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 1 \). Since we are looking for the largest value of \( a \), we consider \( a = 1 \).

We need to verify that \( a = 1 \) ensures the function is monotonic and does not intersect any horizontal line more than once.

[VERIFY]

For \( a = 1 \), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 1,\\ x + 2& \text{if } x <1. \end{cases} \]
The derivative of \( x^2 \) is \( 2x \), which is positive for \( x \geq 1 \), so \( x^2 \) is strictly increasing for \( x \geq 1 \).
The derivative of \( x + 2 \) is \( 1 \), which is positive, so \( x + 2 \) is strictly increasing for \( x < 1 \).
The function is continuous at \( x = 1 \) since \( 1^2 = 1 + 2 \) is not true, but we check the values: \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \) and \( \lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which indicates a discontinuity. However, we need to ensure the function does not intersect any horizontal line more than once. Given the strictly increasing nature of both parts of the function, this condition is satisfied.

Thus, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at most once is \( \boxed{1} \).

[ADVANCE]

To rewrite the equation in standard form, we need to complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms.

First, let's complete the square for the $x$ terms:
\[x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25.\]

Next, let's complete the square for the $y$ terms:
\[y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9.\]

Now, we can rewrite the original equation using these completed squares:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0.\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0.\]

Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c.\]

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we know that $r^2 = 1^2 = 1$. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[34 - c = 1.\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to find the expression for $f(f(x))$. We start by calculating $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
We are given that $f(f(x)) = x$, so we set the expression equal to $x$:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This is a complex equation, so let's simplify it step by step. First, we expand the expression inside the parentheses:
\[\lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
Expanding further, we get:
\[\lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^2 + \lambda^2 x^3 + \lambda^2 x^3 - \lambda^3 x^4) = x,\]
which simplifies to:
\[\lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^2 + 2\lambda^2 x^3 - \lambda^3 x^4) = x.\]
Distributing $\lambda$, we get:
\[\lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^2 + 2\lambda^3 x^3 - \lambda^4 x^4 = x.\]
Rearranging all terms to one side, we have:
\[\lambda^2 x - \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^2 + 2\lambda^3 x^3 - \lambda^4 x^4 - x = 0.\]
Factoring out $x$, we get:
\[x(\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x - 1 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3) = 0.\]
This gives us two cases: $x = 0$ or $\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x - 1 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 0$.

Next, we need to consider the case where $x \neq 0$. We also need to consider the condition $f(x) \neq x$. Let's find the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = x$:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ or $\lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$.

Since we are given that $f(x) \neq x$, we exclude $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$ from our solutions. Now, we need to find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the equation $\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x - 1 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 0$ and are not equal to $\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$.

We need to find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the equation $\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x - 1 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 0$. To simplify the problem, let's consider the possibility that $x = 1$ is a solution to the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ and $f(x) \neq x$. We substitute $x = 1$ into the equation $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$:
\[f(1) = \lambda \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0.\]
Since $f(1) = 0$, we have $f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0$. However, we need $f(f(1)) = 1$, so $x = 1$ is not a solution.

Next, we consider the possibility that $x = \frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ and $f(x) \neq x$. We substitute $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the equation $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$:
\[f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}.\]
Since $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}$, we have $f(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)) = f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \lambda \cdot \frac{\lambda}{4} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} - \frac{\lambda^3}{16}$.
We need $f(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)) = \frac{1}{2}$, so we set up the equation:
\[\frac{\lambda^2}{4} - \frac{\lambda^3}{16} = \frac{1}{2}.\]
Multiplying through by 16 to clear the denominators, we get:
\[4\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 = 8.\]
Rearranging, we have:
\[\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0.\]
We can try to find the roots of this polynomial equation. By inspection, we find that $\lambda = 2$ is a root:
\[2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0.\]
So, $\lambda = 2$ is a solution. We can factor out $(\lambda - 2)$ from the polynomial:
\[\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = (\lambda - 2)(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4) = 0.\]
The quadratic factor $\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4 = 0$ can be solved using the quadratic formula:
\[\lambda = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}.\]
Since $0 \le \lambda \le 4$, the only valid solution from the quadratic factor is not within the range. Therefore, the only valid solution is $\lambda = 2$.

The problem involves finding the value of $\theta$ given a trigonometric expression for $\tan \theta$. The expression involves various trigonometric functions of angles $5^\circ$, $20^\circ$, $35^\circ$, and $50^\circ$. We need to simplify the expression to find $\tan \theta$ and then determine the value of $\theta$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can start by simplifying the given expression for $\tan \theta$ using trigonometric identities. The expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

We can use the product-to-sum identities and angle addition formulas to simplify the expression. Let's rewrite the expression in a more manageable form.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the angle addition formula for cosine: $\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)$. Applying this to the numerator, we get:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ
\]

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

Next, we can use the sum-to-product identity for cosine: $\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right)$. Applying this to the numerator, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator. We can use the angle addition formula for sine: $\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B)$. Applying this to the denominator, we get:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin (-15^\circ) = -\sin 15^\circ
\]
\[
\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (35^\circ - 50^\circ) = \sin (-15^\circ) = -\sin 15^\circ
\]

So, the denominator becomes:

\[
-\sin 15^\circ - \sin 15^\circ = -2 \sin 15^\circ
\]

Now, we can rewrite the expression for $\tan \theta$ as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-2 \sin 15^\circ}
\]

We can use the identity $\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x$ to rewrite $\cos 55^\circ$ as $\sin 35^\circ$. So, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-2 \sin 15^\circ}
\]

Next, we can use the identity $\sin (45^\circ - x) = \sin 45^\circ \cos x - \cos 45^\circ \sin x$ to express $\sin 35^\circ$ in terms of $\sin 15^\circ$ and $\cos 15^\circ$, but it's more straightforward to use known values and identities to simplify further.

We can use the known values of $\sin 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}$ and $\sin 35^\circ = \cos 55^\circ$, but we need to find a direct relation or simplification.

Let's use the identity $\tan (A - B) = \frac{\tan A - \tan B}{1 + \tan A \tan B}$ to see if we can match our expression to a known angle.

However, we can directly find the value of $\theta$ by recognizing that the expression $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 15^\circ}$ matches the tangent of a specific angle.

We know that $\tan 105^\circ = -2 - \sqrt{3}$ and $\tan 15^\circ = 2 - \sqrt{3}$, but we need to find the angle whose tangent is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 15^\circ}$.

After re-evaluating the expression, we can see that:

\[
\tan \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sin 35^\circ}{\sin 15^\circ} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\cos 55^\circ}{\sin 15^\circ}
\]

We can use the known values and identities to find that $\theta = 105^\circ$.

The problem asks us to find the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE"".

The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 7 letters: E, L, L, I, P, S, E.
We need to calculate the number of distinct permutations of these letters, taking into account that some letters are repeated.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the number of distinct permutations, we use the formula for permutations of a multiset:
\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]
where \(n\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- Total number of letters, \(n = 7\)
- Frequency of E, \(n_1 = 2\)
- Frequency of L, \(n_2 = 2\)
- Frequency of I, \(n_3 = 1\)
- Frequency of P, \(n_4 = 1\)
- Frequency of S, \(n_5 = 1\)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we calculate the factorial values:
\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]
\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2

So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{5040}{2 \times 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260

The problem asks for the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of $42!$. To determine this, we need to find the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$. Since $10 = 2 \times 5$, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, we need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To count the number of times 5 is a factor, we use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$, which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For $42!$ and $p = 5$, we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

So, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \). We can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Therefore, the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) \) is \( \boxed{1} \).

To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula that the area of the triangle formed by two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors, i.e., $\frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\|$.

To find the area of triangle $OAB$, we need to calculate the cross product of $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$. The cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:

Substituting the given vectors $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, we get:

The magnitude of the cross product is:

We are given that $z$ is a complex number such that $z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. We need to find the value of $z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can start by letting $\theta$ be the argument of the complex number $z$ such that $z = re^{i\theta}$. Since $z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, we can assume that $z$ lies on the unit circle, i.e., $r = 1$. This is because the magnitude of $z + \frac{1}{z}$ is a real number, and the only way this can happen is if $z$ has a magnitude of 1.

So, we can write $z = e^{i\theta}$, and the equation becomes:
\[e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]
Using Euler's formula, we know that $e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta$. Therefore, we have:
\[2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]
This simplifies to:
\[\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.\]

Next, we need to find $z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}$. Since $z = e^{i\theta}$, we have $z^{85} = e^{i85\theta}$ and $\frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta}$. Therefore:
\[z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta).\]

To find $\cos(85\theta)$, we need to determine the value of $\theta$. We know that $\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}$, which is the cosine of a specific angle. We can use the fact that $\cos\theta = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)$, since $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}$.

Therefore, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{5}$ or $\theta = -\frac{\pi}{5}$. We can now find $85\theta$:
\[85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{\pi}{5} = 17\pi.\]
Since $\cos(17\pi) = \cos(\pi) = -1$, we have:
\[z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2\cos(17\pi) = 2(-1) = -2.\]

We are given a triangle $ABC$ with medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ intersecting at the centroid $G$. We need to find the area of triangle $ENG$ given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144.

[ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. We also know that the area of a triangle formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of a triangle is one-fourth the area of the original triangle. Additionally, since $M$ and $N$ are the points where the line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, triangle $AMN$ is similar to triangle $ABC$ and its area is one-fourth of the area of triangle $ABC$.

The area of triangle $ABC$ is given as 144. Therefore, the area of triangle $AMN$ is $\frac{1}{4} \times 144 = 36$.

Since $G$ is the centroid, it divides the median $BE$ into a ratio of 2:1. This means that the area of triangle $BGE$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $BGC$, and the area of triangle $BGC$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$. Therefore, the area of triangle $BGE$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 144 = 24$.

Now, we need to find the area of triangle $ENG$. Since $M$ and $N$ are the points where the line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, triangle $ENG$ is similar to triangle $BGE$ and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since $MN$ is parallel to $BC$ and $G$ is the centroid, the ratio of the corresponding sides of triangle $ENG$ to triangle $BGE$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \times 24 = \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6$.

Thus, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\boxed{6}$.

The problem involves finding the sixth term of an arithmetic sequence given the fourth and eighth terms. The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.

We are given:
- The fourth term $a_4 = 200$
- The eighth term $a_8 = 500$

We need to find the sixth term $a_6$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Using the general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we can write the equations for the fourth and eighth terms:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $a_1$:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference $d$, we can substitute it back into the equation for the fourth term to find $a_1$:
\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

With $a_1$ and $d$ known, we can find the sixth term $a_6$:
\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

The problem asks for the number of two-digit positive integers that are divisible by both 100 and 150. To solve this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 150, and then determine how many two-digit multiples of the LCM exist.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 150, we first need to find the prime factorization of each number:
- $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$
- $150 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$

The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM $(100, 150) = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 = 300$

Since 300 is a three-digit number, there are no two-digit numbers that are multiples of 300. Therefore, there are no two-digit positive integers that are divisible by both 100 and 150.

To solve this, we need to find all \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means \( 2^{24} = k^n \), and since \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, \( k \) must also be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Then we have:
\[ 2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn}. \]
This implies \( mn = 24 \). We need to find all pairs of positive integers \( (m, n) \) such that \( mn = 24 \) and \( n > 1 \).

We can list all the factors of 24 and find the corresponding pairs \( (m, n) \):

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24, \]
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24, \]
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24, \]
\[ 24 \times 1 = 24. \]
Since \( n > 1 \), we exclude the pair \( (24, 1) \). The remaining pairs are \( (1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6), (6, 4), (8, 3), (12, 2) \). These pairs correspond to the values of \( n \): 24, 12, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2.

The problem states that Hillary has 11 coins, all of which are dimes (d) and nickels (n). The total value of the coins is 75 cents. We need to find the number of nickels.

Let's denote the number of dimes as $d$ and the number of nickels as $n$. We have two equations based on the problem statement:

1. The total number of coins: $d + n = 11$
2. The total value of the coins: $10d + 5n = 75$ (since dimes are worth 10 cents and nickels are worth 5 cents)

We can solve these equations step by step.

We can start by solving the first equation for $d$: $d = 11 - n$. Now, substitute this expression for $d$ into the second equation:

$10(11 - n) + 5n = 75$

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

$110 - 10n + 5n = 75$
$110 - 5n = 75$
$-5n = 75 - 110$
$-5n = -35$
$n = \frac{-35}{-5}$
$n = 7$

The problem involves Pal and Jesse selecting one prime number each from the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We need to find the sum of the two selected prime numbers that are equal.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Since Pal and Jesse select one prime number each, and their selected numbers must be equal, we need to find a prime number that can be selected by both Pal and Jesse. However, since the problem states that they select the numbers in a ""random"" manner, we assume that each prime number has an equal probability of being selected.

To find the sum of the two selected prime numbers that are equal, we need to consider the possible equal selections. The only way for the sum to be equal is if they select the same prime number. Therefore, we need to find the sum of each prime number with itself.

The possible equal selections and their sums are:
- 2 + 2 = 4
- 3 + 3 = 6
- 5 + 5 = 10
- 7 + 7 = 14
- 11 + 11 = 22

Next, we need to find the smallest factor of 450 that consists only of the digits 1 and 0. We can start by checking the smallest possible numbers that meet this criterion.

The smallest numbers consisting of the digits 1 and 0 are 1, 10, 11, 100, etc. We need to check which of these numbers is a factor of 450.

We can start by checking the divisibility of these numbers with 450.

[ADVANCE]

Let's check the divisibility of the smallest numbers consisting of the digits 1 and 0:

- 1 is a factor of every number, including 450.
- 10 is a factor of 450 because \( 450 \div 10 = 45 \), which is an integer.
- 11 is not a factor of 450 because \( 450 \div 11 \) is not an integer.
- 100 is a factor of 450 because \( 450 \div 100 = 4.5 \), which is not an integer, but we can check the next number.
- 1000 is not necessary to check because 10 is already a factor and it's the smallest.

Since 10 is the smallest factor of 450 that consists only of the digits 1 and 0, we can conclude that the answer is 10.

The first number can be any of the numbers from 1 to 64, and when divided by 4, it can leave remainders of 0, 1, 2, or 3. The second number can also be any of the numbers from 1 to 64, and when divided by 5, it can leave remainders of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since each number from 1 to 64 is equally likely to be chosen, the remainders of the first number when divided by 4 are uniformly distributed among 0, 1, 2, and 3, and the remainders of the second number when divided by 5 are uniformly distributed among 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

We need to find the probability that the chess piece lands on a specific square, which means we need to find the probability of a specific combination of remainders.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.

The total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of possible remainders for the first number and the number of possible remainders for the second number, which is $4 \times 5 = 20$.

Since each remainder is equally likely, the probability of any specific combination of remainders is $\frac{1}{20}$.

First, we need to simplify the denominator by expressing it in a form that helps us convert the fraction into a decimal. Notice that $5^7 \cdot 2^8$ can be rewritten as $5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000$. So, the fraction becomes $\frac{4321}{20000000}$.

Next, we can convert this fraction into a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator.

[ADVANCE]

To convert the fraction $\frac{4321}{20000000}$ into a decimal, we perform the division:

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation $0.00021605$. We will ignore the decimal point and sum the digits of the number $00021605$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to rewrite the expression in terms of sines of angles less than or equal to $90^\circ$. This gives us:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 \sin 80^\circ.
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Substituting this value, we get:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \sin 80^\circ = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \sin 80^\circ.
\]
Next, we can use the identity $\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)$ to rewrite $\sin 80^\circ$ as $\cos 10^\circ$. However, we will use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x - y) - \cos (x + y)].
\]
We will apply this identity to simplify the product. First, we can pair the terms:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ) (\sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ) (\sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ).
\]
Using the identity, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ = \frac{1}{2} (\cos 20^\circ - \cos 60^\circ),
\]
\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{2} (\cos 20^\circ - \cos 140^\circ),
\]
\[
\sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \frac{1}{2} (\cos 20^\circ - \cos 220^\circ),
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{1}{2} (\cos 20^\circ - \cos 300^\circ).
\]
We can simplify further using the values of cosine:
\[
\cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \cos 140^\circ = -\cos 40^\circ, \quad \cos 220^\circ = -\cos 40^\circ, \quad \cos 300^\circ = \cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Substituting these values, we can simplify the product.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can now calculate the product:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{1}{16} (\cos 20^\circ - \frac{1}{2})(\cos 20^\circ + \cos 40^\circ)(\cos 20^\circ + \cos 40^\circ)(\cos 20^\circ - \frac{1}{2}).
\]
This can be simplified to:
\[
\frac{1}{16} (\cos 20^\circ - \frac{1}{2})^2 (\cos 20^\circ + \cos 40^\circ)^2.
\]
We can use the identity $\cos 20^\circ + \cos 40^\circ = 2 \cos 30^\circ \cos 10^\circ = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 10^\circ = \sqrt{3} \cos 10^\circ$.
Substituting this value, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{16} (\cos 20^\circ - \frac{1}{2})^2 ( \sqrt{3} \cos 10^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{16} (\cos 20^\circ - \frac{1}{2})^2 \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity $\cos 3x = 4 \cos^3 x - 3 \cos x$ to find the value of $\cos 20^\circ$ in terms of $\cos 60^\circ$.
Since $\cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2} = 4 \cos^3 20^\circ - 3 \cos 20^\circ$, we can solve for $\cos 20^\circ$.
However, we can use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) \sin 3x = \frac{1}{16} \sin 4x.
\]
Applying this identity for $x = 20^\circ$, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{16} \sin 80^\circ.
\]
Since $\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ$, we can use the identity for the product of sines again.
We can simplify the expression:
\[

\]
Using the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$, we can rewrite the expression:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{16} \sin 80^\circ\right) \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{16} (\sin 80^\circ)^2 \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity $\sin 3x = 3 \sin x - 4 \sin^3 x$ to find the value of $\sin 20^\circ, \sin 40^\circ, \sin 60^\circ, \sin 80^\circ$.
However, we can use the known result:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) \sin 3x = \frac{1}{16} \sin 4x.
\]
Applying this identity for $x = 20^\circ$, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{16} \sin 80^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{16} (\sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{16} \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{256} (\sin 80^\circ)^3.
\]
We can use the identity $\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x$ to rewrite $\sin 80^\circ$ as $\cos 10^\circ$.
However, we can use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression again.
The final value of the product is:

The problem involves identifying the geometric shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) represents the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis, \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane measured from the positive \(x\)-axis, and \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height \(z\) is constant and does not depend on \(r\) or \(\theta\). This means that for any value of \(r\) and \(\theta\), the \(z\)-coordinate remains the same.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Given that \(z\) is constant and does not vary with \(r\) or \(\theta\), the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane. This is because the height above the \(xy\)-plane is the same for all points, regardless of their radial distance \(r\) or angular coordinate \(\theta\).

Therefore, the geometric shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane.

We are also given the cross product of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ as $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$. We need to find the smallest possible angle between vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.

We are given a function $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ and another function $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the derivative of $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the derivative of $g(x)$, we can use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if $g(x) = f(u(x))$, then $g'(x) = f'(u(x)) \cdot u'(x)$. In this case, $u(x) = x + 5$, so $u'(x) = 1$.

First, we need to find the derivative of $f(x)$. The derivative of $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ is:
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 98x + 623. \]

Now, we can find the derivative of $g(x)$ using the chain rule:
\[ g'(x) = f'(x + 5) \cdot 1 = f'(x + 5). \]

Substituting $x + 5$ into $f'(x)$, we get:
\[ g'(x) = 3(x + 5)^2 - 98(x + 5) + 623. \]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to simplify the expression for $g'(x)$:
\[ g'(x) = 3(x^2 + 10x + 25) - 98x - 490 + 623. \]
\[ g'(x) = 3x^2 + 30x + 75 - 98x + 133. \]
\[ g'(x) = 3x^2 - 68x + 208. \]

So, the derivative of $g(x)$ is $g'(x) = 3x^2 - 68x + 208$.

The problem requires us to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

The expression becomes \(\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ\).

We can use the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\) to further simplify the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression using the identities \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\):

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to proceed. We can use the fact that \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to relate these terms.

Next, we can use the identity \(\tan (3x) = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\) to find a relationship between \(\tan 10^\circ\), \(\tan 20^\circ\), and \(\tan 30^\circ\).

Since \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), we can set up the equation:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

This equation is complex to solve directly, so let's use another approach to find the value of the expression.

We can use the identity \(\cot 2x = \frac{1 - \tan^2 x}{2\tan x}\) to express \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 10^\circ\).

However, a more efficient approach is to use the known result for this type of trigonometric expression. We can use the identity:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 3x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (90^\circ - 2x)} = 10
\]

for \(x = 10^\circ\), which gives us the value of the expression.

The problem involves finding the number of sides in a polygon given the sum of its interior angles except one. We know that the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ$. If we denote the unknown interior angle as $x$, then the sum of all interior angles is $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x$. We need to find the value of $n$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can set up the equation based on the sum of the interior angles of the polygon:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
\]
Since $x$ is an interior angle of the polygon, it must be less than $180^\circ$. We can express $x$ as:
\[
x = (n-2) \cdot 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
\]
Given that $x < 180^\circ$, we can set up the inequality:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
\]
Simplifying the inequality, we get:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
\]
\[
n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]
\[
n-2 < 6.9444
\]
\[
n < 8.9444
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, the possible values for $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. However, we also know that the sum of the interior angles must be an integer multiple of $180^\circ$, so we need to check which of these values satisfies the equation $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x$ where $x$ is an integer less than $180^\circ$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can test the possible values of $n$ to find the correct one. Let's start with $n = 8$:
\[
(8-2) \cdot 180^\circ = 6 \cdot 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
\]
\[
1080^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
\]
\[
x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
\]
Since $x = 10^\circ$ is a valid interior angle (less than $180^\circ$), $n = 8$ is a possible solution.

The problem requires finding the number of sides in a polygon given the sum of its interior angles except one.

The problem states that \(0 < t < 23\) and \(t + 2\) is a multiple of the constant \(23\). We need to find a unique odd integer \(t\) that satisfies these conditions.

[ADVANCE]

Since \(t + 2\) is a multiple of 23, we can write the equation as \(t + 2 = 23k\), where \(k\) is an integer. Rearranging the equation, we get \(t = 23k - 2\).

Given the constraint \(0 < t < 23\), we can substitute the expression for \(t\) into this inequality:
\[0 < 23k - 2 < 23.\]

We can split this inequality into two parts:
\[0 < 23k - 2 \quad \text{and} \quad 23k - 2 < 23.\]

Solving the first part:
\[0 < 23k - 2 \implies 2 < 23k \implies \frac{2}{23} < k \implies k > \frac{2}{23}.\]
Since \(k\) is an integer, the smallest possible value for \(k\) is 1.

Solving the second part:
\[23k - 2 < 23 \implies 23k < 25 \implies k < \frac{25}{23}.\]
Since \(k\) is an integer, the largest possible value for \(k\) is 1.

Therefore, the only possible value for \(k\) is 1. Substituting \(k = 1\) into the equation \(t = 23k - 2\), we get:
\[t = 23 \cdot 1 - 2 = 21.\]

[VERIFY]

We need to verify that \(t = 21\) is an odd integer and satisfies the original conditions. Since 21 is indeed an odd integer and \(0 < 21 < 23\), it meets the given constraints.

Additionally, we check if \(t + 2\) is a multiple of 23:
\[t + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23,\]
which is indeed a multiple of 23.

Therefore, the solution is valid.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is \(\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) and the range of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is \((0, \pi)\), we can simplify the expression inside the sine function.

For \(x > 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

For \(x < 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

However, we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x\), so:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have a contradiction unless the argument of the sine function is not exactly \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). However, we need to consider the case when \(x < 0\).

We need to find the value of \(x\) such that:
\[
\sin \left( \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (\pi + \theta) = -\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
-\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = -\frac{1}{3}.
\]
We know that \(\sin (2\theta) = \frac{2\tan \theta}{1 + \tan^2 \theta}\), so:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = -\frac{1}{3}.

Solving for \(x\), we get:

and the second line is given by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.\]
Since the lines are parallel, their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. We can see that the direction vector of the second line is twice the direction vector of the first line:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
This confirms that the lines are parallel.

[ADVANCE]

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},\]
where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we need to find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Next, we need to find the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.\]
Calculating the determinant, we get:
\[\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8))\]
\[= \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72)\]
\[= \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58)\]
\[= \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Now, we need to find the magnitude of this cross product:
\[\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.\]

We also need to find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):

We are given three vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, and we need to find the value of $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$. We have the cross products of these vectors:
\[\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$, we can use the distributive property of the cross product:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.\]
Using the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, we get:
\[= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}).\]
Since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, the equation simplifies to:
\[= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).\]
We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so we can substitute this in:
\[= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})\]
\[= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})\]
Now, we can substitute the given values of the cross products:
\[= 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
Next, we perform the scalar multiplications:

Now, we perform the vector subtractions:

We are given a square $ABCD$ with $\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}$, and $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$. The diagonal $\overline{AC}$ bisects the angle $\angle BAD$. The area of the square $[ABCD]$ is given as 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $ABCD$ is a square, let the side length of the square be $s$. The area of the square is given by $s^2 = 42$. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the diagonal of the square, its length is $s\sqrt{2}$. The area of $\triangle ACD$ can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. Here, the base is $s$ and the height is also $s$ because $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle with legs of length $s$.

So, the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times s \times s = \frac{1}{2} s^2$. Since we know that $s^2 = 42$, we can substitute this value into the area formula.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting $s^2 = 42$ into the area formula, we get:

The problem is to solve the equation $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$ for $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To solve the equation, we can start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots. This gives us:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]
Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]
Next, we can cross-multiply to clear the fractions:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Rearranging the terms to isolate $x$, we get:
\[
9 = 27x - 8x
\]
\[
9 = 19x
\]
Solving for $x$, we find:
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Next action: [VERIFY]

We need to verify that the solution $x = \frac{9}{19}$ satisfies the original equation and that the steps taken are valid. We also need to ensure that the solution is within the domain of the original equation, which means $3x-1 > 0$ (since the denominator cannot be zero or negative).

Checking the domain:
\[
3x - 1 > 0 \implies 3\left(\frac{9}{19}\right) - 1 > 0 \implies \frac{27}{19} - 1 > 0 \implies \frac{27-19}{19} > 0 \implies \frac{8}{19} > 0
\]
This is true, so $x = \frac{9}{19}$ is within the domain of the original equation.

Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{9}{19}$ back into the original equation to verify the solution:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
This confirms that $x = \frac{9}{19}$ is indeed the solution to the equation.

The problem involves selecting 4 points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ on a circle in a random and distinct manner. We need to find the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of circular permutations and combinatorics. When we select 4 points on a circle, there are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to form two chords. However, only 2 out of these 6 ways result in intersecting chords. This is because the chords $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating manner, i.e., $A$, $C$, $B$, $D$ or $A$, $D$, $B$, $C$.

[ADVANCE]

The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is $(4-1)! = 3! = 6$. For each arrangement, there is only one way to pair the points such that the chords intersect. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 3 (since there are 3 ways to choose which point is between the other two in an alternating arrangement).

However, a simpler approach is to note that out of the 3 ways to choose which chord is ""above"" the other, exactly 1 of these ways results in intersecting chords. This means that the probability of the chords intersecting is $\frac{1}{3}$.

The probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the angle sum and difference identities for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha

We also know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we can substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}

\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{25} = \frac{5\sqrt{21} - 4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}

Next, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})\sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2\sqrt{63} + 21}{500} = \frac{2 \cdot 3\sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{6\sqrt{7} + 21}{500}
\]

However, we can simplify this problem using the product-to-sum identities. We know that:
\[
\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) - \cos (A + B)]
\]
Let \(A = \alpha + \beta\) and \(B = \beta - \alpha\), then:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos ((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha)) - \cos ((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha))] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2\alpha) - \cos (2\beta)]
\]
We also know that \(\cos (2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\), so:
\[
\cos (2\alpha) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

\[
\cos (2\beta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Thus:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.18 = 0.09

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 members without any restrictions. Then, we subtract the number of ways to choose 5 members that are all students or all teachers.

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of members and $k$ is the number of members to choose.

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 members is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members that are all students. Since there are 8 students, the number of ways to choose 5 students from 8 students is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

We also calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members that are all teachers. Since there are 6 teachers, the number of ways to choose 5 teachers from 6 teachers is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The problem requires finding the value of the expression \(513^2 - 487^2\). This is a difference of squares, which can be factored as \((a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)\).

[ADVANCE]

We can apply the difference of squares formula to the given expression:
\[513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487)\]

Now, we calculate the values inside the parentheses:
\[513 - 487 = 26\]
\[513 + 487 = 1000\]

So, the expression simplifies to:

The problem involves finding three consecutive integers whose product is 120. Additionally, when the product is divided by the average of these three integers, the result is 24. We need to identify the three consecutive integers and determine the largest among them.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). According to the problem, their product is 120:
\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]
We also know that the product divided by the average of these three integers is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{\frac{(n-1)+n+(n+1)}{3}} = 24
\]
Simplifying the average, we get:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{\frac{3n}{3}} = \frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = (n-1)(n+1) = n^2 - 1 = 24
\]
So, we have the equation:
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]
Solving for \(n\), we get:
\[
n^2 = 25 \implies n = \pm 5
\]
Since we are looking for consecutive integers, we can consider both positive and negative values of \(n\). However, the product of the integers should be 120, which is positive. Therefore, we can test both \(n = 5\) and \(n = -5\) to find the correct set of consecutive integers.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's test \(n = 5\):
The three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\). Their product is:
\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]
This matches the given product. Now, let's check the average:
\[
\frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = 5
\]
Dividing the product by the average, we get:
\[
\frac{120}{5} = 24
\]
This matches the given condition. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are indeed \(4, 5, 6\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The given equation is $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$. To eliminate the cube root, we can cube both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
We can rewrite the left side of the equation as a perfect square:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since $\sqrt{4096} = 64$, we have:
\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]
Solving for $x$, we get:
\[
x = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -62

We can use trigonometric identities and properties of cosine to simplify this expression.

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

The problem states that the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is $3^7$. We need to find the middle term of these integers.

Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$ and the common difference as 1. The sequence of consecutive integers can be written as $a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) \(\times\) (average of the first and last term). For 27 consecutive integers, the sum can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Sum} = 27 \times \left(\frac{a + (a+26)}{2}\right) = 27 \times (a + 13) \]

According to the problem, the sum is equal to $3^7 = 2187$. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 27 \times (a + 13) = 2187 \]

We can solve for $a$:
\[ a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81 \]
\[ a = 81 - 13 = 68 \]

The middle term of the 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term (since the sequence is odd-numbered), which is:
\[ a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81 \]

So, the middle term is $\boxed{81}$.

The problem requires finding the values of $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds true. We need to break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factorize the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true.

The roots of the equation $(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0$ are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we know that $y \geq 0$. Therefore, we only consider the interval where $y$ is non-negative. The inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ holds true when $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we have $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which gives us $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factorized as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2$ is always non-negative and greater than 0 for all real values of $x$ (except when $x^2 + 2 = 0$, which has no real solutions), the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$ holds true for all real values of $x$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. The solution to the first inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, and the solution to the second inequality is all real values of $x$. Therefore, the intersection of these solutions is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $x + y + z$ as $p$ and $xy + yz + zx$ as $q$. Then we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = p^2 - 2q.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = p(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - q)$, we get
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 2q - q) = p(p^2 - 3q).\]
So, we have the equation
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relationship between $p$ and $q$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We are given the equation
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor the left-hand side as
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
This can be rewritten as
\[xy(p - z) + xz(p - y) + yz(p - x) = 12,\]
where $p = x + y + z$. Expanding the left-hand side, we get
\[p(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $q = xy + yz + zx$ and $xyz = 4$, we have
\[pq - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[pq - 12 = 12,\]
so
\[pq = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q)\]
and
\[pq = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $q$:
\[q = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = p\left(p^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{p}\right) = p\left(p^2 - \frac{72}{p}\right) = p^3 - 72.\]
So, we have the equation
\[p^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which simplifies to
\[p^3 = 64.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[p = 4.\]
Now, substituting $p = 4$ into the equation $pq = 24$, we find
\[4q = 24,\]
so
\[q = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $\boxed{6}$.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of boys and girls willing to take the bus trip for each class, and then find the class where the number of boys is closest to $135\%$ of the number of girls.

Let's denote the number of boys and girls in each class as 300. For each class, we can calculate the number of boys and girls willing to take the bus trip as follows:

- For the $9^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: boys = $41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3$, girls = $39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2$
- For the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: boys = $34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2$, girls = $33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3$
- For the $11^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: boys = $20.6\% \times 300 = 61.8$, girls = $13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4$
- For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: boys = $11.6\% \times 300 = 34.8$, girls = $8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8$

Next, we need to calculate $135\%$ of the number of girls for each class and compare it with the number of boys:

- For the $9^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: $135\% \times 118.2 = 1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.47$, difference = $123.3 - 159.47 = -36.17$
- For the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: $135\% \times 99.3 = 1.35 \times 99.3 = 134.055$, difference = $103.2 - 134.055 = -30.855$
- For the $11^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: $135\% \times 41.4 = 1.35 \times 41.4 = 56.31$, difference = $61.8 - 56.31 = 5.49$
- For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: $135\% \times 25.8 = 1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.83$, difference = $34.8 - 34.83 = -0.03$

The smallest difference is in the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ class, where the number of boys willing to take the bus trip is closest to $135\%$ of the number of girls willing to take the bus trip.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator can be written as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\), and the denominator can be factored as \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\).

The inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator \(x(x-36)\) and the points where the expression inside the absolute value is zero, i.e., \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

However, we must exclude the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, i.e., \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), because the expression is undefined at these points.

[ADVANCE]

To solve the inequality, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9, 0, 9, 36\).

Let's analyze the sign of the expression in each interval:

1. For \(x < -9\), all factors \(x\), \(x-36\), and \(x-9\) are negative, so the denominator is positive. The absolute value \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive. Therefore, the fraction is positive.
2. For \(-9 < x < 0\), the factor \(x+9\) is positive, and \(x\), \(x-36\), and \(x-9\) are negative, so the denominator is positive. The absolute value \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive. Therefore, the fraction is positive.
3. For \(0 < x < 9\), the factor \(x\) is positive, and \(x-36\) and \(x-9\) are negative, so the denominator is negative. The absolute value \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive. Therefore, the fraction is negative.
4. For \(9 < x < 36\), the factors \(x\) and \(x-9\) are positive, and \(x-36\) is negative, so the denominator is negative. The absolute value \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive. Therefore, the fraction is negative.
5. For \(x > 36\), all factors \(x\), \(x-9\), and \(x-36\) are positive, so the denominator is positive. The absolute value \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is positive. Therefore, the fraction is positive.

From the analysis, the fraction is negative in the intervals \(0 < x < 9\) and \(9 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude \(x = 9\) because it makes the expression inside the absolute value zero, but it does not affect the sign of the fraction.

# Let's denote the length of the rectangle by $L$ and the width by $W$. The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles.
# The perimeter of the track can be expressed as $2L + 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = 2L + \pi W = 400$.
# We can solve this equation for $L$ in terms of $W$: $L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}$.
# The area of the rectangular field is given by $A = L \times W = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right)W = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}$.
# To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of the area with respect to $W$, set it to zero, and solve for $W$.
# The derivative of the area with respect to $W$ is $\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W$.
# Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us $200 - \pi W = 0$, so $W = \frac{200}{\pi}$.
# Now, we can find the corresponding value of $L$ by substituting $W$ into the equation $L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}$: $L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right) = 200 - 100 = 100$.

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ has length 2 and the hypotenuse has length 5.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this length as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, $\sin T = \frac{\text{opposite side to } T}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{s}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The problem involves finding the minimum distance between a point on the curve $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ and the origin. The distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. Here, the distance between the point $(x, y)$ on the curve and the origin $(0, 0)$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

Since $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the distance formula to get the distance as a function of $x$:
\[ D(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2-3)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}. \]

To find the minimum distance, we need to find the critical points of $D(x)$ by taking the derivative of $D(x)$ with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero. However, it's easier to work with the square of the distance, $D^2(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$, because the minimum of $D(x)$ will occur at the same point as the minimum of $D^2(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's find the derivative of $D^2(x)$ with respect to $x$:
\[ \frac{d}{dx}D^2(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\right) = 2x^3 - 4x. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:
\[ 2x^3 - 4x = 0. \]
Factoring out $2x$:
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0. \]
This gives us the critical points:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}. \]

Next, we need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimum distance. We can do this by evaluating the second derivative of $D^2(x)$:
\[ \frac{d^2}{dx^2}D^2(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(2x^3 - 4x) = 6x^2 - 4. \]
Evaluating the second derivative at the critical points:
\[ \text{At } x = 0: \quad 6(0)^2 - 4 = -4 < 0, \]
so $x = 0$ is a local maximum.
\[ \text{At } x = \pm \sqrt{2}: \quad 6(\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 > 0, \]
so $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$ are local minima.

Since we are looking for the minimum distance, we evaluate $D(x)$ at $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
The distance is:
\[ D(\sqrt{2}) = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}. \]

The minimum distance is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$, so $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

The final answer is:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, let's solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \), but neither of these satisfies the condition \( x > 3 \), so there are no valid solutions from this part of the piecewise function.

Therefore, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation, but since we already found a valid solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) in the region \( x \leq 3 \), we can proceed with the valid solution \( x = -3 \).

Therefore, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Next, we can find the sum \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octagon, given the distances from $P$ to the first five vertices. We need to use geometric properties and theorems to solve this problem.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular polygon to its vertices is constant and can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2 = n \left( R^2 + OP^2 \right), \]
where $d_i$ are the distances from the point to the vertices, $R$ is the circumradius of the polygon, $O$ is the center of the polygon, and $P$ is the point inside the polygon.

For a regular octagon, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to its vertices is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 8 \left( R^2 + OP^2 \right), \]
where $x$ is the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex.

We also know that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octagon to its vertices is:
\[ 8R^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2. \]

Since the octagon is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices minus $8OP^2$. However, we can simplify the problem by using the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular polygon is constant.

Let's calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324. \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octagon is constant, we can set up the equation:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 8R^2 + 8OP^2. \]

We also know that:
\[ 8R^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2. \]

By substituting the value of the sum of the squares of the given distances, we get:
\[ 8R^2 = 324 + x^2. \]

Now, we can substitute this expression into the previous equation:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 324 + x^2. \]

This equation is an identity, so we need to find another way to solve for $x$. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular polygon is constant and can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2 = n \left( R^2 + OP^2 \right). \]

For a regular octagon, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to its vertices is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 8 \left( R^2 + OP^2 \right). \]

We can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octagon to its vertices is:
\[ 8R^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2. \]

By substituting the value of the sum of the squares of the given distances, we get:
\[ 8R^2 = 324 + x^2. \]

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octagon is constant:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + 4^2. \]

Therefore, we can conclude that:
\[ x = 4. \]

The problem involves comparing the stretch lengths of a spring when different forces are applied to it. We are given the spring constants (kuvayal) of the two springs, and we need to find the ratio of the stretch lengths of the springs when the same force is applied to both.

The formula for the stretch length of a spring is given by Hooke's Law: $F = kx$, where $F$ is the force applied, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the stretch length.

Given:
- The spring constant of the shortbault is $k_{shortbault} = 200$ g.
- The spring constant of the longbault is $k_{longbault} = 150$ g.
- The same force $F$ is applied to both springs.

We need to find the ratio of the stretch lengths of the shortbault to the longbault.

\[ x_{longbault} = \frac{F}{k_{longbault}} = \frac{F}{150} \]

The ratio of the stretch lengths of the shortbault to the longbault is:
\[ \frac{x_{shortbault}}{x_{longbault}} = \frac{\frac{F}{200}}{\frac{F}{150}} = \frac{F}{200} \times \frac{150}{F} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

To convert a decimal number to another base, we repeatedly divide the number by the base and keep track of the remainders.

\[

\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of $629_{10}$ as $1556_7$.

Next, let's convert $629_{10}$ to base 8.

\[

[ADVANCE]

First, we use Vieta's formulas for the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. Vieta's formulas tell us that for a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k = 0$, the sum of the roots taken one at a time is $-\frac{b}{a}$, the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is $\frac{c}{a}$, and so on.

For the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$, we have:

\[

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.
\]

We need to find the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. Let's denote these expressions as $a, b, c$ respectively. We know that:
\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the product of these expressions. We have:
\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product, we get:
\[
abc = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]

Using the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2$ and $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2$, we get:
\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2(-2)(-2)
\]
\[
= (-2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^2 + 8
\]
\[
= 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 24.
\]

Since $a + b + c = 0$ and $abc = 24$, the expressions $a, b, c$ are the roots of the polynomial $t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0$, which simplifies to $t^3 - 24 = 0$. Therefore, the roots are $\sqrt[3]{24}, \sqrt[3]{24}\omega, \sqrt[3]{24}\omega^2$, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

However, we can simplify this further by noting that the expressions are symmetric and the polynomial is symmetric, so the values must be the same when permuted. Therefore, the set of values is $\{-2, -2, -2\}$.

Thus, the final answer is:

To convert $\frac{137}{500}$ into a decimal, we can perform the division $137 \div 500$. However, to make the calculation easier, we can also express $\frac{137}{500}$ in a form that makes it simpler to convert to a decimal by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by a power of 2 or 5 to eliminate the denominator's factors other than 2 and 5.

Since $500 = 2^2 \times 5^3$, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $2$ to make the denominator a power of 10.

$\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000} = 0.274$

Now, we need to identify the last non-zero digit in the decimal expansion $0.274$. The last non-zero digit is $4$.

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) for three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if }n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right.\]
We need to determine the value of each expression and then sum them up.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
\[ \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472. \]
Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
\[ \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708. \]
Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
\[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
\[ 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4. \]
Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
\[ f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

Now, we sum up the values:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

The problem involves calculating the total amount of money the five individuals have after buying pizza slices and then converting the total amount into dollars.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money the five individuals have after buying the pizza slices. We add up the amounts each person spent:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]
So, the total amount of money they have is $126.59.

Next, we need to convert this total amount into dollars and cents. Since the amount is already in dollars and cents, we can directly find the number of cents by taking the fractional part of the amount and multiplying it by 100:
\[
0.59 \times 100 = 59 \text{ cents}
\]
The integer part of the amount is the number of dollars:
\[
126 \text{ dollars}
\]
The remainder when the total amount is divided by 1 dollar is the number of cents:
\[
59 \text{ cents}
\]
Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we can convert the remaining cents into dollars and cents:
\[
59 \text{ cents} = 0 \text{ dollars and } 59 \text{ cents}
\]
So, the remaining amount after converting to dollars is:
\[
126 \text{ dollars and } 59 \text{ cents}
\]
The number of cents remaining is 59 cents, which is less than 100 cents, so we can't convert it further into dollars. The remaining amount in cents is 59 cents.

The problem requires finding the average score of a class of 30 students, where the scores are distributed as follows: 20 students scored 80 marks, 8 students scored 90 marks, and 2 students scored 100 marks.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the average score, we need to calculate the total score of all students and then divide it by the total number of students. The total score can be calculated by multiplying the number of students in each score group by the corresponding score and then summing these products.

The total score is:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ \text{Total score} = 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

The average score is the total score divided by the total number of students:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, let's calculate the average score:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

We are given that $\omega$ is a complex number such that $\omega^3 = 1$. We need to find the possible values of $\omega$ and then evaluate the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$ for these values.

[ADVANCE]

The equation $\omega^3 = 1$ has three solutions, which are the cube roots of unity. These solutions are $1$, $\omega = e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and $\omega^2 = e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Note that $\omega \neq 1$ because if $\omega = 1$, the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$ would be undefined.

So, the possible values of $\omega$ are $\omega = e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to evaluate the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$ for $\omega = e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

First, let's consider $\omega = e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Then, $\omega^2 = e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

We have:
\[
1 + \omega = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
and
\[
1 + \omega^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we can find the reciprocals:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1} = \frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1} = \frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Adding these two expressions together, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \left(\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]

Since the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$ is symmetric in $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, the value will be the same for $\omega = e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Therefore, the value of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$ is $\boxed{1}$.
