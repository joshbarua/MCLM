We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can substitute the given value of $\sin D$ and the length of $EF$ to find the length of $DF$. We have:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($DF$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($DE$ and $EF$). Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Solving for $DE^2$, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

The value of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given a complex number $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and another complex number $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in the counterclockwise direction, denoted as $w$.

To solve this, we can use the concept of complex number rotation. The rotation of a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$ can be achieved by the formula:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]
where $e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$. For a rotation of $\frac{\pi}{4}$, we have $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to calculate $z - c$ first:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} + (-3 - 3 \sqrt{2} + 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \]

Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) - 3 \sqrt{2} i \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = (1 + i) - 3i (1 + i) \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 \]
\[ = 1 - 2i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Finally, we add $c$ to the result to get $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

The problem requires simplifying the square root of 242. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

[OUTPUT]

The problem involves arranging 8 people around a round table, with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We need to account for the circular permutation and the fact that the arrangement of the 3 people who must sit together can be permuted among themselves.

[ADVANCE]

1. Treat the 3 people who must sit together (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) as a single ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the 5 individual people plus the 1 block of 3 people) around a round table.
2. The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""blocks"" around the round table is $(6-1)! = 5!$.
3. Within the ""block"" of 3 people, there are $3!$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas among themselves.
4. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the round table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is $5! \times 3!$.

[ADVANCE]

1. Calculate $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.
2. Calculate $3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$.
3. Multiply the results: $120 \times 6 = 720$.

The problem asks for the term constant in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). So, the general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\).

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is zero. The exponent of \(x\) in the general term is \(3(5-k) - 2k = 15 - 5k\). Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3.\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term:
\[\binom{5}{3}(10x^3)^{2}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3}(10)^2(x^3)^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3(x^2)^{-3} = \binom{5}{3}(100)x^6\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)x^{-6} = \binom{5}{3}(100)\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125.\]

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

Substituting $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we get:
\[ n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

So, we need to find the product:

The problem asks for the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise around its center to coincide with its original position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides of equal length and 5 equal interior angles. The total sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is $(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ$, and each interior angle of a regular pentagon is $\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ$.

The rotation symmetry of a regular pentagon is of order 5, meaning it returns to its original position after a rotation of $\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is the angle of rotation that corresponds to its symmetry. Since the pentagon has 5-fold rotational symmetry, the minimum rotation angle is $\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ$.

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram given the coordinates of the other three vertices. The coordinates of the vertices are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y) with the condition that $x > 7$. We need to find the value of $x + y$.

[ADVANCE]

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
Now, let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and (x, y):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 6$ is not a valid solution. Let's consider the other pair of vertices to form the diagonals.

We can also calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
Now, let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (7, 4) and (x, y):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 4$ is not a valid solution. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's consider the vector approach. The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and (x, y). The vector from (5, 3) to (7, 4) is (2, 1). This vector is the same as the vector from (6, 8) to (x, y). Therefore, we can write:
\[
(x, y) = (6, 8) + (2, 1) = (8, 9)
\]
Since $x = 8 > 7$, this solution is valid. Now, we can find $x + y$:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

We are given a right triangle $ABC$ with $\angle B = 90^\circ$, and the relationship $\sin A = 2\cos A$. We need to find the value of $\tan A$.

[ADVANCE]

We know that $\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ and $\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. This simplifies to $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$.

We also know that $\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$. Using the relationship we found, we can substitute $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$ into the expression for $\tan A$.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$ into the expression for $\tan A$, we get:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{2 \cdot \text{adjacent}}{\text{adjacent}} = 2.

The problem involves finding the asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and then calculating the sum of the values of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression to find its roots.

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

Setting the factored form equal to zero, we get:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), where \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), which means \( c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the sum \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

We can start by recognizing that \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is close to the expansion of \((99+1)^2\), but we need to adjust for the extra terms. Let's rewrite the expression in a more manageable form.

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2\]

This looks similar to the formula for the sum of squares, but we can also think of it in terms of \((99+1)^2\) minus some extra terms.

[ADVANCE]

We can express \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) as \((99+1)^2 - 99\), because \((99+1)^2 = 99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 99^2 + 198 + 1\), and subtracting 99 from this gives us the original expression.

So,\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = (99+1)^2 - 99 = 100^2 - 99\]

Now, we can calculate \(100^2 - 99\) easily.

To approach this problem, we need to understand how the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) transforms a vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) and then find the relationship between the norm of the transformed vector and the norm of the original vector.

Let's denote the matrix by \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). For a vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\), the transformed vector is \( A\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \).

The norm of the transformed vector is given by:
\[
\left\| A\bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}
\]
The norm of the original vector is:
\[
\|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
We need to find the smallest \( C \) such that:
\[

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the smallest \( C \), we can use the fact that the matrix norm induced by the Euclidean norm is the largest singular value of the matrix. The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

Let's calculate \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial:
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]
Solving the quadratic equation, we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]
So, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The singular values of \( A \) are \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \) and \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \).

The largest singular value is 4, which is the matrix norm induced by the Euclidean norm. Therefore, the smallest \( C \) is 4.

To perform the subtraction, we first need to convert the numbers to a more familiar form. We can convert $58_9$ and $18_9$ to base 10.

The number $58_9$ in base 10 is calculated as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

The number $18_9$ in base 10 is calculated as:

Now, we can perform the subtraction in base 10:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

Next, we need to convert the result, $36_{10}$, back to base 9.

To convert $36_{10}$ to base 9, we divide 36 by 9 and find the quotient and remainder:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]

We start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\), since \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). The expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

We use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) to simplify the numerator:
\[

Let's denote the weight of a treek as $T$, the weight of a squig as $S$, and the weight of a goolee as $G$. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Dez treeks pesam tanto quanto três squigs e um goolee: $10T = 3S + G$
2. Dois treeks e um goolee são iguais em peso a um squig: $2T + G = S$

We can use these equations to express the weight of treeks in terms of the weight of squigs.

First, we can solve the second equation for $G$: $G = S - 2T$

Next, we substitute this expression for $G$ into the first equation: $10T = 3S + (S - 2T)$

Simplify the equation: $10T = 4S - 2T$

Combine like terms: $12T = 4S$

Solve for $T$ in terms of $S$: $T = \frac{4S}{12} = \frac{S}{3}$

This means that the weight of one treek is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the weight of a squig. To find the number of treeks that have the same weight as one squig, we can set up the equation: $xT = S$, where $x$ is the number of treeks.

Substitute $T = \frac{S}{3}$ into the equation: $x \left(\frac{S}{3}\right) = S$

Solve for $x$: $x = 3$

Therefore, the weight combinado de $\boxed{3}$ treeks é igual ao peso de um squig.

The problem involves finding the values of $a$ and $b$ by comparing the product of two polynomials with a given polynomial. We need to identify the coefficients of the resulting polynomial and match them with the given polynomial to determine $a$ and $b$.

[ADVANCE]

The product of the two polynomials is:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can set up the following equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
-2a = 6
\]

[ADVANCE]

From the equation $-2a = 6$, we can solve for $a$:
\[
a = -3
\]
Substituting $a = -3$ into the equation $-10 + ab = -16$, we get:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16
\]
\[
-10 - 3b = -16
\]
\[
-3b = -6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]
We can verify these values by substituting $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into the other equations. First, we check the equation $3b + 20 = 26$:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]
This equation holds true. Next, we check the equation $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation also holds true.

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have verified the values of $a$ and $b$, we can find the value of $a + b$:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

The problem involves a cylindrical tank being filled with water at a certain rate, and we need to find the radius of the tank given the rate at which the water level rises.

The key pieces of information are:
- The rate at which the tank is being filled with water is $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour.
- The rate at which the water level rises is 4 meters per hour.
- We need to find the radius of the cylindrical tank.

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.

Since the volume of water being added per hour is $20\pi$ cubic meters and the height of the water is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height.

[ADVANCE]

The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is given by $\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The rate at which the height of the water is increasing is given by $\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$ meters per hour.

Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, $V = \pi r^2 h$, we can differentiate both sides with respect to time $t$ to get:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Substituting the given values, we have:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
We can simplify this equation to solve for $r^2$:
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2
\]
Dividing both sides by $4\pi$, we get:
\[
r^2 = 5
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

The radius of the tank is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$ meters.

The problem involves finding the largest value of $a$ such that the graph of the piecewise function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once. To approach this, we need to analyze the function's behavior for both $x \geq a$ and $x < a$.

[ADVANCE]

For the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once, it must take on all values greater than or equal to the minimum value it attains. We need to find the minimum value of $f(x)$.

For $x \geq a$, the function is $f(x) = ax^2$, which is a parabola opening upwards. The minimum value of this part of the function occurs at $x = a$, giving us $f(a) = aa^2 = a^3$.

For $x < a$, the function is $f(x) = ax + 2a$, which is a line with slope $a$. The minimum value of this part of the function will occur as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left, so we evaluate the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left: $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$.

To ensure the function intersects every horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of the function must be less than or equal to the minimum value of the other part of the function. Therefore, we need $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$.

[ADVANCE]

We now solve the inequality $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$. Rearranging terms, we get $a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0$. Factoring out $a$, we have $a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0$, which further factors into $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$.

We need to find the intervals where this inequality holds. The roots of the equation are $a = 0$, $a = 2$, and $a = -1$. We test the sign of the expression $a(a - 2)(a + 1)$ in the intervals defined by these roots: $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(2, \infty)$.

- For $a < -1$, all three factors are negative, so the product is negative.
- For $-1 < a < 0$, $a$ is negative, but $a-2$ and $a+1$ are negative, so the product is positive.
- For $0 < a < 2$, $a$ is positive, but $a-2$ is negative, and $a+1$ is positive, so the product is negative.
- For $a > 2$, all three factors are positive, so the product is positive.

The inequality $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$ holds for $-1 \leq a \leq 0$ and $0 \leq a \leq 2$. Since $a$ cannot be negative (the function's definition and the context of the problem), we consider the interval $0 \leq a \leq 2$.

The largest value of $a$ in this interval is $2$.

The largest value of $a$ such that the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects each horizontal line at least once is $\boxed{2}$.

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1.

To solve this, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). We will complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

[ADVANCE]

1. Complete the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

2. Complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

3. Substitute the completed square terms back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation is now in standard form, where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\).

Since the radius is given as 1, we can set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1^2 \]
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

The problem involves finding the values of the constant $\lambda$ within the range $0 \leq \lambda \leq 4$ for which there exists an $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x$, where $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the given conditions, we need to analyze the equation $f(f(x)) = x$. First, we compute $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
We want $f(f(x)) = x$, so we set up the equation:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This equation must have a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$. Let's denote $y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$. Then, the equation becomes:
\[f(y) = x \implies \lambda y(1 - y) = x.\]
Since $y = \lambda x(1 - x)$, we substitute this into the equation:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
We need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which this equation has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To simplify the problem, let's consider the case where $f(x) = x$. This would give us the fixed points of the function $f(x)$. We solve the equation:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x \implies x(\lambda(1 - x) - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ and $x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}$. For $x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}$ to be in the interval $[0,1]$, we need $0 \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1$, which implies $\lambda \geq 1$.

Now, we need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which there exists an $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x$. We will consider the quadratic nature of the function and the condition $f(f(x)) = x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can also consider the case where $f(x) = -x + c$ for some constant $c$, but since $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ is a quadratic function, we can directly analyze the equation $f(f(x)) = x$. By substituting $y = f(x)$, we get:
\[f(y) = x \implies \lambda y(1 - y) = x.\]
Substituting $y = \lambda x(1 - x)$, we get:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This is a quartic equation in terms of $x$, and solving it directly is complex. Instead, we can use the fact that $f(x) = x$ has solutions $x = 0$ and $x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}$ for $\lambda \geq 1$. We need to find $\lambda$ such that $f(f(x)) = x$ has a solution $x \neq f(x)$.

By analyzing the function and the equation, we can see that $\lambda = 2$ is a special case. For $\lambda = 2$, the function becomes $f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2$. We can verify if this value of $\lambda$ satisfies the condition.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

For $\lambda = 2$, we have $f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2$. We need to check if there exists an $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x$.
\[f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).\]
We set $f(f(x)) = x$:
\[2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = x.\]
This equation needs to be solved to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the condition. However, we can also verify if $\lambda = 2$ is the only solution by considering the range of $\lambda$ and the properties of the function.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can also consider the boundary values of $\lambda$. For $\lambda = 4$, the function becomes $f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2$. We can check if this value of $\lambda$ satisfies the condition.
\[f(f(x)) = f(4x - 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2).\]
We set $f(f(x)) = x$:
\[4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = x.\]
This equation is also complex to solve directly. However, we can use the fact that the function $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ is a quadratic function, and the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ is a quartic equation.

By analyzing the function and the equation, we can see that the value of $\lambda$ that satisfies the condition is $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 4$ is also a boundary value that needs to be checked.

The problem involves finding the measure in degrees of the smallest positive angle $\theta$ for which a given expression involving trigonometric functions equals $\tan \theta$. The expression is quite complex, involving multiple angles and trigonometric identities.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We start by simplifying the given expression using trigonometric identities. The expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the product-to-sum identities and angle addition formulas to simplify the expression. First, let's focus on the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can rewrite the terms using the angle addition formula:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can rewrite the terms using the angle addition formula:
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Now, the expression for $\tan \theta$ is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).
\]
Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ.
\]
So, the expression for $\tan \theta$ becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}.

We know that $\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}$, so the smallest positive angle $\theta$ is:

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let's set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \([-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

So, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \). We can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

The problem involves a complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = a \), where \( a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We recognize that \( a \) is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation \( a^2 = a + 1 \).

We can use the recurrence relation for the powers of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \):
\[ z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right) = a \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right). \]

Starting with \( n = 2 \):
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 - 2 = a + 1 - 2 = a - 1. \]

For \( n = 3 \):
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = a \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) - \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) = a(a - 1) - a = a^2 - 2a = (a + 1) - 2a = 1 - a. \]

For \( n = 4 \):
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = a \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) - \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = a(1 - a) - (a - 1) = a - a^2 - a + 1 = 1 - a^2 = 1 - (a + 1) = -a. \]

For \( n = 5 \):
\[ z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = a \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) - \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) = a(-a) - (1 - a) = -a^2 - 1 + a = -(a + 1) - 1 + a = -2. \]

For \( n = 6 \):
\[ z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = a \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) - \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) = a(-2) - (-a) = -2a + a = -a. \]

We observe that \( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = -a \) and \( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = -2 \). This suggests a periodic pattern with a period of 12, since \( z^{12} + \frac{1}{z^{12}} = z^0 + \frac{1}{z^0} = 2 \) would complete the cycle.

[ADVANCE]

To find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we can reduce the exponent modulo 12:
\[ 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}. \]
Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

The problem involves finding the area of triangle $ENG$ given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144. We need to use the properties of medians, the centroid, and similar triangles to solve this problem.

[ADVANCE]

1. The centroid $G$ divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.
2. The line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ at $M$ and $AC$ at $N$. This means that $\triangle AMN$ is similar to $\triangle ABC$ by the AA similarity criterion.
3. Since $G$ is the centroid, the height of $\triangle ENG$ is one-third of the height of $\triangle EBC$. Also, $EN$ is one-third of $EB$ because $G$ divides the median $BE$ in a 2:1 ratio.
4. The area of $\triangle EBC$ is one-half of the area of $\triangle ABC$ because $BE$ is a median. So, the area of $\triangle EBC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 144 = 72$.
5. Since $\triangle ENG$ is similar to $\triangle EBC$ and the ratio of their corresponding sides is 1:3, the ratio of their areas is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}$. Therefore, the area of $\triangle ENG$ is $\frac{1}{9}$ of the area of $\triangle EBC$.

We are given an arithmetic sequence with the fourth term ($a_4$) equal to 200 and the eighth term ($a_8$) equal to 500. We need to find the sixth term ($a_6$).

[ADVANCE]

In an arithmetic sequence, the $n$-th term is given by the formula:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.

Given:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $a_1$:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference $d$, we can substitute it back into the equation for the fourth term to find $a_1$:
\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have $a_1$ and $d$, we can find the sixth term ($a_6$):
\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ to a decimal finite decimal. To do this, we need to express the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10, which is $2^a \cdot 5^b$ where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers and $a = b$.

[ADVANCE]

The denominator $2^2 \cdot 5^7$ can be rewritten as $2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot \frac{2^5}{2^5} = \frac{2^7 \cdot 5^7}{2^5} = \frac{10^7}{2^5}$. Therefore, the fraction becomes $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{10^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}$.

The fraction $\frac{672}{10^7}$ can be expressed as a decimal by dividing 672 by $10^7$, which is equivalent to moving the decimal point in 672 seven places to the left. Therefore, $\frac{672}{10^7} = 0.0000672$.

First, we find the prime factorization of 100 and 150:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

Next, we determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 by taking the lowest power of each common prime factor:

[ADVANCE]

To determine the values of $n$, we need to find the divisors of 24, because $2^{24}$ being a perfect $n$th power implies that the exponent 24 must be divisible by $n$. The number of divisors of 24 will give us the possible values of $n$.

The prime factorization of 24 is $24 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1$. The number of divisors of a number can be found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying the results. Therefore, the number of divisors of 24 is $(3+1)(1+1) = 4 \cdot 2 = 8$.

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since $n > 1$, we exclude 1 from the list of divisors.

The possible values of $n$ are the divisors of 24 excluding 1, which are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Therefore, there are 7 possible values of $n$.

To have an even sum, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the remaining five numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, and 13) are odd.

The goal is to find the probability that a piece is placed on a shaded square of the chessboard.

When the first number is divided by 4, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0. Since the remainders 1, 2, 3 are the ones that matter for the columns, we can consider the effective remainders as 1, 2, 3, each appearing 2 times out of 8, i.e., with a probability of $\frac{1}{4}$ each.

2. **Determine the possible outcomes for the second spin**: The wheel is divided into 10 equal sections, numbered from 1 to 10. When the second number is divided by 5, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0. Since the remainders 1, 2, 3, 4 are the ones that matter for the rows, we can consider the effective remainders as 1, 2, 3, 4, each appearing 2 times out of 10, i.e., with a probability of $\frac{1}{5}$ each.

3. **Identify the shaded squares on the chessboard**: The chessboard has 8 columns and 8 rows. The shaded squares are those where the column number and row number sum to an odd number. We need to count the number of shaded squares for each combination of column and row.

4. **Calculate the probability of landing on a shaded square**: We need to consider the probability of each combination of column and row and count the number of shaded squares.

Let's calculate the probability step by step.

[ADVANCE]

The columns are determined by the remainders of the first spin divided by 4, which are 1, 2, 3, each with a probability of $\frac{1}{4}$. The rows are determined by the remainders of the second spin divided by 5, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, each with a probability of $\frac{1}{5}$.

The chessboard has 8 columns and 8 rows, but we are only considering the remainders 1, 2, 3 for the columns and 1, 2, 3, 4 for the rows. We need to count the number of shaded squares for each combination of column and row.

The shaded squares are those where the column number and row number sum to an odd number. Let's count the number of shaded squares:

- For column 1 (remainder 1), the shaded rows are 2, 4 (2 rows)
- For column 2 (remainder 2), the shaded rows are 1, 3 (2 rows)
- For column 3 (remainder 3), the shaded rows are 2, 4 (2 rows)

So, there are a total of $2 + 2 + 2 = 6$ shaded squares out of a total of $3 \times 4 = 12$ possible squares.

The probability of landing on a shaded square is the number of shaded squares divided by the total number of possible squares, which is $\frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}$.

However, we need to consider the probability of each column and row being selected. Since each column and row is selected with the corresponding probability, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of the column and row.

Since the probability of selecting each column is $\frac{1}{4}$ and the probability of selecting each row is $\frac{1}{5}$, the overall probability of landing on a shaded square is $\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the probability that the piece is placed on a shaded square of the chessboard is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ).
\]
Since $\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ$, and $\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ$, the product simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ) = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}$. Now, we need to find the product of the remaining terms.

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x$ to simplify the product. Let's apply this identity to the terms $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

The problem asks for the geometric shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) and \(\theta\) represent the radial distance and angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, respectively, and \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane. The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height above the \(xy\)-plane is constant.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since the height \(z\) is constant and does not depend on \(r\) or \(\theta\), the equation \(z = c\) describes a surface where the \(z\)-coordinate is the same for all values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This means that for any point in the \(xy\)-plane, the \(z\)-coordinate is fixed at \(c\), which forms a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane.

Next action: [SYNTHESIZE]

Combining the understanding of cylindrical coordinates and the equation \(z = c\), we can conclude that the shape described by the equation is a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a constant height \(z = c\).

We need to find the smallest possible angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, we can express $g(x)$ as $g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015$.

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Specifically, for a cubic polynomial of the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the sum of the roots is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are the values of $x$ such that $f(x + 5) = 0$. If $r_1, r_2, r_3$ are the roots of $f(x)$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

The sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is therefore $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15$.

From the function $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, we can see that the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is $-\frac{-49}{1} = 49$.

Thus, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 15 = 34$.

The problem requires us to calculate the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression as:

Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\), we can further rewrite the expression as:
\[

This simplifies to:
\[

We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to proceed.

\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ.

So the expression becomes:

The problem involves finding the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$. We need to use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$. The sum of all interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. Since the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, the measure of the remaining angle is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}$. Since this is an interior angle of a convex polygon, its measure must be less than $180^{\circ}$.

We can set up the equation:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ}.
\]
Dividing both sides by $180^{\circ}$, we get:
\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}.
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
\[
n-2 < 6.9444.
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we get:
\[
n < 8.9444.
\]
Thus, the possible values for $n$ are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. However, we need to find the exact value of $n$.

We also know that the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, so the total sum of all interior angles is $1070^{\circ} + x$, where $x$ is the measure of the remaining angle. This sum must equal $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. Therefore, we can write:
\[
1070^{\circ} + x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}.
\]
Since $x$ is an interior angle of a convex polygon, $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$. We can test the possible values of $n$ to find the correct one.

Let's start with $n = 8$:
\[
(8-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 6 \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1080^{\circ}.
\]
If $n = 8$, then the measure of the remaining angle is:
\[
1080^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} = 10^{\circ},
\]
which is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon.

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is $8$.

\boxed{8}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start with the congruence equation given in the problem:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find that \( 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Next, we substitute these values back into the expression for \( t \):
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
and
\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer, we discard \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \) and keep \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

The volume of a cube is given by $V = s^3$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the cube. We can find the side length $s$ of the cube by taking the cube root of the volume.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}\) is \(\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\), we can simplify the expression inside the sine function.

For \(x > 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

For \(x < 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

However, we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Now, we can substitute this into the original equation:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have:
\[
1 = \frac{1}{3},

which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption or simplification might be incorrect, or there might be a restriction we need to consider.

Given the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\). However, we need to be careful with the argument of the sine function.

Let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then, \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\). Substituting this into the original equation, we get:
\[
\sin \left( \theta + \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Again, we know that \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), which leads to a contradiction. This suggests that we need to reconsider the problem or check for any potential errors in the simplification process.

However, we can also approach this problem by using the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

Let's denote \(A = \tan^{-1} (x)\) and \(B = \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\). Then, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Using the angle addition formula, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\sin A = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), \(\cos A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), \(\sin B = \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), and \(\cos B = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), we substitute these values into the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x^2}{1+x^2} + \frac{1}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Combining the fractions, we get:
\[
\frac{x^2 + 1}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\frac{x^2 + 1}{1+x^2} = 1\), we have:
\[
1 = \frac{1}{3},
\]
which is still a contradiction. This suggests that there might be no real solutions to the equation.

The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines, which involves the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point on each line.

Let's denote the point on the first line as \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and the point on the second line as \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

The problem presents a rectangular region with vertices at $(5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4)$. We need to find the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside this rectangle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The rectangle's width is the distance between $x = 5$ and $x = -5$, which is $5 - (-5) = 10$. The rectangle's height is the distance between $y = 4$ and $y = -4$, which is $4 - (-4) = 8$.

Since we are looking for points strictly inside the rectangle, we exclude the boundary points. Therefore, the $x$-coordinates of the interior points will range from $-4$ to $4$ (excluding $-5$ and $5$), and the $y$-coordinates will range from $-3$ to $3$ (excluding $-4$ and $4$).

To calculate $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$, we can use the distributive property of the cross product:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.\]
Using the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, we get:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}).\]
Since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, we have:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).\]
We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).\]
Now, we can substitute the given values:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
Performing the scalar multiplications, we get:

Combining the vectors, we have:

The problem involves finding the average price of stamps from the 1970s in Juan's collection. We are given the number of stamps from each country for each decade, and the prices for each country's stamps.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the average price of stamps from the 1970s, we need to calculate the total cost of the stamps from the 1970s and then divide by the total number of stamps from the 1970s.

From the table, the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s is:
- Brazil: 12
- France: 12
- Peru: 6
- Spain: 13

The prices for each country's stamps are:
- Brazil and Peru (America do Sul): 6 cents each
- France and Spain (Europa): 5 cents (France) and 4 cents (Spain)

We can calculate the total cost of the stamps from the 1970s:
- Brazil: $12 \times 6 = 72$ cents
- France: $12 \times 5 = 60$ cents
- Peru: $6 \times 6 = 36$ cents
- Spain: $13 \times 4 = 52$ cents

The total cost of the stamps from the 1970s is:
$72 + 60 + 36 + 52 = 220$ cents

The total number of stamps from the 1970s is:
$12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43$

The average price of the stamps from the 1970s is:

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ bisects the angle $\angle BAD$. We also know that the area of the trapezoid $[ABCD] = 42$. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects the angle $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, we can conclude that $\triangle ACB \cong \triangle ACD$ by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) postulate. This is because $\angle BAC = \angle CAD$ (since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$), $\angle ACB = \angle ACD = 90^\circ$ (since $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$), and $\overline{AC}$ is a common side.

Since $\triangle ACB \cong \triangle ACD$, the areas of these two triangles are equal. Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Then the area of $\triangle ACB$ is also $x$.

The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ACB$ and $\triangle ACD$, which is $x + x = 2x$. We are given that $[ABCD] = 42$, so we can set up the equation:
\[2x = 42.\]

The problem is to solve the equation $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$ for $x$.

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:
\[
2\sqrt{2x} = 3\sqrt{3x-1}
\]
Next, we can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(2\sqrt{2x})^2 = (3\sqrt{3x-1})^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9(3x-1)
\]
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Now, we can isolate $x$ by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]
\[
-19x = -9
\]
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]
We need to verify that this solution satisfies the original equation, particularly that the expression under the square root is non-negative.

[VERIFY]
We need to check that $x = \frac{9}{19}$ satisfies the original equation and that the expressions under the square roots are non-negative.
For the expression under the square root in the numerator, we have:
\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} \geq 0

For the expression under the square root in the denominator, we have:
\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We can directly apply the defined operation to the given fractions. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, we have $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Plugging these values into the operation definition, we get:

The problem involves determining the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, intersect within a circle. To approach this, we need to consider the geometric properties and the total number of possible configurations of the points.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ordering the points around the circle. When we randomly place four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ on a circle, we can think of the order in which these points appear when we travel around the circle.

The total number of ways to arrange four points around a circle is the same as the number of ways to arrange four points in a circular permutation, which is $(4-1)! = 3! = 6$.

Now, let's consider the intersecting condition. The segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect if and only if the points $A$ and $B$ separate the points $C$ and $D$ when traveling around the circle. This means that the points must be in one of the following orders: $ACBD$, $ADBC$, $CBAD$, or $CDBA$. These are the only orders in which the segments will intersect.

There are 4 favorable orders out of the 6 possible orders. Therefore, the probability that the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

[ADVANCE]

The probability is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

However, we need to consider if this is the correct interpretation and calculation for the problem.

[VERIFY]

Upon reviewing the problem and the calculation, it appears that the approach is correct. The key insight is that the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if the points are in one of the specific orders that we identified. The total number of possible orders and the number of favorable orders were correctly calculated.

Therefore, the probability that the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is indeed $\frac{1}{3}$, not $\frac{2}{3}$, because the correct number of favorable outcomes is 2 out of the 6 possible orders for the segments to intersect, which is half of the total orders, but the correct interpretation is that for any order of the points, only half of the time the segments will intersect.

The correct calculation is:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

But we can also think of it in a different way, by choosing any four points on the circle, and then fixing one of the points, the other three points can be arranged in such a way that the segments intersect in exactly half of the cases.

So the correct answer is indeed $\frac{1}{3}$.

The problem involves finding the measure of the angle $\angle ADC$ given the areas of two circles and the shaded region. The smaller circle has a radius of 1, and the larger circle has a radius of 2. The area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The area of the larger circle is $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$. The area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, which is $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.

Let's denote the measure of the angle $\angle ADC$ as $\theta$ (in radians). The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle $\theta$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 \cdot \theta = 2\theta$. The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle $\theta$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta$.

The area of the shaded region is the difference between the area of the sector of the larger circle and the area of the sector of the smaller circle: $2\theta - \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{3}{2}\theta$. We know this area is equal to $\frac{5\pi}{3}$, so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Solving for $\theta$, we get:
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{9}
\]

Since the angle $\theta$ is in radians, we need to convert it to degrees. We know that $\pi$ radians is equal to $180^\circ$, so:
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{10 \cdot 180}{9} = 200^\circ

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we know that \(\alpha\) is in the first quadrant, so \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we know that \(\beta\) is in the first quadrant, so \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta

Substituting the values of \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\), we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}

\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta)\):

The problem requires us to find the number of ways to form a subcomitê of 5 members from a committee of 8 republicanos and 6 democratas, with the condition that the subcomitê must have at least one member from each party.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcomitê of 5 members from the total of 14 members (8 republicanos + 6 democratas). Then, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcomitê with only republicanos or only democratas, as these cases do not meet the condition of having at least one member from each party.

The total number of ways to form a subcomitê of 5 members from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of members and $k$ is the number of members to be chosen.

The total number of ways to form a subcomitê of 5 members from 14 members is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcomitê with only republicanos. Since there are 8 republicanos, the number of ways to choose 5 republicanos is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcomitê with only democratas. Since there are 6 democratas, the number of ways to choose 5 democratas is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcomitê of 5 members with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a subcomitê minus the number of ways to form a subcomitê with only republicanos or only democratas:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Solving for \(n\), we get:
\[
n^2 = 25 \implies n = \pm 5
\]
Since we are looking for integers, both \(n = 5\) and \(n = -5\) are potential solutions. We need to check which set of consecutive integers satisfies the original product condition.

[ADVANCE]

For \(n = 5\), the three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\). Let's check their product:
\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]
This satisfies the product condition. Now, let's check the second condition:
\[
\frac{4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]
This also satisfies the second condition.

For \(n = -5\), the three consecutive integers are \(-6, -5, -4\). Let's check their product:
\[
(-6) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-4) = -120
\]
This does not satisfy the product condition since the product is -120, not 120.

Therefore, the only valid solution is \(n = 5\), and the three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\). The largest of these integers is 6.

The problem requires solving for the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[

\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Since the problem specifies that we are looking for the positive value of \( x \), we discard the negative solution.

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} - 2 \pi \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

So the expression becomes \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\) to simplify the expression. Let's pair the terms and use the identity \(\cos x \cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x \cos x = -\frac{1}{2} (\cos (2x) + 1)\).

However, a more efficient approach is to use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{1}{8} \sin 16x / \sin x.
\]
We can rewrite the expression in terms of this identity by adjusting the angles:

Since \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\), we have:

\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).

Now, we can use the identity:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) / \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).
\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:
\[

We are given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\). There is a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). Let \(BM = CM = x\). Then \(BC = 2x\).

In \(\triangle ABM\), we have \(AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\).

Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we can use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 180^\circ - \angle BDA\). Let \(\angle BAD = \alpha\), then \(\angle BDA = 180^\circ - 3\theta - \alpha\).

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\), we get:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD}
\]
Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle BCD = \theta\), we have:
\[
\frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \theta}
\]

We also know that \(BD = \sqrt{BM^2 + MD^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\).

Substituting \(BD\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\sin \theta}
\]

Using the triple angle identity \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
\frac{2x}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\sin \theta}
\]

Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
2x \sin \theta = (3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta) \sqrt{x^2 + 1}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
2x = (3 - 4\sin^2 \theta) \sqrt{x^2 + 1}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
4x^2 = (3 - 4\sin^2 \theta)^2 (x^2 + 1)
\]

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\4x^2 = (9 - 24\sin^2 \theta + 16\sin^4 \theta)(x^2 + 1)\]

Since \(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{AM^2 - MD^2}{AB^2} = \frac{11^2 - 1^2}{AB^2} = \frac{120}{AB^2}\), we can substitute this into the equation.

However, we can also use the fact that \(\triangle ABM\) is a right triangle to find \(AB\). Let's use the fact that \(\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}\).

Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we can use the fact that \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{BC}{MD} = \frac{2x}{1}\).

Using the triple angle identity for tangent, we get:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}
\]

Substituting \(\tan \theta = \frac{x}{11}\), we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{1} = \frac{3\frac{x}{11} - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
2x = \frac{\frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}\), we get:
\[
2x \left(1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}\right) = \frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
2x - \frac{6x^3}{121} = \frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 1331, we get:
\[
2662x - \frac{6x^3 \cdot 1331}{121} = 3x \cdot 121 - x^3
\]

Simplifying further, we get:
\[
2662x - 66x^3 = 363x - x^3
\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
2662x - 363x = 66x^3 - x^3
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
2299x = 65x^3
\]

Dividing both sides by \(x\), we get:
\[
2299 = 65x^2
\]

Solving for \(x^2\), we get:
\[
x^2 = \frac{2299}{65} = 35.37692307692308 \approx 36
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
x = \sqrt{36} = 6
\]

Now, we can find \(AB\):
\[
AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{121 + 36} = \sqrt{157}
\]

The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = \sqrt{157} + \sqrt{157} + 2 \cdot 6 = 2\sqrt{157} + 12

Therefore, the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first integer in the sequence as $x$. Since the integers are consecutive, the sequence can be written as $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26$. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum is $3^7 = 2187$, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the first and last term is $\frac{x + (x+26)}{2} = x+13$. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 2187. \]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we solve for $x$:
\[ 27(x+13) = 2187, \]
\[ x+13 = \frac{2187}{27}, \]
\[ x+13 = 81, \]
\[ x = 81 - 13, \]
\[ x = 68. \]

The sequence of integers is $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$. The median of this sequence is the 14th term, which is $68 + 13 = 81$.

The problem requires finding the values of $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds. We need to break this into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$.

We can factorize the quadratic expression: $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where this inequality is satisfied. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we know that $y \geq 0$. Therefore, we only consider the interval where $y$ is non-negative. The inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ is satisfied when $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2 \geq 0$, the valid interval is $0 \leq y < 3$. Substituting back $y = x^2$, we get $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which implies $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factorized as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ and it is equal to 0 only when $x^2 = -2$ (which has no real solutions), the inequality $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ is satisfied for all real $x$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. The solution to the first inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, and the solution to the second inequality is all real $x$. Therefore, the intersection of these solutions is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

\end{align*}
We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relationship between $s$ and $p$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the third equation as
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Given that $xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12$ and $xyz = 4$, we can substitute these values into the equation:
\[12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = sp - 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\]
\[sp = 24.\]
We can express $p$ in terms of $s$ from the second equation:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which further simplifies to
\[s^3 = 64.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[s = 4.\]
Now, we can find $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s} = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $p = 6$.

The numerator is an absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative (or zero). The denominator is a quadratic expression \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) will be satisfied when the denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is negative, since the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative.

We need to find the intervals where \(x(x - 36) < 0\). The roots of the quadratic equation \(x(x - 36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We can test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\): \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), let's test \(x = 1\): \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 37\): \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37 > 0\).

From the tests, we see that the inequality \(x(x - 36) < 0\) is satisfied in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we also need to consider the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, since the original expression is undefined at those points. The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values must be excluded from the solution.

The problem involves finding the maximum area of a rectangular field that is surrounded by an athletic track. The track consists of two straight sides of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangular field as \( L \) and the width as \( W \). The two semicircles at the ends of the field each have a radius equal to half the width of the field, i.e., \( r = \frac{W}{2} \).

The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. Since the circumference of a semicircle is \( \pi r \), the total perimeter of the track is:
\[ 2L + 2 \cdot \pi \cdot \frac{W}{2} = 2L + \pi W \]
We are given that the perimeter of the track is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We need to express the area of the rectangular field in terms of one variable. The area \( A \) of the field is given by:
\[ A = L \cdot W \]

From the perimeter equation, we can solve for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ 2L = 400 - \pi W \]
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area equation, we get:
\[ A = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) W \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
\[ \pi W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Now, we substitute this value of \( W \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} \]
\[ L = 200 - 100 \]
\[ L = 100 \]

The area of the field is:
\[ A = L \cdot W = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the length of the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ has length 2 and the hypotenuse has length 5.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this length as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle $T$, the opposite side is the side that was previously the adjacent side to angle $R$, which has length $\sqrt{21}$, and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, $\sin T = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The value of $\sin T$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.

The problem asks for the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)$. We need to find the point on the graph that is closest to the origin and then calculate the distance.

[ADVANCE]

The distance $D$ between the origin $(0,0)$ and a point $(x,y)$ on the graph is given by the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
Since $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)$, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's define a function $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$ and find its minimum value.

[ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
This gives us three critical points: $x = 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$, and $x = -\sqrt{2}$.
We need to evaluate the second derivative to determine the nature of these critical points:
\[ f''(x) = 6x^2 - 4 \]
Evaluating the second derivative at the critical points:
\[ f''(0) = -4 \quad (\text{which is negative, indicating a local maximum}) \]
\[ f''(\sqrt{2}) = 6(\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \quad (\text{which is positive, indicating a local minimum}) \]
\[ f''(-\sqrt{2}) = 6(-\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \quad (\text{which is positive, indicating a local minimum}) \]
So, the local minima occur at $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $x = -\sqrt{2}$. We can use either of these points to find the minimum distance. Let's use $x = \sqrt{2}$.
Substituting $x = \sqrt{2}$ into the expression for $y$:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \]
Now, we can find the distance $D$:
\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{4}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \]
\[ D = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ D = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The minimum distance is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$, which is in the form $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$ where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

The problem involves finding the inverse function values for a piecewise function $f(x)$ and then summing those values. The function $f(x)$ is defined as:
\[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3-x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3+2x^2+3x & \text{if } x>3.
\end{array}
\right.\]
We need to find $f^{-1}(0)$ and $f^{-1}(6)$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find $f^{-1}(0)$, we need to solve $f(x) = 0$ for $x$. We will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For $x \leq 3$, we have $3 - x = 0$, which gives $x = 3$.
2. For $x > 3$, we have $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0$. Factoring out $x$, we get $x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0$. Since $x > 3$, $x \neq 0$, so we need to solve $-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $2^2 - 4(-1)(3) = 4 + 12 = 16$, which is positive, so the equation has real roots. Using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we get $x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}$. This gives us $x = \frac{-2 + 4}{-2} = -1$ and $x = \frac{-2 - 4}{-2} = 3$. Since $x > 3$, neither of these roots is in the domain of this case, so there is no solution for $x > 3$.

Thus, $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.

Next, to find $f^{-1}(6)$, we need to solve $f(x) = 6$ for $x$. Again, we will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For $x \leq 3$, we have $3 - x = 6$, which gives $x = -3$. Since $-3 \leq 3$, this is a valid solution.
2. For $x > 3$, we have $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6$. Rearranging, we get $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0$. We can use trial and error or numerical methods to find the roots, but we can also check if there are any obvious integer solutions. By inspection, $x = 2$ is not a solution (since $2$ is not in the domain $x > 3$), and $x = 3$ is not a solution (since $3$ is not in the domain $x > 3$). We can try $x = 6$: $-6^3 + 2(6^2) + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \neq 0$, so $x = 6$ is not a solution. However, we can try $x = 2$ in the wrong domain and then check for other values. Since we already checked $x=2$ and it's less than 3, we should look for other values. We can use synthetic division or numerical methods, but for simplicity, let's assume we found that $x=2$ is not the solution we are looking for in this domain, and we need to ensure we cover all possibilities. Given the complexity, we should verify if there's a simpler approach or if the solution is indeed in the other case.

Thus, $f^{-1}(6) = -3$.

Finally, we sum the values: $f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0$.

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to five of its vertices. The distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and the distance between any two adjacent vertices is the same. Let's denote the side length of the octahedron as $s$. The distance from any vertex to the center of the octahedron is $\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Let the coordinates of the vertices be $\left(\pm\frac{s}{2}, 0, 0\right)$, $\left(0, \pm\frac{s}{2}, 0\right)$, and $\left(0, 0, \pm\frac{s}{2}\right)$. Assume the point $P$ has coordinates $(x, y, z)$.

The distances from $P$ to the vertices can be expressed using the distance formula. Let's denote the distance from $P$ to the vertex $\left(\frac{s}{2}, 0, 0\right)$ as $d_1 = 3$, to the vertex $\left(-\frac{s}{2}, 0, 0\right)$ as $d_2 = 7$, to the vertex $\left(0, \frac{s}{2}, 0\right)$ as $d_3 = 8$, to the vertex $\left(0, -\frac{s}{2}, 0\right)$ as $d_4 = 9$, and to the vertex $\left(0, 0, \frac{s}{2}\right)$ as $d_5 = 11$.

Using the distance formula, we can write the following equations:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3,
\]
\[
\sqrt{\left(x + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2} = 8,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \left(y + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2} = 9,
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2} = 11.
\]

Next, we can square both sides of each equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
\left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9,
\]
\[
\left(x + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49,
\]
\[
x^2 + \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 64,
\]
\[
x^2 + \left(y + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 81,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 121.
\]

By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[
\left(x + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 - \left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 40,
\]
\[
4x \cdot \frac{s}{2} = 40,
\]
\[
xs = 20.
\]

By subtracting the third equation from the fourth, we get:
\[
\left(y + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 - \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 17,
\]
\[
4y \cdot \frac{s}{2} = 17,
\]
\[
ys = \frac{17}{2}.
\]

By subtracting the third equation from the fifth, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 - x^2 - \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 - z^2 = 57,
\]
\[
\left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 - \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 57,
\]
\[
z^2 - 2z \cdot \frac{s}{2} + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 - y^2 + 2y \cdot \frac{s}{2} - \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 57,
\]
\[
z^2 - y^2 + s(z - y) = 57.
\]

We can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant and equal to $4s^2 + 4d^2$, where $d$ is the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron. However, we can also use the symmetry and the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant.

The sum of the squares of the given distances is:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324.
\]

The sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is $4s^2 + 4d^2$, but since we are looking for the sixth distance, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant and equal to $4s^2 + 4d^2$, but we can also use the symmetry.

Let the sixth distance be $d_6$. Then:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 = 4s^2 + 4d^2.
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is $4s^2 + 4d^2$, but we can also use the symmetry.

We can find $s$ using the equations we derived earlier. However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances is constant.

Let's use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances is constant:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 = 4s^2 + 4d^2.

Since we have the equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $s$, we can find $s$ and then find $d_6$.

However, we can use a simpler approach. The sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances is constant to find the sixth distance.

\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
324 + d_6^2 = 2 \times 324.
\]

Solving for $d_6^2$, we get:
\[
d_6^2 = 648 - 324 = 324.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
d_6 = \sqrt{324} = 18.
\]

First, we need to convert the decimal number $629_{10}$ to its base 7 and base 8 representations.

\[89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5\]

\[1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1\]
So, the base 7 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1556_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 8, we perform the following divisions:
\[629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5\]
\[78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6\]
\[9 \div 8 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1\]
\[1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1\]
So, the base 8 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1165_8$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find $g(x) = f(x-1)$, we need to substitute $x-1$ for $x$ in the polynomial $f(x)$. This gives us:
\[g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2.\]
We will expand each term to obtain the polynomial $g(x)$.

First, expand $(x-1)^4$:
\[(x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1.\]
Next, expand $(x-1)^2$:
\[(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1.\]
Now, substitute these expansions back into the expression for $g(x)$:
\[g(x) = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) + 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 9(x - 1) - 2.\]

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ is obtained by evaluating the polynomial at $x = 1$. Therefore, we can find the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$ by calculating $g(1)$:
\[g(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15.\]

Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)$. Now, we can substitute these values into the distance formula:

We need to find the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$.

\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

We also know that:
\[
(ab + bc + ca) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
(ab + bc + ca) = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4^2\alpha_2 + \alpha_2\alpha_4^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4\alpha_3 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_4^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4\alpha_1.
\]
This can be simplified to:
\[
(ab + bc + ca) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - 4\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4.
\]
Using the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:
\[
(ab + bc + ca) = (0)(-2) - 4(2) = -8.
\]

Since $a + b + c = 0$, we can use the identity $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)$ to find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$:
\[
0 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(-8) \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 16.
\]

Given that $a + b + c = 0$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 16$, the only possible values for $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the roots of the equation $t^3 - 8 = 0$, which are $2$, $-1 + \sqrt{3}i$, and $-1 - \sqrt{3}i$.

We need to determine the cost of a single pencil. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The cost of 3 pencils and 1 jumbo eraser is $1.24.
2. The cost of 5 pencils and 1 jumbo eraser is $1.82.

Let's denote the cost of a pencil as \( p \) and the cost of a jumbo eraser as \( e \). We can set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

\[
\begin{cases}
3p + e = 1.24 \\
5p + e = 1.82

Our objective is to find the value of \( p \).

We can solve the system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( e \):

\[

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region within the rectangle where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any vertex, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining a vertex to the center $O$ will divide the rectangle into regions where points are closer to $O$ or to the vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the line segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will intersect at the center $O$ and will form a smaller rectangle whose sides are parallel to the sides of the original rectangle $ABCD$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the line segments joining the center $O$ to the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle.

The area of the smaller rectangle will be the region where a point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex. Since the smaller rectangle is similar to the original rectangle and is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle, its side lengths will be half of the corresponding side lengths of the original rectangle.

Let the side lengths of the original rectangle $ABCD$ be $2a$ and $2b$, so that $AB = 2a$ and $AD = 2b$. The area of the original rectangle is $4ab$. The side lengths of the smaller rectangle will be $a$ and $b$, so its area is $ab$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}$.

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) at three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, we need to evaluate each of the given values:
1. \( \frac{\pi}{3} \): Since \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \), which is less than 4. Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).
2. \( \sqrt{45} \): Since \( \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708 \), which is greater than 4. Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).
3. \( 8^{2/3} \): Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), which is equal to 4. Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

The problem presents a magic square, where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals are equal. We need to find the value of \( n \).

\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\

\]

We can start by using the property of the magic square that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. Let's denote this common sum as \( S \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can start by calculating the sum of the first row:
\[ S = (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n - 1 \]

Next, we can calculate the sum of the second row:
\[ S = (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \]

Since the sum of each row is equal, we can set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[ 2n - 1 = 3n - 6 \]

We can solve this equation for \( n \):
\[ 2n - 1 = 3n - 6 \]
\[ -1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \]
\[ 5 = n \]

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 5 \).

Next action: [VERIFY]

[VERIFY]

We have found that \( n = 5 \). To verify this solution, we can check if the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is indeed the same when \( n = 5 \).

First, we substitute \( n = 5 \) into the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

Now, we calculate the sum of each row:
\[ \text{Sum of the first row} = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 \]
\[ \text{Sum of the second row} = 7 + 1 + 1 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Sum of the third row} = 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 \]

We notice that the sums of the rows are not all equal, which indicates an error in our previous conclusion. We need to re-evaluate our approach.

Let's recalculate the sum of the first column:
\[ S = (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \]

We can also calculate the sum of the second column:
\[ S = 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6 \]

Since the sum of each column is equal, we can set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[ 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]

We can solve this equation for \( n \):
\[ 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]
\[ 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \]
\[ 7 = n \]

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \).

Now, we calculate the sum of each row:
\[ \text{Sum of the first row} = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \]
\[ \text{Sum of the second row} = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \]
\[ \text{Sum of the third row} = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \]

We calculate the sum of each column:
\[ \text{Sum of the first column} = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \]
\[ \text{Sum of the second column} = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \]
\[ \text{Sum of the third column} = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \]

We calculate the sum of the diagonals:
\[ \text{Sum of the main diagonal} = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \]
\[ \text{Sum of the other diagonal} = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \]

Since the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is equal to 15, our solution is correct.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the distance traveled by Jim, we need to calculate the length of the diagonal of the rectangular field. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this purpose. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Here, the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse, and the length and width of the rectangle are the other two sides.

The distance traveled by Jim is:
\[
\sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

The distance traveled by Martha is the sum of the length and width of the field:
\[
300 + 400 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}

Therefore, Jim walks 200 feet less than Martha.

[ADVANCE]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}\). They satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We can use this property to simplify the given expression. First, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]
Since \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{2 - 1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
However, we need to consider the case when \(\omega = 1\), because in that case, the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is not defined. When \(\omega = 1\), the expression becomes \(\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\).

So, we have two possible values for the expression: \(\frac{1}{2}\) when \(\omega \neq 1\), and \(1\) when \(\omega = 1\).

The possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) are \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(1\).

To find the minimum distance, we can calculate the total distance for each possible Hamiltonian cycle and then compare them. There are $3! = 6$ possible Hamiltonian cycles starting from each point, but due to symmetry, we only need to consider the cycles starting from point $A$ and then multiply the result by 4 (since the graph is symmetric and each point is equivalent).

Let's calculate the total distance for each possible Hamiltonian cycle starting from point $A$:

1. $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow A$: $AB + BC + CD + DA = 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20$
2. $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow D \rightarrow C \rightarrow A$: $AB + BD + DC + CA = 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19$
3. $A \rightarrow C \rightarrow B \rightarrow D \rightarrow A$: $AC + CB + BD + DA = 6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 19$
4. $A \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow B \rightarrow A$: $AC + CD + DB + BA = 6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19$
