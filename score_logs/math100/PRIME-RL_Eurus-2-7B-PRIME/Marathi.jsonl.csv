We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7$. We are also given that $EF = 7$.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the given information to find the length of the hypotenuse $DF$. Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7$, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse $DF$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Solving for $DE^2$, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

[OUTPUT]

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given two complex numbers $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$ which is the result of rotating $z$ about $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in the clockwise direction.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find $w$, we can use the concept of rotation in the complex plane. The rotation of a complex number $z$ about another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$ can be achieved by translating the plane so that $c$ is at the origin, rotating, and then translating back. The formula for this rotation is:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{-i\theta} \]
where $\theta$ is the angle of rotation in the counterclockwise direction. Since we are rotating clockwise by $\frac{\pi}{4}$, we use $\theta = -\frac{\pi}{4}$.

First, we calculate $z - c$:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \]

Next, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$ (which is the same as $e^{-i(-\frac{\pi}{4})}$):
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} i \right) = (1 - 3i)(1 + i) = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 - 2i + 3 = 4 - 2i \]

Finally, we add $c$ to the result to get $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

So, the complex number $w$ is $\boxed{6 - 5i}$.

The problem involves arranging 8 people around a circular table, with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We need to find the number of possible arrangements that satisfy this condition.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can treat the 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) as a single unit or ""block."" This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the 5 remaining individuals plus the block of 3) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange 6 units in a circle is $(6-1)! = 5!$.

Within the block of 3 people, there are $3!$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the units around the circle and the number of ways to arrange the people within the block:
\[ 5! \times 3! \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we calculate the value:
\[ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \]
\[ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \]
\[ 5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720 \]

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\).

To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

The general term in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^r\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\).

The general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{r} (10x^3)^{5-r} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^r\).

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the value of \(r\) for which the exponent of \(x\) in the term is zero. The exponent of \(x\) in the general term is given by \(3(5-r) - 2r = 15 - 3r - 2r = 15 - 5r\).

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:
\[15 - 5r = 0\]
\[5r = 15\]
\[r = 3\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(r = 3\).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we substitute \(r = 3\) into the general term to find the constant term:
\[\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\]
\[= \binom{5}{3} (10)^2 (x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 (x^2)^{-3}\]
\[= \binom{5}{3} (100) (x^6) \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) (x^{-6})\]

\[= \binom{5}{3} (100) \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) (x^0)\]
\[= \binom{5}{3} (100) \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) (1)\]
\[= 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)\]
\[= -\frac{1000}{8}\]

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

We can rewrite $n + 2$, $n + 4$, and $n + 6$ in terms of $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$:

Next action: [ADVANCE]
\nIn a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex. Let's assume the vertices are A(5, 3), B(6, 8), C(7, 4), and D(x, y). The midpoint of diagonal AC should be equal to the midpoint of diagonal BD.

\nThe midpoint of diagonal AC is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

\nThe midpoint of diagonal BD is:
\[

\nLet's assume the vertices are A(5, 3), B(6, 8), C(x, y), and D(7, 4). The midpoint of diagonal AC should be equal to the midpoint of diagonal BD.

Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. This simplifies to $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$.

We also know that $\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$. Using the relationship we found, $\tan A = \frac{2 \cdot \text{adjacent}}{\text{adjacent}} = 2$.

The problem involves finding the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ for the function $f(x)=\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$, where the graph of the function has vertical asymptotes at $x=a$ and $x=b$, and a horizontal asymptote at $y=c$. The objective is to find the sum $a+b+c$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of $x$ that make the denominator of the function equal to zero. The denominator of the function is $x^2-5x-14$. We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[x^2-5x-14 = (x-7)(x+2) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:
\[x-7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x+2 = 0,\]
which gives us the solutions:
\[x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.\]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at $x=7$ and $x=-2$, so we can let $a=7$ and $b=-2$.

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function $f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ depends on the degrees of the polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is at $y=0$. Therefore, we can let $c=0$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now that we have the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can calculate the sum $a+b+c$:
\[a+b+c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5.\]

This inequality involves the norm of a matrix-vector product, which can be related to the matrix's operator norm.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the matrix by \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The inequality can be rewritten as \( \|A\bold{v}\| \le C \|\bold{v}\| \) for all vectors \( \bold{v} \). The smallest such \( C \) is the operator norm of \( A \), which is the largest singular value of \( A \).

The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). We need to compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \( \det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0 \):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation, we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]
The largest eigenvalue is \( \lambda = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2} \). The largest singular value of \( A \) is the square root of this eigenvalue:

The volume $V$ of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. The rate of change of the volume with respect to time is $\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The rate of change of the height with respect to time is $\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$ meters per hour.

Using the chain rule, we can relate the rates of change of the volume and the height:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
Simplifying the equation, we can solve for $r^2$:
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2 \implies r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

[OUTPUT]

The radius of the tank is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$ meters.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a,
\end{cases}
\]
We need to find the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at most once.

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at most once, the function \( f(x) \) must be injective (one-to-one). This means that \( f(x) \) should be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

We need to analyze the behavior of the function on both sides of \( x = a \).

For \( x \geq a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax^2 \). For this to be strictly increasing, we need \( a > 0 \).

For \( x < a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). For this to be strictly increasing, we need \( a > 0 \).

Since both parts of the function need to be strictly increasing, we conclude that \( a > 0 \).

Next, we need to ensure that the function is continuous at \( x = a \) and that the values of the function on both sides of \( x = a \) do not intersect for any horizontal line.

[ADVANCE]

To ensure continuity at \( x = a \), we equate the two expressions of the function at \( x = a \):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \]
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a \]
Equating the two expressions, we get:
\[ a^3 = a^2 + 2a \]
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0 \]
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0 \]
This gives us \( a = 0 \), \( a = 2 \), or \( a = -1 \). Since we need \( a > 0 \), we consider \( a = 2 \).

We need to verify that \( a = 2 \) ensures that the function is injective and that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at most once.

[ADVANCE]

For \( a = 2 \), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]
We need to check that this function is injective. For \( x \geq 2 \), \( f(x) = 2x^2 \) is strictly increasing. For \( x < 2 \), \( f(x) = 2x + 4 \) is strictly increasing. We also need to check that the values of the function on both sides of \( x = 2 \) do not intersect for any horizontal line.

The value of the function at \( x = 2 \) is \( f(2) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8 \). For \( x < 2 \), the maximum value of \( f(x) \) is \( f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8 \). Since the function is strictly increasing on both sides and the values match at \( x = 2 \), the function is injective.

Therefore, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects each horizontal line at most once is \( \boxed{2} \).

The given equation of the circle is $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$. To find the value of $c$ for which the radius of the circle is 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.

[ADVANCE]

To rewrite the equation in standard form, we need to complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms.

1. Rearrange the equation: $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -c$.
2. Complete the square for the $x$ terms: $x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25$.
3. Complete the square for the $y$ terms: $y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9$.
4. Substitute the completed square terms back into the equation: $(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = -c$.
5. Simplify the equation: $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 = -c$.
6. Rearrange to get the standard form: $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c$.

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we have $r^2 = 1^2 = 1$. Therefore, we can set up the equation $34 - c = 1$.

[ADVANCE]

Solve for $c$: $34 - c = 1 \implies c = 34 - 1 \implies c = 33$.

So, the value of $c$ is $\boxed{33}$.

We need to find the value of $\lambda$ for which there exists some $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x$, where $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ and $0 \leq \lambda \leq 4$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, let's compute $f(f(x))$. We have:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
We need to find $x$ such that $f(f(x)) = x$. So, we set up the equation:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This equation is complex, so let's simplify it step by step.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the value of $\lambda$, we can start by considering the fixed points of the function $f(x)$. The fixed points are given by $f(x) = x$, which means:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$. Since $x \in [0,1]$, we need to ensure that $\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \in [0,1]$. For $\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \geq 0$, we need $\lambda \geq 1$. For $\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1$, we need $\lambda \geq 1$. So, the fixed points are $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$ for $\lambda \geq 1$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find $\lambda$ such that $f(f(x)) = x$ but $f(x) \neq x$. We can substitute $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ and check for which $\lambda$ this holds true. However, it's easier to first consider the case when $f(x) \neq x$ and then check the condition $f(f(x)) = x$.

Let's consider the case when $x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$. We can substitute $f(x) = y$ and then use the condition $f(y) = x$. This gives us a system of equations to solve.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can also analyze the function $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ and its range. Since $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ is a quadratic function, its maximum value occurs at $x = \frac{1}{2}$. The maximum value is:
\[f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}.\]
Since $f(x) \in [0,1]$ for $x \in [0,1]$, we must have $\frac{\lambda}{4} \leq 1$, which implies $\lambda \leq 4$.

Now, we need to find the specific value of $\lambda$ that satisfies the condition $f(f(x)) = x$ but $f(x) \neq x$. We can use the fact that $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ and substitute it into the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ to find the value of $\lambda$.

After solving the equation, we find that $\lambda = 2$ satisfies the condition.

The problem involves finding the value of $\theta$ for which the given expression for $\tan \theta$ holds true. The expression involves trigonometric functions of various angles, and we need to simplify it to find $\theta$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We start by simplifying the given expression for $\tan \theta$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
and
\[
\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B).
\]
We can rewrite the numerator as:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity $\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x$, we can rewrite $\cos 85^\circ$ as $\sin 5^\circ$. So the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity $\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x$, we can rewrite $\sin 85^\circ$ as $\cos 5^\circ$. So the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]
Now, the expression for $\tan \theta$ becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can further simplify this expression by dividing the numerator and the denominator by $\cos 25^\circ$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{1 + \tan 5^\circ}{\tan 25^\circ - 1}.
\]
We recognize that this expression can be simplified using the tangent addition formula. Recall that:
\[
\tan (A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.
\]
We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\tan 45^\circ + \tan 5^\circ}{1 - \tan 45^\circ \tan 5^\circ} = \tan (45^\circ + 5^\circ) = \tan 50^\circ.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 50^\circ.
\]
Since the tangent function is periodic with period $180^\circ$, the general solution for $\theta$ is:
\[
\theta = 50^\circ + 180^\circ k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
For the principal value of $\theta$, we take $k = 0$, so:
\[
\theta = 50^\circ.

The problem asks for the number of ways the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" can be arranged.

The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 7 letters: E, L, L, I, P, S, E.
There are repeated letters in the word, specifically 2 E's and 2 L's.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"", we use the formula for permutations of a multiset:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \(n\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"", we have:
- Total number of letters, \(n = 7\)
- Frequency of E, \(n_1 = 2\)
- Frequency of L, \(n_2 = 2\)
- Frequency of I, \(n_3 = 1\)
- Frequency of P, \(n_4 = 1\)
- Frequency of S, \(n_5 = 1\)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}

Next, we calculate the factorials:

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2

To solve this, we need to determine the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$. Since $10 = 2 \times 5$, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, we need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To count the number of times 5 is a factor in $42!$, we use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$, which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For $42!$ and $p = 5$, we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

The problem asks us to find the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let's substitute \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Using the substitution, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

We recognize that \( \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin (\theta + \phi) \). Therefore, the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

We also know that \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), so \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Similarly, \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \).

Therefore, the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) \) is achieved when \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \), and the maximum value is \( \boxed{1} \).

Let's denote $z + \frac{1}{z} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. We recognize that $a$ is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation $a^2 = a + 1$. We can use this property to find higher powers of $a$.

Next, we need to find a pattern in the powers of $z + \frac{1}{z}$. Let's calculate the next few powers:

\[ \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)^2 = z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 = a + 1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

So, we have:

\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Now, let's calculate $z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3}$:

\[ \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)\left(z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\right) = z^3 + z + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^3} = a \left(z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{5 - 1}{4} = 1. \]

So, we have:

\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = 1 - \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right) = 1 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We can continue this process to find a pattern. However, we can also use the fact that the sequence $z^n + \frac{1}{z^n}$ satisfies a recurrence relation. Let's denote $a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n}$. We have:

\[ a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad a_2 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad a_3 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We can use the recurrence relation $a_{n+1} = \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)a_n - a_{n-1} = a \cdot a_n - a_{n-1}$ to find higher terms.

[ADVANCE]

Let's calculate a few more terms to find the pattern:

\[ a_4 = a \cdot a_3 - a_2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - 5}{4} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-4}{4} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

\[ a_5 = a \cdot a_4 - a_3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - 2\sqrt{5} - 5}{4} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2. \]

\[ a_6 = a \cdot a_5 - a_4 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot (-2) - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-2 - 2\sqrt{5} + 1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We notice that $a_6 = a_4$. Let's calculate a few more terms to confirm the periodicity:

\[ a_7 = a \cdot a_6 - a_5 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - (-2) = \frac{-1 - 2\sqrt{5} - 5}{4} + 2 = \frac{-6 - 2\sqrt{5} + 8}{4} = \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

\[ a_8 = a \cdot a_7 - a_6 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - 5}{4} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-4}{4} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We see that the sequence $a_n$ is periodic with a period of 6. Therefore, we can reduce the exponent 85 modulo 6:

\[ 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{6}. \]

So, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. This means that $AG:GD = 2:1$, $BG:GE = 2:1$, and $CG:GF = 2:1$.

We also know that the area of a triangle formed by the centroid and two vertices of the original triangle is one-third of the area of the original triangle. Therefore, the area of triangle $BGC$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$, which is $\frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48$.

Since $M$ and $N$ are the points where the line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, triangle $AMN$ is similar to triangle $ABC$ and the ratio of their corresponding sides is $\frac{2}{3}$ (since $G$ divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio).

The area of triangle $AMN$ is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2$ of the area of triangle $ABC$, which is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 \times 144 = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64$.

Since triangle $ENG$ is part of triangle $AMN$ and $G$ is the centroid, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $AMN$, which is $\frac{1}{3} \times 64 = \frac{64}{3}$.

However, we can also consider the area of triangle $ENG$ in relation to the area of triangle $BGC$. Since $ENG$ is similar to $BGC$ and the ratio of their corresponding sides is $\frac{1}{3}$ (since $G$ divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, and we are considering the segment from $G$ to the sides of the triangle), the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2$ of the area of triangle $BGC$, which is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 \times 48 = \frac{1}{9} \times 48 = \frac{48}{9} = \frac{16}{3}$.

Therefore, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\boxed{\frac{16}{3}}$.

The problem involves finding the volume of a cone using the formula $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. We are given that the area of the base $B$ is 30 square units and the height $h$ is 6.5 units.

We can substitute the given values into the formula to find the volume of the cone. The formula is $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$, so we substitute $B = 30$ and $h = 6.5$:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]

Now, we can calculate the value of $V$.

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 195 \]
\[ V = 65 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence as \(a\) and the common difference as \(d\). The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

Given that the fourth term is 200, we can write:
\[a + 3d = 200 \quad \text{(1)}\]

Given that the eighth term is 500, we can write:
\[a + 7d = 500 \quad \text{(2)}\]

We can solve equations (1) and (2) to find the values of \(a\) and \(d\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \(a\):
\[(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find \(a\):
\[a + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a + 225 = 200\]
\[a = -25\]

Now that we have the first term \(a = -25\) and the common difference \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term of the sequence:
\[a_6 = a + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 375\]
\[a_6 = 350\]

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ into a decimal. To do this, we need to express the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10, which is $2 \cdot 5$. The denominator $2^2 \cdot 5^7$ can be rewritten as $2^2 \cdot 5^7 = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5^6 = 10 \cdot 5^6$. We can then adjust the numerator and denominator to achieve a denominator that is a power of 10.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the fraction as follows:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21}{10 \cdot 5^6} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{10 \cdot 5^6 \cdot 2^5} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}
\]
Now, we can express the fraction $\frac{672}{10^7}$ as a decimal by moving the decimal point 7 places to the left:

A number is a perfect $n$th power if it can be expressed as $a^n$ for some integer $a$. For $2^{24}$ to be a perfect $n$th power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, we need to find the number of divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

We are given a problem involving coins of different denominations: dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cent). The total value of the coins is 75 cents. We need to determine the number of nickels.

Let's denote:
- $d$ as the number of dimes,
- $n$ as the number of nickels,
- $p$ as the number of pennies.

The total value equation can be written as:
\[10d + 5n + p = 75.\]

Since we are asked to find the number of nickels, we need to express $n$ in terms of $d$ and $p$ or find a specific combination that satisfies the equation.

[ADVANCE]

We can start by considering the possible values of $d$ (number of dimes) and see how it affects the equation. Since the maximum value of a dime is 10 cents, we can have a maximum of 7 dimes (because $8 \times 10 = 80$ which exceeds 75 cents).

Let's iterate through possible values of $d$:

1. If $d = 0$, the equation becomes $5n + p = 75$. Since $p$ can be at most 75 (if $n = 0$), we need to find a combination of $n$ and $p$ that satisfies this equation.
2. If $d = 1$, the equation becomes $5n + p = 65$. Again, we need to find a combination of $n$ and $p$ that satisfies this equation.
3. If $d = 2$, the equation becomes $5n + p = 55$.
4. If $d = 3$, the equation becomes $5n + p = 45$.
5. If $d = 4$, the equation becomes $5n + p = 35$.
6. If $d = 5$, the equation becomes $5n + p = 25$.
7. If $d = 6$, the equation becomes $5n + p = 15$.
8. If $d = 7$, the equation becomes $5n + p = 5$.

We can see that for each of these equations, $p$ must be a non-negative integer that leaves a remainder when divided by 5, since $5n$ is always a multiple of 5.

[ADVANCE]

Let's consider the equation for $d = 0$: $5n + p = 75$. Here, $p$ can be 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, or 75. If $p = 0$, then $5n = 75$, so $n = 15$. This is a valid solution.

We can verify that this is the only solution by checking the other equations for $d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$. However, we can see that for each of these equations, the value of $n$ will be an integer only if $p$ is a multiple of 5, and we need to check if there are any other valid combinations.

But since the problem asks for the number of nickels, and we have found a valid solution for $d = 0$, we can conclude that the number of nickels is 15.

Therefore, the number of nickels is $\boxed{15}$.

The problem involves two individuals, Paul and Jenny, who each pick a prime number. We need to find the probability that the sum of the two picked prime numbers is even.

First, let's recall that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or odd. Since there is only one even prime number, which is 2, and all other prime numbers are odd, we can analyze the possible outcomes.

[ADVANCE]

1. If Paul picks the only even prime number 2, then Jenny must pick an odd prime number for the sum to be even. The probability of Paul picking 2 is $\frac{1}{\infty}$ (since there are infinitely many prime numbers), but for simplicity, let's assume we are considering a finite set of the first few prime numbers. However, in the context of this problem, we can consider the probability of Paul picking 2 and then Jenny picking an odd prime as $\frac{1}{\text{total prime numbers}} \times \frac{\text{odd prime numbers}}{\text{total prime numbers}}$.
2. If Paul picks an odd prime number, then Jenny must pick an odd prime number as well for the sum to be even. The probability of Paul picking an odd prime number is $\frac{\text{odd prime numbers}}{\text{total prime numbers}}$, and the probability of Jenny picking an odd prime number is also $\frac{\text{odd prime numbers}}{\text{total prime numbers}}$.

Since there are infinitely many prime numbers, we can consider the probability of picking an odd prime number as $\frac{\text{odd prime numbers}}{\text{total prime numbers}} = \frac{\infty - 1}{\infty} = 1 - \frac{1}{\infty} \approx 1$ (since the number of odd primes is infinite and the number of even primes is 1).

However, to solve this problem in a more general and simpler way, we can consider the fact that the only even prime number is 2, and all other primes are odd. So, the probability that the sum of the two picked prime numbers is even can be calculated as the probability that both pick odd primes plus the probability that both pick the even prime 2.

Since the probability of picking the even prime 2 is very low compared to picking an odd prime, we can simplify the calculation by considering the probability of both picking odd primes.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that Paul picks an odd prime is $\frac{\infty - 1}{\infty} \approx 1$, and the probability that Jenny picks an odd prime is also $\frac{\infty - 1}{\infty} \approx 1$. Therefore, the probability that both pick odd primes is approximately $1 \times 1 = 1$.

However, we need to consider the probability of the sum being even, which includes the case where both pick the even prime 2. The probability of Paul picking 2 is $\frac{1}{\infty}$, and the probability of Jenny picking 2 is also $\frac{1}{\infty}$. Therefore, the probability that both pick 2 is $\frac{1}{\infty} \times \frac{1}{\infty} = \frac{1}{\infty^2}$, which is negligible.

So, the total probability that the sum of the two picked prime numbers is even is approximately the probability that both pick odd primes, which is $1 \times \frac{\infty - 1}{\infty} = \frac{\infty - 1}{\infty} \approx 1$.

However, to present the answer in a more precise and simplified manner, we can consider the probability in a finite set of prime numbers. Let's assume we have the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,....

The probability that Paul picks an odd prime is $\frac{\text{number of odd primes}}{\text{total number of primes}}$, and the probability that Jenny picks an odd prime is the same. The probability that Paul picks 2 is $\frac{1}{\text{total number of primes}}$, and the probability that Jenny picks 2 is also $\frac{1}{\text{total number of primes}}$.

If we consider the first few prime numbers, the probability that the sum is even can be calculated as:

\[ P(\text{sum is even}) = P(\text{both pick odd primes}) + P(\text{both pick 2}) = \left(\frac{\text{number of odd primes}}{\text{total number of primes}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\text{total number of primes}}\right)^2 \]

As the number of prime numbers increases, the probability of both picking odd primes approaches 1, and the probability of both picking 2 approaches 0.

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two picked prime numbers is even is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.

The problem asks for the smallest positive factor of 450 whose digits are only 0 and 1.

First, we need to find the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

Next, we need to check the factors of 450 to find the smallest factor that consists only of the digits 0 and 1.

We can start by checking the smallest numbers consisting only of the digits 0 and 1, which are 1, 10, 11, 100, etc.

[ADVANCE]

We will check each of these numbers to see if they are factors of 450.

1. Check if 1 is a factor of 450: Yes, 1 is a factor of every number.
2. Check if 10 is a factor of 450: Yes, \(450 \div 10 = 45\), so 10 is a factor of 450.
3. Check if 11 is a factor of 450: No, \(450 \div 11 = 40.909\), so 11 is not a factor of 450.
4. Check if 100 is a factor of 450: No, \(450 \div 100 = 4.5\), so 100 is not a factor of 450.

Since 10 is the smallest number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1 that is a factor of 450, we can conclude that the answer is 10.

The smallest positive factor of 450 whose digits are only 0 and 1 is \(\boxed{10}\).

The problem involves a chessboard with numbers from 1 to 9, and we need to find the probability of a check being placed on a specific square based on the rules provided.

The chessboard layout is as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
7 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The first step is to determine the possible outcomes for the first and second dice rolls, and then find the corresponding column and row numbers.

The first die roll (divided by 4) determines the column:
- If the first die roll is 1 or 5, the column is 1 (corresponding to numbers 1, 4, 7).
- If the first die roll is 2 or 6, the column is 2 (corresponding to numbers 2, 5, 8).
- If the first die roll is 3 or 9, the column is 3 (corresponding to numbers 3, 6, 9).

The second die roll (divided by 5) determines the row:
- If the second die roll is 1 or 6, the row is 1 (corresponding to numbers 1, 2, 3).
- If the second die roll is 2 or 7, the row is 2 (corresponding to numbers 4, 5, 6).
- If the second die roll is 3 or 8, the row is 3 (corresponding to numbers 7, 8, 9).

We need to find the probability that the check is placed on the square at the intersection of the column and row determined by the dice rolls.

Let's calculate the probability step by step.

[ADVANCE]

The probability of the first die roll determining a specific column is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$ for each column, since there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each column.

The probability of the second die roll determining a specific row is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$ for each row, since there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each row.

Since the column and row are determined independently, the probability of the check being placed on a specific square is the product of the probabilities of the column and row being determined.

There are 9 possible squares on the chessboard, and each square has an equal probability of being chosen. Therefore, the probability of the check being placed on any specific square is $\frac{1}{9}$.

The answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{9}}$.

The problem requires us to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$.

To solve this, we need to first simplify the fraction by converting the denominator to a power of 10, which will allow us to express the fraction as a decimal.

The denominator is $5^7 \cdot 2^8$. We can rewrite this as $5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2$.

So, the fraction becomes $\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 2160.5 \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 0.00021605$.

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation $0.00021605$.

[ADVANCE]

The decimal representation is $0.00021605$. To find the sum of the digits, we ignore the decimal point and add the digits together: $0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5$.

Let's calculate the sum: $0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14$.

So, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction is $\boxed{14}$.

The problem requires finding the value of the product $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ$. We can use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to rewrite the expression in terms of sines of angles less than $90^\circ$. This gives us:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 \sin 80^\circ.
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Substituting this value, we get:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \sin 80^\circ = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \sin 80^\circ.
\]
Next, we can use the identity $\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)$ to rewrite $\sin 80^\circ$ as $\cos 10^\circ$. However, to simplify the expression further, we can use the product-to-sum identities or the identity for the product of sines. We can use the identity:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x-y) - \cos (x+y)].
\]
We can also use the identity for the product of four sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) \sin y = \frac{1}{16} (\sin 4x) (\sin 4y).
\]
However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of $\sin \frac{k\pi}{n}$ for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$ is given by:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sin \frac{k\pi}{n} = \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}.
\]
For $n = 9$, we have:
\[
\sin \frac{\pi}{9} \sin \frac{2\pi}{9} \sin \frac{3\pi}{9} \sin \frac{4\pi}{9} \sin \frac{5\pi}{9} \sin \frac{6\pi}{9} \sin \frac{7\pi}{9} \sin \frac{8\pi}{9} = \frac{9}{2^8}.
\]
We can rewrite the angles in terms of degrees:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{9}{2^8} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]
Since $\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ$, the product is symmetric and we can simplify it to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{9}{256}.
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \sqrt{\frac{9}{256}} = \frac{3}{16}.
\]
Therefore, the value of the given expression is:

The problem is asking for the shape described by the equation $z = c$ in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta, z)$.

In cylindrical coordinates, $r$ is the radial distance from the $z$-axis, $\theta$ is the angular coordinate in the $xy$-plane, and $z$ is the height above the $xy$-plane. The equation $z = c$ implies that the height above the $xy$-plane is constant.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since the height $z$ is constant, the shape described by the equation $z = c$ is independent of the values of $r$ and $\theta$. This means that the shape extends infinitely in the radial direction ($r$) and angular direction ($\theta$), but remains at a fixed height ($z$).

Therefore, the shape described by the equation $z = c$ is a horizontal plane or a sheet parallel to the $xy$-plane, which is also known as a cylindrical surface or a plane surface in 3D space.

We are given the magnitudes of vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ as $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2$ and $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7$, respectively. We are also given the cross product of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ as $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$. We need to find the angle between vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
[ADVANCE]

The angle $\theta$ whose sine is $\frac{1}{2}$ is $\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)$. We know that $\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{2}$, so:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}.
\]
To convert this to degrees, we use the fact that $\pi$ radians is equal to $180^\circ$, so:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 30^\circ.

We are given a function $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ and a new function $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

The function $g(x)$ is a transformation of the function $f(x)$, where the input $x$ is shifted by 5 units to the left. This means that the roots of $g(x)$ are 5 units less than the roots of $f(x)$.

Let's denote the roots of $f(x)$ as $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$. Then the roots of $g(x)$ will be $r_1 - 5$, $r_2 - 5$, and $r_3 - 5$.

According to Vieta's formulas for the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is given by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term with a changed sign. Therefore, the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is $49$.

[ADVANCE]

Since the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5$, $r_2 - 5$, and $r_3 - 5$, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ will be $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15$. We already know that $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49$, so the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 15 = 34$.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $\boxed{34}$.

The problem requires us to compute the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

We need to simplify this expression step by step.

[ADVANCE]

We can start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\). So the expression becomes \(\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ\).

We know that \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\). We can use these identities to rewrite the expression.

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ
\]
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\).

We can use the identity \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) in terms of tangent.

\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 70^\circ
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

We know that \(\tan 10^\circ\), \(\tan 50^\circ\), and \(\tan 70^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0\) (this can be derived using the triple angle formula for tangent).

Using the identity \(\tan (90^\circ - x) = \cot x\), we can also use the fact that \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ = \tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ = 1\).

We can use the identity \((\tan 10^\circ + \tan 50^\circ + \tan 70^\circ)^2 = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + 2(\tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ + \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ + \tan 70^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\).

From the equation \(x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0\), we know that \(\tan 10^\circ + \tan 50^\circ + \tan 70^\circ = 0\).

So, \((\tan 10^\circ + \tan 50^\circ + \tan 70^\circ)^2 = 0\), which implies \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = -2(\tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ + \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ + \tan 70^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\).

We also know that \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ = 1\), so \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ + \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ + \tan 70^\circ \tan 10^\circ = \tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ \left(\frac{1}{\tan 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan 50^\circ}\right) = 1 \cdot (\tan 10^\circ + \tan 50^\circ + \tan 70^\circ) = 0\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9\).

The problem involves finding the number of sides in a polygon given the sum of the interior angles and one exterior angle. We know that the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ$. We also know that the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^\circ$. Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$ and the measure of the given exterior angle as $x$. The measure of the corresponding interior angle would then be $180^\circ - x$.

Given that the sum of the interior angles is $1070^\circ$ and one of the interior angles is $180^\circ - x$, we can set up the equation:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1070 + x
\]

Since the sum of the exterior angles is $360^\circ$, we have:

\[
x + (n-1) \cdot x' = 360
\]

where $x'$ is the measure of the other exterior angles. However, we can simplify our approach by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles is given and the relationship between interior and exterior angles.

We can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles to find $n$:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1070 + x
\]

We also know that the sum of all exterior angles is $360^\circ$, so:

\[
x + (n-1) \cdot \left(180 - \frac{1070}{n-1}\right) = 360
\]

However, we can use a simpler approach. The sum of the interior angles is $1070^\circ$ and the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ$. We can set up the equation:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 - x = 1070
\]

And we know that the sum of the exterior angles is $360^\circ$, so:

\[
x = 360 - (n-1) \cdot \text{(other exterior angles)}
\]

Since we don't have the value of the other exterior angles, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles is $1070^\circ$ and the formula for the sum of the interior angles to find $n$:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1070 + x
\]

We can express $x$ as:

\[
x = 180 - \text{interior angle}
\]

Let's solve for $n$:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1070 + (180 - \text{interior angle})

Since we don't have the value of the interior angle, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles is $1070^\circ$ and the formula for the sum of the interior angles to find $n$:

Let's solve for $n$:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1070 + x
\]

We can express $x$ as:

\[
x = 360 - \frac{360n - 720}{n}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
x = \frac{360n - 720 - 360n + 720}{n}
\]

\[
x = \frac{720 - 360}{n}
\]

\[
x = \frac{360}{n}
\]

Substituting $x$ in the equation:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1070 + \frac{360}{n}
\]

Multiplying both sides by $n$:

\[
180n^2 - 360n = 1070n + 360
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
180n^2 - 1430n - 360 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 180$, $b = -1430$, and $c = -360$:

\[
n = \frac{1430 \pm \sqrt{(-1430)^2 - 4 \cdot 180 \cdot (-360)}}{2 \cdot 180}
\]

\[
n = \frac{1430 \pm \sqrt{2044900 + 259200}}{360}
\]

\[
n = \frac{1430 \pm \sqrt{2304100}}{360}
\]

\[
n = \frac{1430 \pm 1518}{360}
\]

We have two possible solutions:

\[
n = \frac{1430 + 1518}{360} = \frac{2948}{360} = 8.188 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

\[
n = \frac{1430 - 1518}{360} = \frac{-88}{360} = -0.244 \quad \text{(not a positive integer)}
\]

However, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles is $(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1070 + x$ and the sum of the exterior angles is $360^\circ$ to find $n$:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1070 + (180 - \frac{1070}{n-1})
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 = 1250 - \frac{1070}{n-1}
\]

Multiplying both sides by $n-1$:

\[
180(n-2)(n-1) = 1250(n-1) - 1070
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
180n^2 - 540n + 360 = 1250n - 1250 - 1070
\]

\[
180n^2 - 1790n + 2680 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 180$, $b = -1790$, and $c = 2680$:

We need to find a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the congruence as:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
This can be rearranged into a standard quadratic form:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

We can check the squares of integers from 0 to 22 to find the value of \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \):
\[ \begin{aligned}
&0^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}, \\
&1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
&2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\

&10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
&11^2 \equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.
\end{aligned} \]
We see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
or
\[ t \equiv -1 - 5 \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer, we discard \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \) and keep \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

The unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is \( \boxed{17} \).

The problem involves finding the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot. We need to convert the volume to a side length, and then calculate the surface area.

[ADVANCE]

1. First, we need to find the side length of the cube. Since the volume of the cube is 1 cubic foot, we can use the formula for the volume of a cube: \( V = s^3 \), where \( s \) is the side length. So, \( s = \sqrt[3]{V} = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \) foot.
2. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the side length of the cube in inches is \( s = 1 \text{ foot} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 12 \text{ inches} \).
3. The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula: \( A = 6s^2 \), where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Substituting the side length in inches, we get \( A = 6 \times (12)^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864 \) square inches.

For the given sequence of odd numbers, the first term $a_1$ is 1, and the common difference $d$ is 2.

We need to find the 2003rd term, so we substitute $n = 2003$, $a_1 = 1$, and $d = 2$ into the formula:

The given equation is \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). We need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\). Therefore, the equation can be simplified to:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Using the double-angle identity for sine, we have:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2}
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can solve the equation \(\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}\) by cross-multiplying:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[

\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}

The problem involves finding the shortest distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The lines are defined by their direction vectors and points on the lines.

The first line is given by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
The second line is given by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Since the lines are parallel, their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

[ADVANCE]

To find the shortest distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula:
\[d = \frac{\left|(\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1}) \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{b})\right|}{\left\| \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{b} \right\|}.\]
However, since the direction vectors are the same (ignoring the scalar multiple), the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{b}\) will be the zero vector. Instead, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines:
\[d = \frac{\left|(\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1}) \cdot \mathbf{b}\right|}{\left\| \mathbf{b} \right\|},\]
where \(\mathbf{a_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a_2} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we calculate \(\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1}\):
\[\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Next, we calculate the dot product \((\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1}) \cdot \mathbf{b}\):
\[\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = (-8)(2) + (7)(-9) + (5)(-2) = -16 - 63 - 10 = -89.\]

Then, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[\left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.\]

Finally, we calculate the distance \(d\):
\[d = \frac{\left| -89 \right|}{\sqrt{89}} = \frac{89}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{89}.\]

So, the shortest distance between the two parallel lines is \(\boxed{\sqrt{89}}\).

\]
We need to use the properties of the cross product to expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$.

[ADVANCE]

We can expand the expression using the distributive property of the cross product:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
Using the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, we get:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}).
\]
Since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, the expression simplifies to:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]
We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so we can substitute the given values:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Substituting $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$, we get:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \left(-\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\right) - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Now, we can perform the scalar multiplications and additions:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Adding the vectors component-wise, we get:
\[

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$. The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is given as 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$, we can use the angle bisector theorem and properties of right triangles to solve the problem. Let's denote the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$ and the length of $\overline{CD}$ as $a$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of both $\triangle ACD$ and the trapezoid $ABCD$, we can express the area of the trapezoid in terms of $h$ and the lengths of the parallel sides.

Let the length of $\overline{AD}$ be $b$ and the length of $\overline{BC}$ be $c$. The area of the trapezoid is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (b + c) \times h = 42
\]
We also know that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, we can use the angle bisector theorem which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{AC}{AC} = \frac{b}{c} = \frac{h}{h} = 1
\]
This implies that $b = h$ and $c = h + a$. Substituting these values into the area equation of the trapezoid, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (h + (h + a)) \times h = 42
\]
Simplifying the equation, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (2h + a) \times h = 42
\]
\[
(2h + a) \times h = 84
\]
\[
2h^2 + ah = 84

The area of $\triangle ACD$ is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
We need to express $a$ in terms of $h$ to find the area of $\triangle ACD$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of $\triangle ACD$, we can use the fact that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is part of the total area of the trapezoid. Let's solve for $[\triangle ACD]$.

[ADVANCE]

From the equation $2h^2 + ah = 84$, we can express $a$ as:
\[
a = \frac{84 - 2h^2}{h}
\]
Substituting this value of $a$ into the area formula of $\triangle ACD$, we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \left(\frac{84 - 2h^2}{h}\right) \times h
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (84 - 2h^2)
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] = 42 - h^2
\]
We also know that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$. Since $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ share the same height $h$, the ratio of their areas is the ratio of their bases. Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is equal to the ratio of $BC$ to $AD$, which is equal to the ratio of $h + a$ to $h$. Therefore, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{h + a}{h} \times [\triangle ACD]
\]
Since the area of the trapezoid is 42, we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] + \frac{h + a}{h} \times [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] \left(1 + \frac{h + a}{h}\right) = 42
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] \left(\frac{2h + a}{h}\right) = 42
\]
We know that $2h^2 + ah = 84$, so $\frac{2h + a}{h} = \frac{84}{h^2}$. Substituting this value, we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] \times \frac{84}{h^2} = 42
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42h^2}{84}
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{h^2}{2}
\]
We also have $42 - h^2 = \frac{h^2}{2}$. Solving for $h^2$, we get:
\[
42 = \frac{3h^2}{2}
\]
\[
84 = 3h^2
\]
\[
h^2 = 28
\]
Substituting $h^2 = 28$ into the equation for the area of $\triangle ACD$, we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{h^2}{2} = \frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

The area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\boxed{14}$.

The problem is to solve for \( x \) in the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To solve for \( x \), we can start by squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

Rearranging the terms gives:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

\[
-19x = -9
\]

Dividing both sides by \(-19\) yields:

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Next action: [VERIFY]
We need to ensure that the solution \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) satisfies the original equation and that the steps taken are valid. We also need to check that the expression inside the square roots is non-negative.

Substituting \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27-19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

The solution \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) satisfies the original equation. Additionally, we need to check that the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative:

\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} > 0

\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - 1 = \frac{27-19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0

We will substitute the given fractions into the custom operation. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Now, we can calculate $\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21}$ using the given formula:

The problem involves finding the probability that the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are four randomly and independently chosen points on the circumference of a circle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect, we need to consider the order in which the points are arranged on the circle. The key insight is that the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are arranged in an alternating order, i.e., the order is either $ACBD$ or $ADBC$.

Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, we can assume that the probability of any particular ordering of the points is the same. There are $4! = 24$ possible orderings of the four points.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to count the number of orderings in which the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect. As mentioned earlier, the line segments intersect if and only if the points are in an alternating order. There are exactly 2 such alternating orders: $ACBD$ and $ADBC$. However, we also need to consider the reverse of these orders, which are $DBCA$ and $CBAD$, respectively. Therefore, there are a total of 2 (for $ACBD$ and $ADBC$) $\times$ 2 (for the reverse orders) = 4 favorable orderings.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The probability that the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable orderings divided by the total number of possible orderings. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{4}{24} = \frac{1}{6}$.

The problem requires us to find the value of the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\).

We can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine to simplify the expression. The angle sum identity for sine is \(\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), and the angle difference identity for sine is \(\sin (A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B\).

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are in the range of the arcsin function, which is \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\), the cosine values will be non-negative. Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\), we get \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we can use the angle sum and difference identities:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]

The expression we need to evaluate is:
\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4) = \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10} \right)
\]

This is a difference of squares:
\[
\left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{21})^2}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -\frac{9}{100}

We can simplify the second equation to find the sum of the integers:

1. $abc = 120$
2. $a + b + c = 15$

We need to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy both equations.

The problem involves solving the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$ for positive values of $x$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can rewrite the expression inside the cube root as a perfect square: $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2$. So the equation becomes $\sqrt[3]{(x-2)^2} = 16$.

Next, we can eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation: $(x-2)^2 = 16^3$.

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side: $(x-2)^2 = 4096$.

To solve for $x$, we take the square root of both sides: $x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}$. Since $\sqrt{4096} = 64$, we have $x-2 = \pm 64$.

This gives us two possible solutions: $x-2 = 64$ and $x-2 = -64$. Solving for $x$ in each case, we get $x = 66$ and $x = -62$.

The problem states that the sum of 27 positive integers is $3^7$. We need to find the mean of these 27 integers.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the 27 positive integers is given as $3^7$. To find the mean, we need to divide the sum by the number of integers, which is 27.

The mean can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the integers}}{\text{Number of integers}} = \frac{3^7}{27}
\]

Since $27 = 3^3$, we can simplify the expression:
\[

The problem requires finding the real values of $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds true. We need to break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one step-by-step.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factorize the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true.

The roots of the equation $(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0$ are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we know that $y \geq 0$. Therefore, we only consider the interval where $y$ is non-negative. The inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ holds true when $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2$ and $y \geq 0$, we have $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which implies $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factorized as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2$ is always non-negative and greater than 0 for all real $x$ (except when $x^2 + 2 = 0$, which has no real solutions), this inequality holds true for all real $x$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. The solution to the first inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, and the solution to the second inequality is all real $x$. Therefore, the intersection of these solutions is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z &= 12.
\end{align*}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$ and $xyz = 4,$ we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we need to express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in terms of $xy + yz + zx.$ We can use the identity:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $x + y + z$ by $p$ and $xy + yz + zx$ by $q.$ Then, we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = p^2 - 2q.\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 2q - q) = p(p^2 - 3q).\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We also know the identity:
\[(xy + yz + zx)^2 = x^2y^2 + y^2z^2 + z^2x^2 + 2xyz(x + y + z).\]
We can rewrite the given equation $xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12$ as:
\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.\]
This can be expressed as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can also write:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[12 = p \cdot q - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to:
\[12 = pq - 12,\]
and further simplifies to:
\[pq = 24.\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We now have two equations:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q)\]
and
\[pq = 24.\]
We can express $q$ in terms of $p$ from the second equation:
\[q = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = p\left(p^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{p}\right) = p(p^2 - \frac{72}{p}) = p^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to:
\[p^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which further simplifies to:
\[p^3 = 64.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[p = 4.\]
Now, we can find $q$:
\[q = \frac{24}{p} = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $q = 6.$

We need to find the class for which the number of male students taking the bus is 135% of the number of female students taking the bus.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the class that satisfies the condition, we need to calculate the number of male and female students taking the bus for each class and then check if the number of male students taking the bus is 135% of the number of female students taking the bus.

Let's calculate the number of male and female students taking the bus for each class:

1. For the 9th class:
   - Number of male students taking the bus = $41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123$
   - Number of female students taking the bus = $39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118$

2. For the 10th class:
   - Number of male students taking the bus = $34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103$
   - Number of female students taking the bus = $33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99$

3. For the 11th class:
   - Number of male students taking the bus = $20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62$
   - Number of female students taking the bus = $13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41$

4. For the 12th class:
   - Number of male students taking the bus = $11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35$
   - Number of female students taking the bus = $8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26$

Now, we need to check which class satisfies the condition that the number of male students taking the bus is 135% of the number of female students taking the bus.

Let's calculate 135% of the number of female students taking the bus for each class and compare it with the number of male students taking the bus:

1. For the 9th class:
   - $135\% \times 118 = 1.35 \times 118 = 159.3 \neq 123$

2. For the 10th class:
   - $135\% \times 99 = 1.35 \times 99 = 133.65 \neq 103$

3. For the 11th class:
   - $135\% \times 41 = 1.35 \times 41 = 55.35 \neq 62$

4. For the 12th class:
   - $135\% \times 26 = 1.35 \times 26 = 35.1 \approx 35$

The 12th class satisfies the condition that the number of male students taking the bus is approximately 135% of the number of female students taking the bus.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

First, let's analyze the numerator and the denominator separately.

The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\). The absolute value is always non-negative, so \(|x^2 - 81| \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). The only time the numerator is zero is when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = \pm 9\).

The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\), which is a quadratic expression that can be zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\).

[ADVANCE]

Since the numerator is always non-negative, the sign of the fraction \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is determined by the sign of the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\), except when the denominator is zero, because division by zero is undefined.

We need to find the intervals where \(x^2 - 36x < 0\), because the numerator is non-negative and we want the fraction to be less than zero.

The inequality \(x^2 - 36x < 0\) can be rewritten as \(x(x - 36) < 0\). This inequality holds when \(0 < x < 36\), because the product of \(x\) and \(x-36\) is negative in this interval.

However, we must exclude the values \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) from the solution set because they make the denominator zero.

Additionally, we need to check the points where the numerator is zero, i.e., \(x = \pm 9\), to ensure they are not included in the solution set. Since the inequality is strict (< 0), the points where the numerator is zero do not affect the solution set.

[SYNTHESIZE]

Combining the information, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is the interval where the denominator is negative, excluding the points where the denominator is zero.

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\), excluding \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), and including no additional points from the numerator being zero.

The final answer is \(\boxed{(0, 36)}\).

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ and we know that $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the length of the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ has length 2 and the hypotenuse has length 5.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this length as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle $T$, the opposite side is the side that we found to have length $\sqrt{21}$, and the hypotenuse is 5. Therefore, $\sin T = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The problem asks for the minimum distance between the origin and the point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. The distance between the origin and any point $(x, y)$ on the graph can be expressed using the distance formula: $D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. To find the minimum distance, we need to express $y$ in terms of $x$ using the given equation of the graph and then minimize the distance function.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)$. Substituting this into the distance formula, we get:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}. \]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the function inside the square root, which is $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$. We take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0. \]
This gives us the critical points $x = 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$, and $x = -\sqrt{2}$. We need to evaluate the second derivative to determine the nature of these critical points:
\[ f''(x) = 6x^2 - 4. \]
Evaluating the second derivative at the critical points, we get:
\[ f''(0) = -4 < 0, \]
\[ f''(\sqrt{2}) = 6(\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 > 0, \]
\[ f''(-\sqrt{2}) = 6(-\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 > 0. \]
Since $f''(\sqrt{2}) > 0$ and $f''(-\sqrt{2}) > 0$, the function $f(x)$ has local minima at $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $x = -\sqrt{2}$. We can now find the corresponding $y$-coordinates by substituting these $x$-values into the equation of the graph:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \]
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
So, the points on the graph are $(\sqrt{2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$ and $(-\sqrt{2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$. We can now calculate the distance from the origin to these points:
\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}. \]
The minimum distance is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$, which is in the form $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$ where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The minimum distance between the origin and the point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. Therefore, the values of $a$ and $b$ are 10 and 2, respectively, and the sum $a+b$ is $\boxed{12}$.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x = 0 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \), we discard it. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \), we get:
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \implies x = 3 \text{ or } x = -1. \]
Since neither \( x = 3 \) nor \( x = -1 \) is in the domain \( x > 3 \), we discard both of them. Therefore, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation, but it's not necessary since we already found a solution \( x = -3 \) for the other part of the piecewise function. We can verify that there are no other real solutions for \( x > 3 \) by analyzing the cubic function or using numerical methods, but for the purpose of this problem, we can proceed with the solution we have.

Therefore, the only solutions to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can find the value of \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):

A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. Let the distances from point $P$ to the vertices be $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$, where $a = 3, b = 7, c = 8, d = 9,$ and $e = 11$. We need to find the value of $f$.

The sum of the squares of the distances is given by:
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = \text{constant}\]

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is the same. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices.

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to $\frac{4}{3}$ times the sum of the squares of the edge lengths of the octahedron. But we don't need that here, we can simply use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant.

Let's calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, we can set up the equation:
\[324 + f^2 = \text{constant}\]

We know that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is the same, so we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. But we can simply use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant.

Since we don't have the value of the constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is the same. We can assume that the constant is the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices, which is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices.

The problem involves comparing the acceleration of Jerry's golf ball and Jack's baseball. We are given the masses of the softball and the baseball, and we need to find the ratio of Jerry's golf ball's acceleration to Jack's baseball's acceleration.

According to Newton's second law, the force applied to an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration. Since the force applied to both balls is the same (the force of the kick), we can set up the following equation:

\[ F = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Given:
\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ grams} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ grams} \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jerry's golf ball to Jack's baseball:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{golf ball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{golf ball}}} \]

Since the mass of the golf ball is not given, we assume it is the same as the mass of the softball, which is a common scenario in such problems. So, we can use the mass of the softball as the mass of the golf ball for the calculation.

\[ \frac{a_{\text{golf ball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{150 \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ grams}} = \frac{3}{4} \]

We need to convert the decimal number $629_{10}$ to its representations in base 7 and base 8, and then compare the digits in these representations to find the number of matching digits.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, let's convert $629_{10}$ to base 7.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
\begin{aligned}
629 \div 7 &= 89 \text{ remainder } 6 \\
89 \div 7 &= 12 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
12 \div 7 &= 1 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
1 \div 7 &= 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the base 7 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1556_7$.

Next, let's convert $629_{10}$ to base 8.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 8, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
\begin{aligned}
629 \div 8 &= 78 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
78 \div 8 &= 9 \text{ remainder } 6 \\
9 \div 8 &= 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
1 \div 8 &= 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the base 8 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1165_8$.

Now, we need to compare the digits of $1556_7$ and $1165_8$ to find the number of matching digits.

The digits of $1556_7$ are 1, 5, 5, 6.
The digits of $1165_8$ are 1, 1, 6, 5.

We can see that the digits 1, 5, and 6 appear in both representations. Therefore, the number of matching digits is 3.

The problem involves a meeting of magicianicians and magicians, with a specific rule about handshakes. We need to determine the total number of handshakes that occur at the meeting.

Let's denote the number of magicianicians as $m$ and the number of magicians as $n$. According to the problem, each magicianician shakes hands with every other magicianician, and each magician shakes hands with every magicianician, but not with other magicians.

The number of handshakes among magicianicians is given by the combination formula $\binom{m}{2} = \frac{m(m-1)}{2}$.

The number of handshakes between magicians and magicianicians is given by the product of the number of magicians and the number of magicianicians, which is $mn$.

Therefore, the total number of handshakes is the sum of these two quantities: $\frac{m(m-1)}{2} + mn$.

We are given that the total number of participants is 100, so $m + n = 100$. We can express $n$ as $n = 100 - m$ and substitute this into the expression for the total number of handshakes.

The total number of handshakes is:
\[
\frac{m(m-1)}{2} + m(100 - m) = \frac{m(m-1)}{2} + 100m - m^2 = \frac{m^2 - m + 200m - 2m^2}{2} = \frac{-m^2 + 199m}{2}
\]

To find the maximum number of handshakes, we can complete the square or use calculus, but since the problem does not ask for the maximum, we can simply express the total number of handshakes in terms of $m$ and $n$.

However, we can also reason that the problem is asking for a specific number, so we should consider the given information and the nature of the problem. The problem does not provide specific values for $m$ and $n$, but it implies that we should find a general solution or a specific numerical answer.

Given the symmetry and the nature of the problem, we can assume that the problem is designed to have a specific numerical answer that does not depend on the specific values of $m$ and $n$, as long as $m + n = 100$.

Let's consider the case where $m = 50$ and $n = 50$. The number of handshakes among magicianicians is $\binom{50}{2} = \frac{50 \cdot 49}{2} = 1225$. The number of handshakes between magicians and magicianicians is $50 \cdot 50 = 2500$. The total number of handshakes is $1225 + 2500 = 3725$.

[ADVANCE]

To find $g(x)$, we need to substitute $x-1$ for $x$ in the polynomial $f(x)$. So, we have:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial $p(x)$ is equal to $p(1)$. Therefore, to find the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$, we need to evaluate $g(1)$.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting $x = 1$ into the expression for $g(x)$, we get:
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we need to evaluate $f(0)$ using the original polynomial $f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2$:
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line equation is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(6, 0)$, so $x_1 = 6$ and $y_1 = 0$. Now we can substitute these values into the distance formula.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
Substituting the values into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

The problem involves finding the product of the roots of the given polynomial equation $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. We need to determine the sets of products of the roots taken two at a time.

[ADVANCE]

The given polynomial equation is $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. According to Vieta's formulas for a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k = 0$, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is given by $\frac{c}{a}$, where $c$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-2}$ term and $a$ is the leading coefficient.

For the given polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$, the coefficient of $x^2$ is 0. Therefore, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is 0.

Let the roots be $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$. We need to find the set $\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}$.

Since the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is 0, we can write:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
We can express the desired set in terms of the sum of all products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3),
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = -(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3),

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = -(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4).
\]
Since the sum of all products of the roots taken two at a time is 0, we can see that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.

Let's denote the cost of one pencil as $p$ and the cost of one jar of jam as $j$. We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

\[

Our objective is to solve for $p$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the region within the rectangle where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices. This region is defined by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting the center to each vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will form a smaller rectangle whose center is also $O$. The sides of this smaller rectangle will be half the length of the diagonals of the rectangles formed by the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle.

The distance from the center $O$ to any vertex is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{AB}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{AD}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2}$. The distance from the center $O$ to the midpoint of any side is $\frac{1}{2}AB$ or $\frac{1}{2}AD$.

The region where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any vertex is a square whose side length is the minimum of these distances. Since $AB/AD = k$, we can let $AB = kx$ and $AD = x$. The distance from the center to any vertex is $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(kx)^2 + x^2} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{k^2x^2 + x^2} = \frac{x}{2}\sqrt{k^2 + 1}$.

The side length of the square region is $\frac{x}{2}\sqrt{k^2 + 1} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{x}{2}\sqrt{\frac{k^2 + 1}{2}}$.

The area of the smaller square is $\left(\frac{x}{2}\sqrt{\frac{k^2 + 1}{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2}{8}(k^2 + 1)$.

The area of the original rectangle is $AB \cdot AD = kx \cdot x = kx^2$.

The probability that a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle:

\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The total score of the 8 students who scored 90 is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The total score of the 2 students who scored 100 is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

The total score of all 30 students is:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Now, we can calculate the average score by dividing the total score by the number of students:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

The average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).

The problem involves comparing the distances traveled by Jim and Martha in the stadium. Jim runs along the diagonal of the rectangular field, while Martha runs along the length and width of the field.

Given:
- The length of the field (L) = 400 feet
- The width of the field (W) = 300 feet

We need to find the distance traveled by Jim and Martha and then compare the distances.

 Jim's distance is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{L^2 + W^2} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]

Martha's distance is the sum of the length and width of the field:
\[ \text{Martha's distance} = L + W = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate Jim's distance:
\[ \text{Jim's distance} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Martha's distance} - \text{Jim's distance} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Jim runs 200 feet less than Martha.

The final answer is: \boxed{200}

We are given that $\omega$ is a complex number such that $\omega^3 = 1.$ We need to find the possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.$

[ADVANCE]

Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2,$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}.$ These roots satisfy the equation $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0.$

We can use this property to simplify the given expression. Let's rewrite the expression:

\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.\]

Since $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0,$ we have $1 + \omega = -\omega^2$ and $1 + \omega^2 = -\omega.$ Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{-\omega^2} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega} = -\left(\frac{1}{\omega^2} + \frac{1}{\omega}\right).\]

We can combine the fractions:

\[-\left(\frac{1}{\omega^2} + \frac{1}{\omega}\right) = -\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{\omega^3}\right).\]

Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ we have:

\[-\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{1}\right) = -( \omega + \omega^2).\]

Using the fact that $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0,$ we can rewrite $\omega + \omega^2$ as $-1.$ Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[-(-1) = 1.\]

So, the value of the expression is $\boxed{1}.$

The problem asks for the minimum distance traveled when starting from any point $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once.

To solve this, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the shortest possible route that visits all points.

Let's assume the coordinates of the points are given as $A(0,0)$, $B(1,0)$, $C(1,1)$, and $D(0,1)$. These points form a square with side length 1.

We can calculate the distances between each pair of points:
- $AB = \sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = 1$
- $AC = \sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \sqrt{2}$
- $AD = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = 1$
- $BC = \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (1-0)^2} = 1$
- $BD = \sqrt{(0-1)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \sqrt{2}$
- $CD = \sqrt{(0-1)^2 + (1-1)^2} = 1$

Now, we need to find the shortest route that visits all four points. Since the points form a square, the shortest route will be the perimeter of the square, which is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.

The shortest route will be $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$ or any other permutation that visits each point exactly once and returns to the starting point. The total distance for this route is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.

However, if we consider the route that visits each point exactly once without returning to the starting point, the shortest distance will be the sum of the three smallest sides of the square, which is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.

Therefore, the minimum distance traveled when starting from any point $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once is $\boxed{3}$.
