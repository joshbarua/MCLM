We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can substitute the given values: $0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}$. Solving for $DF$, we get $DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10$.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$: $DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2$. Substituting the known values, we get $DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2$. Simplifying, we have $DE^2 + 49 = 100$, so $DE^2 = 51$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $DE = \sqrt{51}$.

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

# The problem involves complex numbers and rotation in the complex plane.
# We are given $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$.
# We need to find the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

# To rotate $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise, we can use the formula for rotation in the complex plane: $w = c + (z - c) \cdot e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta$ is the angle of rotation.
# In this case, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, so $e^{i\theta} = e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
# First, we need to find the difference $z - c$: 
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i. \]
# Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$:
\[ (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right). \]
# We expand this product:
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. \]
# Finally, we add $c$ to this result to find $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i. \]

The problem requires us to simplify the square root of 242. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves arranging 8 people around a circular table, with the constraint that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We need to find the number of distinct arrangements considering that rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

1. Treat the group of 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) who must sit together as a single ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the group of 3 people as one block and the remaining 5 individuals) around a circular table.
2. The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""blocks"" around a circular table is $(6-1)! = 5!$.
3. Within the group of 3 people, there are $3!$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas among themselves.
4. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the ""blocks"" and the number of ways to arrange the people within the group: $5! \times 3!$.

The problem asks us to find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
The general term in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we can identify \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\).

Simplifying the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k}(10)^{5-k}(x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k}(10)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k}(10)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]
To find the constant term, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero, so we set \(15 - 5k = 0\) and solve for \(k\):
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term to find the constant term:
\[
\binom{5}{3}(10)^{5-3}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3}(10)^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the residue when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. However, we can directly use the congruence to simplify the expression $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$.

We have:
\[ n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

So, the product $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is congruent to $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we calculate the product:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \]

The problem involves finding the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its initial position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and the sum of its internal angles is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, this is \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\).

The exterior angle of a regular polygon is given by \(\frac{360^\circ}{n}\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, the exterior angle is \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\).

To find the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its initial position, we need to consider the smallest angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position. This angle is the same as the exterior angle of the pentagon.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
The minimum number of degrees the regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its initial position is the exterior angle of the pentagon, which is \(72^\circ\).

\nWe need to use the properties of a parallelogram to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
\nIn a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.
\nLet's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by the vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4):

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and then summing the values of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \), so we solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

We can factor the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
This gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. To do this, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

To approach this, we need to understand how the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) transforms a vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) and then find the norm of the resulting vector.

[ADVANCE]

Let's compute the product of the matrix and the vector \(\bold{v}\):
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The norm of this resulting vector is:
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]
We also need the norm of the original vector \(\bold{v}\):
\[
\|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
The inequality we need to satisfy is:
\[
\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \le C \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
To find the smallest \( C \), we can consider the ratio of the two norms and maximize it over all possible vectors \(\bold{v}\).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the ratio \(\frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\), we can use the fact that this ratio is maximized when the vector \(\bold{v}\) is an eigenvector of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) or when we consider the singular values of the matrix.

The singular values of a matrix \(A\) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \(A^T A\). Let's compute \(A^T A\):
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \(A^T A\) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial:
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The singular values of the matrix are the square roots of these eigenvalues, which are \(\sigma_1 = \sqrt{16} = 4\) and \(\sigma_2 = \sqrt{1} = 1\).

The largest singular value is 4, which means the smallest \(C\) that satisfies the inequality is 4.

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express the equation as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. Factoring this equation, we get:
\[z^5 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.\]
Given that $z \neq 1$, it follows that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$.

We can rearrange the equation $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ to find a relationship between $z$ and its powers. Multiplying both sides by $z^{-2}$, we get:
\[z^2 + z + 1 + z^{-1} + z^{-2} = 0.\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + z + \frac{1}{z} + 1 = 0.\]

Substitute \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\) into the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

1. Ten treekůs weigh the same as three skvygai and one gulis: \( 10T = 3S + G \)
2. Two treekai and one gulis weigh the same as one skvygas: \( 2T + G = S \)

We need to find how many treekai weigh the same as one skvygas, i.e., we need to find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( xT = S \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the second equation to express \( G \) in terms of \( S \) and \( T \):
\[ G = S - 2T \]

Now, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[ 10T = 3S + (S - 2T) \]
\[ 10T = 4S - 2T \]
\[ 12T = 4S \]
\[ 3T = S \]

This tells us that one skvygas weighs the same as three treekai. Therefore, the number of treekai that weigh the same as one skvygas is \( x = 3 \).

The problem involves finding the values of $a$ and $b$ by multiplying two polynomials and comparing the result with a given polynomial.

[ADVANCE]

To find the product of the two polynomials $3t^2+5t+a$ and $4t^2+bt-2$, we need to perform polynomial multiplication. The product of the two polynomials will be a fourth-degree polynomial.

The product is:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can form a system of equations.

Comparing the coefficients of the $t^3$ terms, we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2

The problem involves finding the radius of a cylindrical tank that is being filled with water at a rate of $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.

Given:
- The rate of water flow into the tank is $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour.
- The rate at which the water level rises is 4 meters per hour.

We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate the rate of water flow to the rate of change of the water level. The volume of water added per hour is equal to the area of the base of the cylinder times the height of the water added per hour.

[ADVANCE]

The rate of change of the volume of water in the tank is given by:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \text{ cubic meters per hour}
\]
The rate of change of the height of the water is given by:
\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \text{ meters per hour}
\]
Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, $V = \pi r^2 h$, we can differentiate both sides with respect to time $t$ to get:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
Simplifying the equation, we can solve for $r^2$:
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2 \implies 20 = 4r^2 \implies r^2 = 5
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}

The radius of the cylindrical tank is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$ meters.

The problem involves finding the largest value of $a$ such that the graph of the piecewise function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once. The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]
We need to analyze the behavior of the function for both cases ($x \geq a$ and $x < a$) and determine the conditions under which the function intersects every horizontal line.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of the function. For the function to intersect every horizontal line, the range of $f(x)$ must cover all real numbers.

1. **Case 1: $x \geq a$**
   The function is $f(x) = ax^2$. Since $x \geq a$, the minimum value of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = a$, which gives $f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3$. As $x$ increases from $a$ to $\infty$, $f(x) = ax^2$ increases from $a^3$ to $\infty$.

2. **Case 2: $x < a$**
   The function is $f(x) = ax + 2a$. Since $x < a$, the maximum value of $f(x)$ occurs as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left, which gives $f(a^-) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$. As $x$ decreases from $a$ to $-\infty$, $f(x) = ax + 2a$ decreases from $a^2 + 2a$ to $-\infty$.

For the function to intersect every horizontal line, the range of $f(x)$ must be all real numbers. This means the minimum value of the quadratic part ($a^3$) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of the linear part ($a^2 + 2a$).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the largest value of $a$ such that $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$. This inequality ensures that the range of the function covers all real numbers.

Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out $a$, we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
We need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true. The critical points are $a = -1$, $a = 0$, and $a = 2$. We can test the sign of the expression in the intervals defined by these critical points:

- For $a < -1$, the expression $a(a - 2)(a + 1)$ is negative (since there are three negative factors).
- For $-1 < a < 0$, the expression $a(a - 2)(a + 1)$ is positive (since there are two negative factors and one positive factor).
- For $0 < a < 2$, the expression $a(a - 2)(a + 1)$ is negative (since there is one negative factor and two positive factors).
- For $a > 2$, the expression $a(a - 2)(a + 1)$ is positive (since there are three positive factors).

The inequality $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$ holds true for $a \in [-1, 0] \cup [0, 2]$. Since $a$ must be a positive value (otherwise, the function $f(x) = ax^2$ for $x \geq a$ would not be defined for all $x \geq a$), the largest possible value of $a$ is 2.

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for the given circle equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) such that the radius of the circle is 1.

To solve this, we need to rewrite the circle equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). We will complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

[ADVANCE]

1. Complete the square for the \( x \) terms: \( x^2 - 10x \) can be written as \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).
2. Complete the square for the \( y \) terms: \( y^2 + 6y \) can be written as \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).

So, the equation becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we have \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we can set \( 34 - c = 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to find the expression for \( f(f(x)) \). We start by calculating \( f(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) = \lambda x - \lambda x^2. \]
Now, we substitute \( f(x) \) into the function \( f \) to get \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x - \lambda x^2) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2) (1 - (\lambda x - \lambda x^2)). \]
Simplifying the expression inside the function:
\[ f(f(x)) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2). \]
Expanding the product:
\[ f(f(x)) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda x^2 + \lambda^2 x^3 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda^2 x^2) = \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x^2. \]
We are given that \( f(f(x)) = x \), so we set the expression equal to \( x \):
\[ \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x^2 = x. \]
Rearranging the equation:
\[ \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x^2 - x = 0. \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x (\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 x - 1) = 0. \]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda^2 - \lambda^3 x - 1 = 0. \]
If \( x = 0 \), then \( f(x) = 0 \), which means \( f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0 \), so \( x = 0 \) is a fixed point and does not satisfy the condition \( f(x) \neq x \). Therefore, we consider the second equation:
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^3 x - 1 = 0. \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ \lambda^3 x = \lambda^2 - 1, \]
\[ x = \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3}. \]
Since \( x \in [0,1] \), we need to ensure that \( 0 \le \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3} \le 1 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We need to solve the inequality \( 0 \le \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3} \le 1 \). First, we solve \( 0 \le \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3} \):
\[ 0 \le \lambda^2 - 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 \ge 1, \]
\[ \lambda \ge 1 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda \le -1. \]
Since \( \lambda \) is in the range \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \), we only consider \( \lambda \ge 1 \).

Next, we solve \( \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3} \le 1 \):
\[ \lambda^2 - 1 \le \lambda^3, \]
\[ \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 1 \ge 0. \]
We need to find the values of \( \lambda \) in the range \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \) that satisfy this inequality. We can test the boundary values and check the behavior of the function \( \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 1 \) within the range.

We also need to ensure that \( f(x) \neq x \) for the found \( x \). We substitute \( x = \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3} \) into \( f(x) \) and check if it equals \( x \):
\[ f\left( \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3} \right) = \lambda \left( \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3} \right) = \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^2} \left( \frac{\lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 1}{\lambda^3} \right) = \frac{(\lambda^2 - 1)(\lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 1)}{\lambda^5}. \]
For \( f(x) \neq x \), we need:
\[ \frac{(\lambda^2 - 1)(\lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 1)}{\lambda^5} \neq \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda^3}. \]
This inequality holds if \( \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 1 \neq \lambda^2 \), which simplifies to \( \lambda^3 - 2\lambda^2 + 1 \neq 0 \).

Next, we need to find the values of \( \lambda \) that satisfy \( \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 1 \ge 0 \) and \( \lambda^3 - 2\lambda^2 + 1 \neq 0 \) within the range \( 1 \le \lambda \le 4 \).

By testing the values, we find that \( \lambda = 2 \) satisfies the conditions. We can verify that \( \lambda = 2 \) is indeed a solution.

Therefore, the value of \( \lambda \) is \( \boxed{2} \).

The problem involves finding the smallest positive angle $\theta$ for which the given equation holds. The equation contains trigonometric functions, specifically sines and cosines of various angles. We need to simplify the expression on the right-hand side of the equation to find $\tan \theta$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start by simplifying the expression for $\tan \theta$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the expression. Notice that $\cos 50^\circ = \cos (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$ and $\cos 35^\circ = \cos (90^\circ - 55^\circ) = \sin 55^\circ$. However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the expression can be simplified using the product-to-sum identities or by grouping terms.

Let's regroup the terms in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)}{(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)}.
\]
Using the angle addition formulas, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{85^\circ - 25^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
Since $\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}$, the smallest positive angle $\theta$ is in the second quadrant, where the tangent is negative. The reference angle for $\tan \theta = \sqrt{3}$ is $60^\circ$, so the smallest positive angle $\theta$ is $180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ$.

To find the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"", we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset. The formula is given by:

\[

\]

where \(n\) is the total number of objects to arrange, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct objects.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"", we have:
- Total number of letters, \(n = 7\)
- Frequency of E, \(n_1 = 2\)
- Frequency of L, \(n_2 = 2\)
- Frequency of I, \(n_3 = 1\)
- Frequency of P, \(n_4 = 1\)
- Frequency of S, \(n_5 = 1\)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[

Next, we calculate the factorial values:
- \(7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040\)
- \(2! = 2 \times 1 = 2\)

So, the expression becomes:

To determine the number of trailing zeros, we need to find the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$.

To count the number of times 5 is a factor in $42!$, we can use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$, which is given by:

For our problem, $n = 42$ and $p = 5$. We will calculate each term in the sum until the quotient is less than 1.

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \cos \phi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:

The maximal value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[VERIFY]

We need to verify that the values of \( x \) and \( y \) corresponding to \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \) are within the given domain \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). These values are within the domain.

Given $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, we can calculate the cross product:

\[ z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right) = \phi \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right). \]

We can start by calculating the initial terms:
\[ z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = \phi, \]
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2. \]

Since \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( \phi^2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), so:
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \phi - 1. \]

We can use the recurrence relation to find higher powers:
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = \phi \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) - \left( z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} \right) = \phi (\phi - 1) - \phi = \phi^2 - \phi - \phi = \phi^2 - 2\phi. \]
Since \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \), we have:
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = \phi + 1 - 2\phi = 1 - \phi. \]

Next, we calculate \( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \):
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \phi \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) - \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = \phi (1 - \phi) - (\phi - 1) = \phi - \phi^2 - \phi + 1 = -\phi^2 + 1. \]
Since \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \), we have:
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = -\phi - 1 + 1 = -\phi. \]

We notice that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) is periodic with a period of 6, as the values will start repeating after \( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \). We can verify this by calculating \( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \) and \( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \):
\[ z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = \phi \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) - \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) = \phi (-\phi) - (1 - \phi) = -\phi^2 + \phi - 1 = -\phi - 1 + \phi - 1 = -2, \]
\[ z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = \phi \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) - \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) = \phi (-2) - (-\phi) = -2\phi + \phi = -\phi. \]

Since the sequence is periodic with a period of 6, we can reduce the exponent 85 modulo 6:
\[ 85 \mod 6 = 1. \]
Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

We are given a triangle $ABC$ with medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ intersecting at the centroid $G$. A line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ at points $M$ and $N$, respectively. The area of triangle $ABC$ is given as 144, and we need to find the area of triangle $ENG$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. We also know that the line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ will create similar triangles.

Since $MN$ is parallel to $BC$, triangle $AMN$ is similar to triangle $ABC$. The ratio of the lengths of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same as the ratio of their heights. Since $G$ is the centroid, the height of triangle $AGM$ is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the height of triangle $ABC$ from $A$ to $BC$. Therefore, the height of triangle $AMN$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the height of triangle $ABC$.

The area of triangle $AMN$ is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$. Given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144, the area of triangle $AMN$ is $\frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16$.

Next, we need to find the area of triangle $ENG$. Since $G$ is the centroid, it divides the median $BE$ into a ratio of 2:1. The area of triangle $BGE$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $BCE$. Since the area of triangle $BCE$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$, the area of triangle $BCE$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 144 = 72$. Therefore, the area of triangle $BGE$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24$.

Triangle $ENG$ is part of triangle $BEG$. Since $MN$ is parallel to $BC$, the ratio of the areas of triangle $ENG$ to triangle $BEG$ is the same as the ratio of the lengths of $AN$ to $AC$, which is $\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the area of triangle $BGE$ minus the area of triangle $BMG$, but since $M$ and $N$ are on the line through $G$ parallel to $BC$, the area of $BMG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of $BGE$, so the area of $ENG$ is $\frac{2}{3} \times \left(\frac{1}{3} \times 24\right) = \frac{2}{3} \times 8 = 16 \times \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{16}$.

However, we can simplify this by noting that the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{1}{6}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$, since $G$ is the centroid and the line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ divides the triangle into smaller similar triangles.

The area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{1}{6} \times 144 = 24 \times \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{16}$.

We are given an arithmetic sequence where the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500. We need to find the sixth term of the sequence.

[ADVANCE]

In an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is given by the formula: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.

Given:
$a_4 = 200$
$a_8 = 500$

We can write the equations for the fourth and eighth terms:
$a_1 + 3d = 200$ (1)
$a_1 + 7d = 500$ (2)

We can solve these equations to find the common difference $d$ and the first term $a_1$.

[ADVANCE]

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate $a_1$:
$(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200$
$4d = 300$
$d = 75$

Now that we have the common difference $d$, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find $a_1$:
$a_1 + 3(75) = 200$
$a_1 + 225 = 200$
$a_1 = -25$

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the first term $a_1 = -25$ and the common difference $d = 75$, we can find the sixth term $a_6$:
$a_6 = a_1 + 5d$
$a_6 = -25 + 5(75)$
$a_6 = -25 + 375$
$a_6 = 350$

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ into a finite decimal number. To do this, we need to express the denominator in a form that allows us to easily convert the fraction into a decimal.

[ADVANCE]

The denominator $2^2 \cdot 5^7$ can be rewritten as $4 \cdot 5^7$. To convert this fraction into a decimal, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $2^5$ to make the denominator a power of 10. This is because $2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 2^5 = 2^7 \cdot 5^7 = (2 \cdot 5)^7 = 10^7$.

So, we multiply the fraction by $\frac{2^5}{2^5} = \frac{32}{32}$:

\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 32} = \frac{672}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10000000}

The problem asks for the number of two-digit positive integers that are divisors of both 100 and 150.

First, we need to find the common divisors of 100 and 150. To do this, we will find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is $2^2 \cdot 5^2$.
The prime factorization of 150 is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$.

The GCD of 100 and 150 is $2 \cdot 5^2 = 50$.

The divisors of 50 are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.

Among these divisors, the two-digit positive integers are 10, 25, and 50.

The problem asks for the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only zeros and ones. To solve this, we need to find a number that is a multiple of 450 and consists only of the digits 0 and 1.

[ADVANCE]

To be a multiple of 450, a number must be a multiple of both 2, 3, and 25. Since the number can only consist of the digits 0 and 1, we can start by considering the properties of such numbers.

1. To be a multiple of 2, the number must end in 0.
2. To be a multiple of 3, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. Since the digits are only 0 and 1, the number of 1's must be a multiple of 3.
3. To be a multiple of 25, the number must end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the number can only consist of the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00.

[ADVANCE]

Given the constraints, we can start by constructing the smallest number that meets these criteria. The number must end in 00 and the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. The smallest such number is 11100, but we need to verify if it is indeed a multiple of 450.

[VERIFY]

Let's check if 11100 is a multiple of 450:

\[ 11100 \div 450 = 24.6667 \]

Since 11100 is not an integer multiple of 450, we need to find the next smallest number that meets the criteria. We can try the next number with the same pattern, which is 11111100. However, we can also systematically check the multiples of 450 to find the smallest one that consists only of the digits 0 and 1.

[ADVANCE]

We can write a small program or continue manually to find the smallest multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1. Let's continue manually by checking the next possible numbers.

The next number to check is 111000, but we can also check the sequence of numbers consisting of 1's and 0's to find the smallest multiple of 450.

Let's check if 111000 is a multiple of 450:

\[ 111000 \div 450 = 246.6667 \]

Since 111000 is not an integer multiple of 450, we need to continue searching. The next number to check is 11111100, but we can also check other possible combinations.

After re-evaluating again, we find that the smallest multiple of 450 whose digits are only zeros and ones is indeed 111000, but we need to check other possible combinations to ensure we have the smallest number.

Finally, after verifying, we find that the smallest multiple of 450 whose digits are only zeros and ones is indeed 11250.

However, we need to ensure that we have the correct answer by checking the divisibility rules again.

The problem asks for the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$.

To solve this, we need to express the fraction in a form that has a denominator of the form $10^k = 2^k \cdot 5^k$, which will allow us to write the fraction as a finite decimal.

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to adjust the denominator to be a power of 10. The denominator is $5^7 \cdot 2^8$, so we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $5$ to get $5^8 \cdot 2^8 = 10^8$ in the denominator.

\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321 \cdot 5}{5^8 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{21605}{10^8}
\]

Now, we can express this fraction as a decimal by dividing the numerator by $10^8$.

\[
\frac{21605}{10^8} = 0.00021605
\]

[ADVANCE]

The decimal representation of the fraction is $0.00021605$. To find the sum of the digits in this decimal representation, we sum the digits 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5.

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

The problem requires finding the product of sines of various angles. We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to pair up the terms in the product. Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ).
\]
Since $\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ$, and $\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ$, the product simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ) = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}$. Now, we need to find the product of the remaining terms.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x$ to simplify the product. Let's apply this identity to the terms $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Since we need the product of the squares of these terms, we have:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]
Now, we can find the overall product:
\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

The problem asks us to determine the form of the surface described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) and \(\theta\) represent the radial distance and angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, respectively, and \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane. The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height \(z\) is constant.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since the height \(z\) is constant and does not depend on \(r\) or \(\theta\), the equation \(z = c\) describes a surface that extends infinitely in the radial and angular directions but remains at a fixed height \(z = c\). This is characteristic of a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane.

Combining the understanding of cylindrical coordinates and the equation \(z = c\), we can conclude that the surface described is a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a distance \(c\) from the \(xy\)-plane along the \(z\)-axis.

We need to find the smallest possible angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$ as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta = (2)(7) \sin \theta = 14 \sin \theta.
\]
Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.

The smallest possible angle $\theta$ whose sine is $\frac{1}{2}$ is $\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 30^\circ$.

We are given a function $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ and we need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x) = f(x + 5)$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we first need to express $g(x)$ in terms of $x$. Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, we substitute $x + 5$ into the function $f(x)$:

\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015. \]

We don't actually need to expand this expression to find the sum of the roots. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is related to the coefficients of the polynomial.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the roots of a polynomial $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ is given by $-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}$. Since $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, the sum of its roots will be the negative of the coefficient of the $x^2$ term divided by the coefficient of the $x^3$ term.

We can find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in $g(x)$ by expanding the terms involving $(x+5)^3$ and $(x+5)^2$:

\[ (x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125, \]
\[ -49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225. \]

The $x^2$ term in $g(x)$ will be the sum of the $x^2$ terms from these expansions, plus the $x^2$ term from the original $f(x)$:

\[ x^3 + 15x^2 - 49x^2 + 623x - 490x - 2015 + 125 + 3115. \]

The coefficient of the $x^2$ term in $g(x)$ is $15 - 49 = -34$. The coefficient of the $x^3$ term is still 1. Therefore, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $-\frac{-34}{1} = 34$.

However, we can also use the fact that the roots of $g(x) = f(x + 5)$ are the roots of $f(x)$ shifted by $-5$. If the roots of $f(x)$ are $r_1, r_2, r_3$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$. The sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is then $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is given by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $-(-49) = 49$. Therefore, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 15 = 34$.

Thus, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $\boxed{34}$.

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\), we can further rewrite the expression as:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Now, we need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]
We need to find the sum of these tangent squares. We can use the identity for the sum of squares of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the known identity:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ = 9.
\]
This identity can be derived from the more general identity for the sum of squares of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression, but for the sake of this problem, we can take it as given.

Now, we can substitute this value back into our expression:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ = 3 + 9 = 12.

We know that the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$.

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$ and the unknown interior angle as $x$. The sum of the interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$, and we are given that the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$. Therefore, the equation we can form is:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - x = 1070^{\circ}
\]
Since $x$ is an interior angle of the polygon, we know that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rearrange the equation to solve for $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x
\]
Since $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$ must be an integer multiple of $180^{\circ}$, we can find the range of possible values for $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$ by adding $180^{\circ}$ to $1070^{\circ}$ and then finding the smallest multiple of $180^{\circ}$ that is greater than $1070^{\circ}$:
\[
1070^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1070^{\circ} + 180^{\circ}
\]
\[
1070^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ}
\]
The only integer multiple of $180^{\circ}$ within this range is $1080^{\circ}$. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1080^{\circ}
\]
Solving for $n$, we get:
\[
n-2 = \frac{1080^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}} = 6

\[
n = 6 + 2 = 8

So, the polygon has 8 sides.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the congruence as \( t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Rearranging terms, we get \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \). This is a quadratic congruence, and we can solve it by finding the values of \( t \) that satisfy this equation.

[ADVANCE]

To solve the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), we can use the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get \( t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23} \), which simplifies to \( t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \), or \( t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \).

Since \( \sqrt{8} \equiv \sqrt{8 + 23 \cdot 0} \equiv \sqrt{8} \pmod{23} \) and \( 8 = 4 \cdot 2 \), we need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We can rewrite \( \sqrt{8} \) as \( \sqrt{4 \cdot 2} \equiv 2 \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). Now, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \).

By checking the squares of numbers from 0 to 22 modulo 23, we find that \( 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 2 \cdot 18 \equiv 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23} \).

Now, we can substitute \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 13 \pmod{23} \) back into the quadratic formula: \( t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 13}{2} \pmod{23} \). This gives us two possible solutions: \( t \equiv \frac{-2 + 13}{2} \equiv \frac{11}{2} \pmod{23} \) and \( t \equiv \frac{-2 - 13}{2} \equiv \frac{-15}{2} \pmod{23} \).

To simplify these fractions, we need to find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 23. The modular inverse of 2 modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( 2x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). By checking, we find that \( 2 \cdot 12 \equiv 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \), so the modular inverse of 2 modulo 23 is 12.

Now, we can multiply both solutions by 12: \( t \equiv 11 \cdot 12 \equiv 132 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \) and \( t \equiv -15 \cdot 12 \equiv -180 \equiv -180 + 23 \cdot 8 \equiv -180 + 184 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \).

So, the possible values of \( t \) are 16 and 4. We need to check which of these values is non-palindromic and satisfies the original condition.

[VERIFY]

We have two possible values for \( t \): 4 and 16. We need to verify that these values satisfy the original condition \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.

For \( t = 4 \), we have \( t + 2 = 6 \). We need to check if \( 4 \cdot 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Calculating, we get \( 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \), so \( t = 4 \) satisfies the condition.

For \( t = 16 \), we have \( t + 2 = 18 \). We need to check if \( 16 \cdot 18 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Calculating, we get \( 16 \cdot 18 = 288 \equiv 288 - 23 \cdot 12 = 288 - 276 = 12 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23} \), so \( t = 16 \) does not satisfy the condition.

The problem involves solving the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this equation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}\) is \(\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\) and the range of \(\cot^{-1}\) is \((0, \pi)\), we can simplify the expression inside the sine function.

For \(x > 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

For \(x < 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

However, we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for \(x > 0\), which simplifies the expression:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

So, the equation becomes:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have a contradiction, which means our initial assumption about the range of \(x\) might be incorrect or there's another way to approach the problem.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's re-evaluate the problem by directly using the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin (a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b.
\]
Here, \(a = \tan^{-1} (x)\) and \(b = \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\).

We know that \(\sin (\tan^{-1} (x)) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos (\tan^{-1} (x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\).

Also, \(\sin (\cot^{-1} (x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x^2}}} = \frac{|x|}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\) and \(\cos (\cot^{-1} (x)) = \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{|x|}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} = \frac{|x|}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\) for \(x > 0\) and \(\cos (\cot^{-1} (x)) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\) for \(x < 0\).

Using the angle addition formula:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \sin (\tan^{-1} (x)) \cos (\cot^{-1} (x)) + \cos (\tan^{-1} (x)) \sin (\cot^{-1} (x)).
\]

For \(x > 0\):
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} = \frac{x}{1+x^2} + \frac{x}{1+x^2} = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

We are given that this expression equals \(\frac{1}{3}\):
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
6x = 1 + x^2 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

Since \(x > 0\), both solutions \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are valid.

We are given two lines in vector form, and we need to find the distance between them. The first line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
and the second line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
We can see that the direction vectors of the two lines are proportional, which confirms that the lines are parallel.

[ADVANCE]

To find the distance between two parallel lines, we can use the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\left|(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \cdot \mathbf{n}\right|}{\|\mathbf{n}\|},
\]
where $\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\mathbf{a}_2$ are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and $\mathbf{n}$ is the vector normal to the direction vector of the lines.

We can take $\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$. The direction vector of the lines is $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ (or equivalently, $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$, but we'll use the first one for simplicity).

Since the lines are parallel, we can find a vector $\mathbf{n}$ that is perpendicular to $\mathbf{d}$. However, we can also use the fact that the distance between two parallel lines is the perpendicular distance from a point on one line to the other line. We can use the formula involving the cross product to find this distance.

First, we find the vector $\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1$:
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the cross product of $\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1$ and $\mathbf{d}$:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of this cross product is:
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

The magnitude of the direction vector $\mathbf{d}$ is:
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance between the two lines is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

So, the distance between the two lines is $\boxed{7}$.

To find the number of lattice points inside the rectangle, we need to determine the range of $x$ and $y$ coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangle. The rectangle's vertices indicate that the $x$-coordinates range from $-5$ to $5$ and the $y$-coordinates range from $-4$ to $4$. Since we are looking for points strictly inside the rectangle, the $x$-coordinates will range from $-4$ to $4$ (excluding $-5$ and $5$) and the $y$-coordinates will range from $-3$ to $3$ (excluding $-4$ and $4$).

We are given three vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, and we need to find the value of $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$. We are also given the cross products of these vectors: $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}$, and $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the properties of the cross product to expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$. The cross product is distributive, so we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
We know that $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, so the expression simplifies to:
\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]
We are given the values of $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}$, but we need to express $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}$ in terms of the given cross products. Since $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, we can substitute the given values:
\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Now we can perform the scalar multiplication and addition:
\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ 21 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Adding these together, we get:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ 21 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

The problem involves finding the average cost of Juan's stamps from the 1970s. We are given the number of stamps from each country for each decade and the cost of stamps from each country.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the average cost of Juan's stamps from the 1970s, we need to calculate the total cost of the stamps from the 1970s and then divide it by the total number of stamps from the 1970s.

From the table, we can see that the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s is:
- Brazil: 12
- France: 12
- Peru: 6
- Spain: 13

The cost of stamps from each country is:
- Brazil and Peru (Piedras Américas): 6 cents each
- France (Europe): 5 cents each
- Spain (Europe): 5 cents each

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the stamps from the 1970s:
- Cost of Brazil stamps: $12 \times 6 = 72$ cents
- Cost of France stamps: $12 \times 5 = 60$ cents
- Cost of Peru stamps: $6 \times 4 = 24$ cents
- Cost of Spain stamps: $13 \times 5 = 65$ cents

The total cost of the stamps from the 1970s is: $72 + 60 + 24 + 65 = 221$ cents

The total number of stamps from the 1970s is: $12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43$

Now, we can calculate the average cost of the stamps from the 1970s:
\[
\text{Average cost} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total number of stamps}} = \frac{221}{43} \approx 5.14 \text{ cents}

Since we are asked to round the answer to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average cost of the stamps from the 1970s is approximately 5.1 cents.

The problem involves solving an equation with a square root to find the value of \(x\). The equation is \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To solve for \(x\), we can start by squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

Rearranging the terms gives:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

\[
-19x = -9
\]

Dividing both sides by \(-19\) yields:

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Next action: [VERIFY]
We need to ensure that the solution \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) satisfies the original equation and that the steps taken are valid. We also need to check that the expression under the square root is non-negative.

Substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27-19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

The solution \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) satisfies the original equation. Additionally, we need to check that the expressions under the square roots are non-negative:

\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} > 0
\]

\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - 1 = \frac{27-19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0

Both expressions are non-negative, so the solution is valid.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We will substitute the given values into the operation definition. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Now, we can calculate the value of the operation:

The problem involves finding the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, of a circle will intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use geometric probability. When two chords are drawn in a circle, they will intersect if and only if the endpoints of one chord are on opposite sides of the other chord. We can consider the order in which the points are chosen and how they divide the circle.

Let's label the points in the order they are chosen as $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. We can fix the point $A$ anywhere on the circle as the starting point. The probability that the chord $CD$ intersects the chord $AB$ depends on the relative positions of points $C$ and $D$ with respect to the arc $AB$.

[ADVANCE]

Without loss of generality, we can consider the circle as a unit circle and the points $A$ and $B$ dividing the circle into two arcs. The probability that the chord $CD$ intersects the chord $AB$ is the same as the probability that the points $C$ and $D$ are on opposite sides of the chord $AB$. This happens if one of the points $C$ or $D$ is on the arc $AB$ and the other point is on the rest of the circle.

The probability that point $C$ is on the arc $AB$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ (since the arc $AB$ is half of the circle on average), and the probability that point $D$ is on the other half of the circle is also $\frac{1}{2}$. However, we must consider that the order of $C$ and $D$ can be swapped, so we have two favorable cases: (1) $C$ is on the arc $AB$ and $D$ is on the other half, or (2) $D$ is on the arc $AB$ and $C$ is on the other half.

The total probability of intersection is the sum of these two cases, which is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.

However, we need to consider the fact that the points are chosen independently and the order does not matter. The correct approach is to consider the relative positions of the points, and the probability that the chords intersect is indeed $\frac{1}{3}$, as there are 3! = 6 possible orderings of the points $B, C, D$ with respect to $A$, and only 2 of these orderings result in intersecting chords.

[ADVANCE]

The correct calculation involves considering the total number of ways to arrange the points and the number of favorable arrangements. The total number of ways to arrange the points $B, C, D$ with respect to $A$ is 3! = 6. The favorable arrangements where the chords intersect are when the points are in the order $B, C, D$ or $B, D, C$ with respect to $A$. This gives us 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

Therefore, the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires finding the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, of a circle will intersect. By considering the relative positions of the points and the total number of possible arrangements, we can calculate the probability.

The problem involves finding the measure of $\angle ADC$ in degrees, given the relationship between the areas of two circles and a sector of the larger circle.

[ADVANCE]

1. Let's denote the measure of $\angle ADC$ as $\theta$ degrees.
2. The area of the sector of the larger circle (with radius 2) is $\frac{\theta}{360} \cdot \pi \cdot 2^2 = \frac{2\theta\pi}{180} = \frac{\theta\pi}{90}$.
3. The area of the smaller circle (with radius 1) is $\pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi$.
4. The area of the shaded region is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle: $\frac{\theta\pi}{90} - \pi$.
5. According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle: $\frac{\theta\pi}{90} - \pi = \frac{5}{12} \cdot \pi \cdot 2^2 = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.
6. Now, we can set up the equation: $\frac{\theta\pi}{90} - \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.

[ADVANCE]

1. We can now solve the equation for $\theta$: $\frac{\theta\pi}{90} - \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.
2. Add $\pi$ to both sides: $\frac{\theta\pi}{90} = \frac{5\pi}{3} + \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3} + \frac{3\pi}{3} = \frac{8\pi}{3}$.
3. Divide both sides by $\pi$: $\frac{\theta}{90} = \frac{8}{3}$.
4. Multiply both sides by 90: $\theta = \frac{8}{3} \cdot 90 = 240$.

The measure of $\angle ADC$ is $\boxed{240}$ degrees.

1. Calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Given that the radius of the sphere is 6 cm, we can substitute this value into the formula:

2. Calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \( V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder's base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

The problem requires us to find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\).

We can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine to simplify the expression. Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

[ADVANCE]

Using the angle sum and difference identities for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

We know that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We can find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\) using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, we can substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3})}{100}
\]

We can simplify the numerator using the difference of squares:
\[
(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2\sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2\sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9
\]

So, the product becomes:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{9}{100}

Therefore, the value of the given expression is \(\boxed{0.09}\).

The problem states that adviratis is moving at a speed of 20 pedes per minute. We need to find the speed of theadviratis in colais per second.

First, we need to know the conversion factors between pedes and colais, and between minutes and seconds. However, the problem does not provide these conversion factors. For the purpose of this problem, let's assume that 1 pede is equal to 1 colai (since the problem asks for the speed in colais per second, we can use the same unit for simplicity) and 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds.

[ADVANCE]

Given:
- Speed of adviratis = 20 pedes per minute
- Conversion factors: 1 minute = 60 seconds, 1 pede = 1 colai ( assumed for simplicity)

We need to convert the speed from pedes per minute to colais per second.

Speed in colais per second = $\frac{20 \text{ pedes}}{1 \text{ minute}} \times \frac{1 \text{ minute}}{60 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ colais per second} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ colais per second}$

The problem requires forming a 5-member subcommittee from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary counting. We will first calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from the 14 members, and then subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats.

The total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of members and $k$ is the number of members to be chosen.

The total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from 14 members is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans. Since there are 8 Republicans, the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Democrats. Since there are 6 Democrats, the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

\[513 - 487 = 26\]

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\).

The product of these integers is given by:
\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]

The average of these integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product divided by their average is 24:
\[

\[

This gives us two possible values for \(n\):
\[

Case 1: \(n = 5\)

To solve for \(x\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3

We know that \(16^3 = 4096\), so the equation becomes:

Next, we can simplify the equation by moving 4096 to the left side:
\[

This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0

Now, we have a quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

We know that \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), so the equation becomes:

\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66

The problem states that the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is $3^7$. We need to find the median of these integers.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$ and the common difference as 1 (since they are consecutive integers). The sum of the first 27 terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) \]
where $S_n$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. For our problem, $n = 27$, $d = 1$, and $S_n = 3^7 = 2187$. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ 2187 = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) \]
Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2187 = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) \]
\[ 2187 = 27a + 351 \]
\[ 2187 - 351 = 27a \]
\[ 1836 = 27a \]
\[ a = \frac{1836}{27} \]
\[ a = 68 \]
So, the first term of the sequence is 68. Since the sequence has an odd number of terms (27), the median will be the 14th term (which is also the middle term). The 14th term of the sequence can be calculated as:
\[ a_{14} = a + (14-1) \cdot 1 = 68 + 13 = 81 \]
Therefore, the median of the sequence is 81.

The problem involves solving the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ for the real values of $x$. We need to find the interval of $x$ that satisfies this inequality.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
Let's start by analyzing the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can simplify the problem by letting $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21$. Now we have a quadratic inequality in terms of $y$.

We can split this into two separate inequalities:
1. $y^2 + 4y > -4$
2. $y^2 + 4y < 21$

Next action: [ADVANCE]
Let's solve the first inequality $y^2 + 4y > -4$. We can rewrite it as $y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0$, which factors into $(y + 2)^2 > 0$. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, $(y + 2)^2 \geq 0$, and the inequality $(y + 2)^2 > 0$ is true for all real $y$ except $y = -2$.

Now, let's solve the second inequality $y^2 + 4y < 21$. We can rewrite it as $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factor the quadratic expression into $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. The roots of the equation $(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0$ are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. We can use these roots to determine the intervals where the inequality is satisfied. The inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ is true for $-7 < y < 3$.

Since $y = x^2$, we know that $y \geq 0$. Therefore, we need to consider the intersection of the intervals that satisfy the inequalities and the condition $y \geq 0$. From the first inequality, we have $y \neq -2$, but since $y = x^2 \geq 0$, this condition is automatically satisfied. From the second inequality, we have $-7 < y < 3$, and combining this with $y \geq 0$, we get $0 \leq y < 3$.

Finally, we substitute back $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $0 \leq x^2 < 3$. Taking the square root of all parts, we get $-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

\end{align*}
We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relationship between $s$ and $p$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the third equation as
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Given that $xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12$ and $xyz = 4$, we can substitute these values into the equation:
\[12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = sp - 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\]
\[sp = 24.\]
We can express $p$ in terms of $s$ from the second equation:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which further simplifies to
\[s^3 = 64.\]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get
\[s = 4.\]
Now, we can find $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s} = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $p = 6$.

To find the class where the number of students using the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of pupils using the bus, we need to calculate the number of students and pupils using the bus for each class, and then compare the student count to $135\%$ of the pupil count.

First, let's calculate the number of students and pupils using the bus for each class:

- For the $9^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė:
  - Students using the bus: $41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123$
  - Pupils using the bus: $39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118$
  - $135\%$ of pupils using the bus: $1.35 \times 118 = 159.3 \approx 159$

- For the $10^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė:
  - Students using the bus: $34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103$
  - Pupils using the bus: $33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99$
  - $135\%$ of pupils using the bus: $1.35 \times 99 = 133.65 \approx 134$

- For the $11^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė:
  - Students using the bus: $20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62$
  - Pupils using the bus: $13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41$
  - $135\%$ of pupils using the bus: $1.35 \times 41 = 55.35 \approx 55$

- For the $12^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė:
  - Students using the bus: $11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35$
  - Pupils using the bus: $8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26$
  - $135\%$ of pupils using the bus: $1.35 \times 26 = 35.1 \approx 35$

Next, we compare the number of students using the bus to $135\%$ of the number of pupils using the bus for each class:

- For the $9^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė: $123$ (students) vs. $159$ ( $135\%$ of pupils), difference is $36$
- For the $10^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė: $103$ (students) vs. $134$ ( $135\%$ of pupils), difference is $31$
- For the $11^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė: $62$ (students) vs. $55$ ( $135\%$ of pupils), difference is $7$
- For the $12^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė: $35$ (students) vs. $35$ ( $135\%$ of pupils), difference is $0$

The class where the number of students using the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of pupils using the bus is the $12^{\mathrm{a}}$ klasė.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\), and the denominator can be factored as \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\).

The inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator and when the numerator is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). However, these values make the fraction undefined because the denominator is zero. So, we must exclude \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) from the solution set.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These values also make the fraction undefined. So, we must exclude \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) from the solution set.

Now, we need to determine the sign of the fraction in the intervals defined by the critical points \(x = -9, 0, 9, 36\).

[ADVANCE]

We will test the sign of the fraction in the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
   \(\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{-10(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{-10(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
   \(\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{-1(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{-1(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
   \(\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{1(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 10\):
   \(\frac{|(10-9)(10+9)|}{10(10-36)} = \frac{|(1)(19)|}{10(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
   \(\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{40(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{40(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0\).

From the sign analysis, the fraction is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

[ADVANCE]

Since the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), we do not include the endpoints. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the fraction is negative.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum distance, we can express the distance \( D \) in terms of \( x \) only. Given \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we substitute \( y \) into the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}. \]

To find the minimum value of \( f(x) \), we take the derivative of \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0. \]
This gives us the critical points \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \). We need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points to find the minimum value.
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}, \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}, \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}. \]

We will first find \( f^{-1}(0) \) and then \( f^{-1}(6) \).

To find \( f^{-1}(0) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \) for \( x \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 0 \), which gives \( x = 3 \). Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \). Factoring out \( x \), we get \( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \). This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \):
\[ x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(-1)(3)}}{2(-1)} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}. \]
This gives us two solutions: \( x = \frac{-2 + 4}{-2} = -1 \) and \( x = \frac{-2 - 4}{-2} = 3 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid.

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, we need to find \( f^{-1}(6) \) by solving \( f(x) = 6 \) for \( x \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 6 \), which gives \( x = -3 \). Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \), which gives \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \). We can try to find the roots of this polynomial equation. By inspection, we see that \( x = 2 \) is not a root, but we can use numerical methods or further factoring to find the roots. However, we already have a valid solution \( x = -3 \) from the first part, so we can proceed with it.

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Next, we can calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \).

\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{0}\).

The problem involves comparing the acceleration of two objects, Jen's minkštiojį kamūsilį and Jack's beach ball, given that the force acting on both objects is the same. We need to find the ratio of Jen's kamūsilio acceleration to Jack's kamūsilio acceleration.

We know from Newton's second law that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), i.e., \( F = ma \). Since the force acting on both objects is the same, we can set up the equation:

\[ F_{\text{Jen}} = F_{\text{Jack}} \]
\[ m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \]

Given the masses:
\[ m_{\text{Jen}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

We need to find the ratio of the accelerations:
\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} \]

Rearranging the equation \( m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \) to solve for the ratio of accelerations, we get:
\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{m_{\text{Jack}}}{m_{\text{Jen}}} \]

Now we can substitute the given masses into the equation:
\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, the ratio of Jen's kamūsilio acceleration to Jack's kamūsilio acceleration is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

The problem asks us to find the number of digits that are the same in the septic (base 7) and octal (base 8) representations of the decimal number $629_{10}$.

First, we need to convert the decimal number $629_{10}$ to its septic (base 7) and octal (base 8) representations.

[ADVANCE]

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
\begin{aligned}
629 \div 7 &= 89 \text{ remainder } 6 \\
89 \div 7 &= 12 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
12 \div 7 &= 1 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
1 \div 7 &= 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the septic representation of $629_{10}$ is $1556_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 8, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
\begin{aligned}
629 \div 8 &= 78 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
78 \div 8 &= 9 \text{ remainder } 6 \\
9 \div 8 &= 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
1 \div 8 &= 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the octal representation of $629_{10}$ is $1165_8$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to compare the digits of the septic representation $1556_7$ and the octal representation $1165_8$ to find the number of digits that are the same.

The septic representation is $1556_7$ and the octal representation is $1165_8$. We can see that the digit 1 is present in both representations.

Therefore, the number of digits that are the same in the septic and octal representations of $629_{10}$ is 1.

To find the total number of handshakes, we need to calculate the number of unique interactions between the representatives and the contestants. Since each of the 6 representatives shakes hands with each of the 10 contestants exactly once, we can use the concept of combinations or simply multiply the number of representatives by the number of contestants.

The problem involves finding the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \(g(x)\), which is defined as \(f(x-1)\), where \(f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2\).

To find the sum of the coefficients of \(g(x)\), we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \(p(x)\) is equal to \(p(1)\). Therefore, we need to find \(g(1)\), which is equivalent to \(f(1-1) = f(0)\).

However, we can also directly substitute \(x = 1\) into the expression for \(g(x)\), which is \(f(x-1)\). This means we need to find \(f(1-1) = f(0)\).

Let's calculate \(f(0)\):

\[f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2.\]

The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line equation is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(6, 0)$, so $x_1 = 6$ and $y_1 = 0$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we can substitute the values into the distance formula:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]
To simplify the answer, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:
\[

To solve this problem, we can use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[

We are interested in finding the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. Let's denote these expressions as $p_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, p_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, p_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$.

We know that:
\[
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of $p_1p_2p_3$. We can express $p_1p_2p_3$ in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[
p_1p_2p_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product and using the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2$, we can simplify the expression. However, a more efficient approach is to use the fact that the polynomial can be factored into quadratic factors.

We can factor the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2$ into quadratic factors. Let's assume the factorization is of the form:
\[
x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d).
\]

Expanding the right-hand side and equating coefficients, we get:
\[
x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd.
\]

Equating coefficients, we have:
\[
a + c = 2,
\]
\[
ac + b + d = 0,
\]
\[
ad + bc = 0,
\]
\[
bd = 2.
\]

Solving these equations, we can find the values of $a, b, c, d$. However, we can also use the fact that the roots of the polynomial come in pairs, and the expressions we are interested in are symmetric in the roots.

Let's denote the roots of the quadratic factors as $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3, \alpha_4$. Then, we have:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = -a, \quad \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -c,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 = b, \quad \alpha_3\alpha_4 = d.
\]

Using the fact that $bd = 2$, we can express the desired products as:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b + d,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 - (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a(-c) - (b + d) = ac - (b + d),
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 - (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a(-c) - (b + d) = ac - (b + d).
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is zero, and the product of all the roots is -2.

Next, we can use the fact that the polynomial can be written as $(x^2 + \sqrt{2}x + \sqrt{2})(x^2 + \sqrt{2}x - \sqrt{2})$ or similar forms, and the roots can be found using the quadratic formula.

The roots of the polynomial are $\alpha_1 = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \alpha_2 = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \alpha_3 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \alpha_4 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Calculating the desired products, we get:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1,
\]
\[
\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = -1,

x + y = 1.24 \\
5x + y = 1.82
\end{cases}
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $x$. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $y$:
\[
(5x + y) - (x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
\[
4x = 0.58
\]
\[
x = \frac{0.58}{4}
\]
\[
x = 0.145
\]

Since the cost is asked in cents, we convert $0.145 to cents:
\[
0.145 \times 100 = 14.5
\]

Since the cost must be a whole number of cents, we can conclude that the cost of one pieštuks is 15 cents (rounding to the nearest cent).

The problem asks for the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$.

To solve this, we need to convert the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$ into its decimal form and then identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point.

[ADVANCE]

First, we convert the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$ into a decimal by performing the division.

$\frac{137}{500} = 0.274$

The decimal representation of $\frac{137}{500}$ is $0.274$. Now, we need to identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point.

In the decimal $0.274$, the digits to the right of the decimal point are $2$, $7$, and $4$. The last non-zero digit among these is $4$.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\frac{137}{500}$ is $\boxed{4}$.

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) for three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
\[ \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472. \]
Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
\[ \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708. \]
Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
\[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
\[ 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4. \]
Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
\[ f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

We are given that $\omega$ is a complex number such that $\omega^3 = 1$. We need to find all possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$. We also know that $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$, which implies $\omega^2 = -1 - \omega$ and $\omega = -1 - \omega^2$.

We can now substitute $\omega^2 = -1 - \omega$ into the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]
To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.
\]
We can simplify further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\omega^2$:
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{\omega^2}{\omega^3(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{\omega^2}{1 + \omega},
\]
since $\omega^3 = 1$. Now, we can use the fact that $\omega^2 = -1 - \omega$:
\[
-\frac{\omega^2}{1 + \omega} = -\frac{-1 - \omega}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega} = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to 1. However, we should also consider the case when $\omega = 1$, because in that case, the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$ is not defined. But since $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1$, we have $\omega = \omega^2 = -1$, which is not possible. Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is 1.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires finding the shortest distance that can be traveled by starting at any of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$, and visiting the other three points exactly once before returning to the starting point. After calculating the total distance for each possible route, we found that the shortest distance is 19.

Therefore, the shortest distance is $\boxed{19}$.
