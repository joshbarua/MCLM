The problem involves finding the length of $DE$ in a right triangle $DEF$ where $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7.

We know that $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}$, and we are given that $\sin D = 0.7$ and $EF = 7$. We can use this information to find the length of $DE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can set up the equation using the definition of sine: $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7$. Given that $EF = 7$, we can substitute this value into the equation: $\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7$. To find $DE$, we can solve for $DE$ by dividing 7 by 0.7.

$DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10$

We are given a complex number $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and another complex number $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$ which is the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.

To solve this, we can use the formula for rotating a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$: $w = c + (z - c) \cdot e^{i\theta}$. Here, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to find the difference between $z$ and $c$: $z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i$.

Next, we need to multiply this difference by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$. Since $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, we have:
\[
(z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = (\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) + (-3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i.
\]

Now, we add this result to $c$ to find $w$: $w = c + (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i$.

The problem requires us to simplify $\sqrt{242}$. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root expression:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves arranging 8 people around a round table, with the constraint that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We need to determine the number of distinct seating arrangements under this condition.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Treat the group of 3 people as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can treat them as a single unit or ""block."" This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the 5 individual people plus the block of 3) around a round table.
2. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange 6 units around a round table**: The number of distinct arrangements of $n$ objects around a round table is $(n-1)!$. So, for 6 units, the number of arrangements is $(6-1)! = 5! = 120$.
3. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange the 3 people within the block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in $3! = 6$ different ways.
4. **Calculate the total number of distinct seating arrangements**: The total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units around the table and the number of ways to arrange the 3 people within the block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is $120 \times 6 = 720$.

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}x^{3(5-k)}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{-2k}
\]
Simplifying the exponents of \(x\), we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{3}10^{5-3}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3x^{15-5\cdot3} = \binom{5}{3}10^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3x^0
\]
Calculating the value, we have:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]
So, the constant term is:
\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

Substituting $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we get:
\[ n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

So, we need to find the product:
\[ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 24 \pmod{7} \]

Now, we simplify $24 \pmod{7}$:

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram given the coordinates of the other three vertices. The coordinates of the vertices are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y) with the condition that $x > 7$. We need to use the properties of a parallelogram to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

[ADVANCE]

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
Now, let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and (x, y):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for x:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 6$ is not a valid solution. We need to reconsider the pairs of vertices to find the correct fourth vertex.

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
Now, let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (7, 4) and (x, y):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for x:
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 4$ is not a valid solution. We need to consider the last pair of vertices.

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (x, y):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)

Now, let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and (7, 4):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]
Solving the first equation for x:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
Solving the second equation for y:
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are (8, 9). We need to find the value of $x + y$:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

We know that \(\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\) and \(\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\). Given \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can rewrite this as \(\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\). This simplifies to \(\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}\).

We also know that \(\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\). Using the relationship \(\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}\), we can substitute to find \(\tan A\).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting \(\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}\) into the expression for \(\tan A\), we get \(\tan A = \frac{2 \cdot \text{adjacent}}{\text{adjacent}} = 2\).

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \) and then calculating the sum of the asymptote values.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting the factored form equal to zero gives us the vertical asymptotes:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2. \]
So, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), which means \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), where \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the sum \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

The problem asks us to calculate $99^2 + 99 + 1$ mentally. We need to find a way to simplify this calculation to make it easier to compute in our heads.

Next, we add $99$ to the result:
\[99^2 + 99 = 9801 + 99 = 9900.\]

Finally, we add $1$ to get the final result:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901.\]

To approach this problem, we need to understand the properties of matrix norms and how they relate to the transformation of vectors.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) as \( A \). We need to find the smallest \( C \) such that \(\| A \bold{v} \| \le C \| \bold{v} \| \) for all vectors \(\bold{v} \).

The matrix norm induced by the vector norm is given by \(\| A \| = \max_{\bold{v} \neq \bold{0}} \frac{\| A \bold{v} \|}{\| \bold{v} \|} \). Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of \(\frac{\| A \bold{v} \|}{\| \bold{v} \|} \) over all non-zero vectors \(\bold{v} \).

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \). Then, \( A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \).

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is \(\| A \bold{v} \| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \).

The norm of \(\bold{v} \) is \(\| \bold{v} \| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).

We need to find the maximum value of \(\frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \).

To simplify, let's consider the ratio \(\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2} \) and find its maximum value.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of \(\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2} \), we can use the fact that this expression is maximized when the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \) is an eigenvector of the matrix \( A^T A \), where \( A^T \) is the transpose of \( A \).

The transpose of \( A \) is \( A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The matrix \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \]

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the solutions to the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0 \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

The characteristic equation is:
\[ \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \), we get:
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2} \]

So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = 16 \) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = 1 \).

The maximum value of \(\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2} \) is the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is 16.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(\frac{\| A \bold{v} \|}{\| \bold{v} \|} \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Thus, the smallest positive real number \( C \) is \( \boxed{4} \).

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express this equation as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. Factoring the left-hand side, we get $(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0$. Given that $z \neq 1$, it follows that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$.

The number $58_9$ in base 10 is calculated as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

The number $18_9$ in base 10 is calculated as:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}.\]

Now, we perform the subtraction in base 10:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

Next, we need to convert the result, $36_{10}$, back to base 9.

To convert $36_{10}$ to base 9, we divide the number by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]

Since the quotient is 4 and the remainder is 0, we can express $36_{10}$ in base 9 as:

2. The weight of 2 Treeks and 1 Goolee is equal to the weight of 1 Squig: $2T + G = S$.

We need to find the number of Treeks whose combined weight is equal to the weight of one Squig, i.e., we need to find $x$ such that $xT = S$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the second equation to express $G$ in terms of $T$ and $S$: $G = S - 2T$.

Now, substitute this expression for $G$ into the first equation: $10T = 3S + (S - 2T)$.

Simplify the equation: $10T = 4S - 2T$.

Combine like terms: $12T = 4S$.

Divide both sides by 4: $3T = S$.

This tells us that the weight of 1 Squig is equal to the weight of 3 Treeks. Therefore, the number of Treeks whose combined weight is equal to the weight of one Squig is 3.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem is solved, and we have found that the combined weight of 3 Treeks is equal to the weight of one Squig.

We are given two polynomials and their product. We need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ by comparing the coefficients of the product with the given polynomial $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we will expand the product of the two polynomials $(3t^2+5t+a)$ and $(4t^2+bt-2)$:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
12t^4 + (3b+20)t^3 + (-6+5b+4a)t^2 + (-10+ab)t - 2a.
\]
We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $t$:
\[
\begin{cases}
3b + 20 = 26, \\
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8, \\
-10 + ab = -16, \\
-2a = 6.
\end{cases}
\]

[ADVANCE]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we solve the equation $-2a = 6$ for $a$:
\[
a = -3.
\]
Next, we substitute $a = -3$ into the equation $-10 + ab = -16$:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2.
\]
We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by checking the other equations. Substituting $b = 2$ into the equation $3b + 20 = 26$:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26,
\]
which is true. Finally, we substitute $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into the equation $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8,
\]
which is also true. Therefore, our values of $a$ and $b$ are correct.

Now, we can find the value of $a + b$:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1.

The problem involves finding the largest value of $a$ such that the graph of the piecewise function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once. The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{wenn } x \geq a,\\
ax +2a& \text{wenn } x <a,
\end{cases}
\]
We need to analyze the behavior of the function for both cases ($x \geq a$ and $x < a$) and determine the condition on $a$ that ensures the graph intersects every horizontal line.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line, we need to consider the range of the function. For the function to intersect every horizontal line, the range of $f(x)$ must be all real numbers, i.e., $(-\infty, \infty)$.

First, let's analyze the case when $x \geq a$. The function is $f(x) = ax^2$, which is a quadratic function. Since $x \geq a$, the minimum value of $f(x)$ in this case occurs at $x = a$, and it is $f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3$.

Next, let's analyze the case when $x < a$. The function is $f(x) = ax + 2a$, which is a linear function. The value of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left is $f(a^-) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$.

For the function to intersect every horizontal line, the range of the function must cover all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of the quadratic part ($a^3$) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of the linear part ($a^2 + 2a$), and the linear part must be able to take on any value less than $a^3$.

We need to find the largest value of $a$ such that the function $f(x)$ can take on any real value. This implies that the minimum value of the quadratic part should be less than or equal to the value of the linear part at $x = a$.

So, we need to solve the inequality $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$. We also need to ensure that the function is continuous or has a gap that doesn't exceed the range of real numbers.

Let's solve the inequality $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$.

\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \]
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \]

We need to find the intervals where the inequality holds true. The critical points are $a = -1, 0, 2$. We can test the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(2, \infty)$ to determine where the inequality is satisfied.

By testing a point in each interval, we can determine that the inequality is satisfied in the intervals $[-1, 0]$ and $[0, 2]$. Since $a$ is a number that we are looking for, and we want the largest value, we consider the interval $[0, 2]$.

The largest value of $a$ in the interval $[0, 2]$ is $2$. We need to verify that $a = 2$ satisfies the condition that the graph of $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line.

Next action: [VERIFY]

[VERIFY]

We have determined that the largest value of $a$ is $2$, but we need to verify that this value indeed ensures that the graph of $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line.

For $a = 2$, the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{wenn } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4& \text{wenn } x <2.
\end{cases}
\]

We need to check the range of the function. For $x \geq 2$, the minimum value of $f(x) = 2x^2$ is $f(2) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8$. For $x < 2$, the value of $f(x) = 2x + 4$ approaches $f(2^-) = 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8$ as $x$ approaches $2$ from the left.

The linear part $2x + 4$ can take on any value less than $8$, and the quadratic part $2x^2$ can take on any value greater than or equal to $8$. Therefore, the range of the function is $[8, \infty) \cup (-\infty, 8) = (-\infty, \infty)$, which means the graph of $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line.

Thus, our conclusion that the largest value of $a$ is indeed $2$ is correct.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires finding the largest value of $a$ such that the graph of the piecewise function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once. We analyzed the function for both cases ($x \geq a$ and $x < a$), determined the range of the function, and solved the inequality to find the largest value of $a$. After verifying the result, we conclude that the largest value of $a$ is $\boxed{2}$.

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the given circle equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1.

To solve this, we need to rewrite the circle equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). We will complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

[ADVANCE]

1. Complete the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

2. Complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

3. Substitute the completed square terms back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of the circle equation is \((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\). We know the radius \( r \) is 1, so we can set up the equation:
\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]
\[ 1^2 = 34 - c \]
\[ 1 = 34 - c \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the values of \( \lambda \) that satisfy the given conditions, we need to first compute \( f(f(x)) \). We start by finding \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We are given that \( f(f(x)) = x \), so we set up the equation:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This equation must have a solution \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \).

Next, we need to solve this equation for \( \lambda \). However, solving this equation directly can be complex, so we will consider the fixed points of the function \( f(x) \) and then analyze the condition \( f(f(x)) = x \).

The fixed points of \( f(x) \) are given by \( f(x) = x \), which means:
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions: \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \). For \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \) to be in the interval \( [0,1] \), we need \( 0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1 \). Since \( \lambda > 0 \), the inequality simplifies to \( 0 \le \lambda - 1 \le \lambda \), which further simplifies to \( 1 \le \lambda \le \infty \). However, we are given that \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \), so we consider \( 1 \le \lambda \le 4 \).

Next, we need to find the values of \( \lambda \) for which there exists an \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \) but \( f(f(x)) = x \). We will analyze the equation \( f(f(x)) = x \) for \( \lambda \) in the range \( 1 \le \lambda \le 4 \).

We can use the fact that if \( f(x) = y \), then \( f(y) = x \). This means that \( f(x) \) and \( x \) are swapped under the function \( f \). We need to find the values of \( \lambda \) for which this swapping occurs without \( f(x) = x \).

By analyzing the function and the given conditions, we can conclude that the value of \( \lambda \) that satisfies the given conditions is \( \lambda = 2 \).

The problem requires finding the measure of the smallest positive angle $\theta$ such that the given expression for $\tan \theta$ holds. The expression involves trigonometric functions of various angles, and we need to simplify it to find $\theta$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We start by simplifying the given expression for $\tan \theta$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identity, we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{85^\circ - 25^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator. We can rewrite it using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the difference-to-product identity, we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the expression for $\tan \theta$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
Since $\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}$, we need to find the smallest positive angle $\theta$ that satisfies this equation. We know that $\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}$, so the smallest positive angle $\theta$ is:
\[
\theta = 120^\circ.

where \(n\) is the total number of objects to arrange, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct objects.

- Total number of letters, \(n = 7\)

Then, \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \cos \phi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

We need to verify that the maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) can indeed be achieved within the given constraints. Since \( \theta, \phi \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \), the sum \( \theta + \phi \) can range from \( -\pi \) to \( \pi \). Therefore, \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \) is a valid possibility.

When \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \), we have \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \). Then, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \). We need to check if these values of \( x \) and \( y \) satisfy the original constraints \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), which they do since \( \sin \theta \) and \( \cos \theta \) are both within the interval \( [-1, 1] \).

\[ \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^3 = z^3 + 3z + \frac{3}{z} + \frac{1}{z^3} \implies z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = a^3 - 3a = a(a^2 - 3) = a(a + 1 - 3) = a(a - 2) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 \right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} \right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \left( \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(-3 + \sqrt{5})}{4} = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5} - 3\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We observe that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) follows a recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let's denote \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = F_n \). We have:

The recurrence relation for \( F_n \) is \( F_{n+1} = a F_n - F_{n-1} \). However, we can also use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the quadratic equation \( t^2 - at + 1 = 0 \), where \( a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). The roots of this equation are \( z = e^{i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), where \( \cos \theta = \frac{a}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

Using De Moivre's theorem, we have:
\[ z^n = e^{in\theta} \text{ and } \frac{1}{z^n} = e^{-in\theta}, \]
\[ z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = 2 \cos (n\theta). \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos (85\theta) \). Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we can find the value of \( \theta \) and then compute \( \cos (85\theta) \).

[ADVANCE]

We know that \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) corresponds to a specific angle \( \theta \). By using the properties of the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence, we can find that \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \) (this can be derived from the fact that the golden ratio is related to the pentagon and the angle \( \frac{2\pi}{5} \)).

Now, we can compute \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos (85 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{5}) = 2 \cos (34\pi) = 2 \cos (0) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \).

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \( \boxed{-1} \).

To do this, we need to express the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10, which is $2 \cdot 5$.

The problem involves selecting two numbers randomly from the first six prime numbers and finding the probability that their sum is even. The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

[ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that the sum of the two selected numbers is even, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.

Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the remaining five numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, and 13) are odd.

[ADVANCE]

We can calculate the total number of possible outcomes when two numbers are chosen from the six prime numbers. Since each person chooses a number independently, the total number of outcomes is $6 \times 6 = 36$.

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the two numbers is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.

Since there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers, the number of ways to choose two even numbers is $1 \times 1 = 1$, and the number of ways to choose two odd numbers is $5 \times 5 = 25$.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is $1 + 25 = 26$.

The probability that the sum of the two selected numbers is even is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability is $\frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}$.

\[ 11100 \div 450 = 24.6667 \]

Since 11100 is not an integer multiple of 450, we need to consider the next smallest number. The next candidate would be a number with a larger sum of digits that is a multiple of 9 and ends in 00.

The next number to consider is 11111100. Let's verify if 11111100 is a multiple of 450.

\[ 11111100 \div 450 = 24691.3333 \]

Since 11111100 is not an integer multiple of 450, we continue to the next candidate. The sum of the digits of 11111100 is 6, which is not a multiple of 9. We need a larger number.

The next candidate is a number with even more 1s. We need to find the correct number of 1s that will give us a sum that is a multiple of 9. After some trial and error, we find that the number 11111111100 has a digit sum of 10 + 9 = 18, which is a multiple of 9.

The problem involves determining the probability of a game piece landing on a shaded square of a chessboard after two random spins of a wheel. Each spin can result in a number between 1 and 4 for the first spin (determining the column) and 1 to 5 for the second spin (determining the row). We need to calculate the probability of landing on a shaded square.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Since the first number can be any of 1, 2, 3 (determined by dividing the result of the first spin by 4), and the second number can be any of 1, 2, 3, 4 (determined by dividing the result of the second spin by 5), there are $3 \times 4 = 12$ possible outcomes for the column and row combinations.

Next, we need to identify the shaded squares on the chessboard. A standard chessboard has 64 squares, alternating between shaded and unshaded. Half of the squares are shaded, so there are 32 shaded squares.

However, we need to determine the probability of landing on a shaded square based on the column and row combinations determined by the spins. We will assume that the shading pattern of the chessboard is such that half of the columns and half of the rows are shaded, resulting in half of the total squares being shaded.

Since each column and row combination is equally likely, we can calculate the probability of landing on a shaded square by considering the proportion of shaded squares on the chessboard. Given that half of the squares are shaded, the probability of landing on a shaded square is simply the proportion of shaded squares.

Next, we can calculate the probability:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaded squares}}{\text{Total number of squares}} = \frac{32}{64} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

However, we need to verify if the shading pattern affects the probability based on the column and row combinations determined by the spins.

Next action: [VERIFY]

[VERIFY]

Upon re-examining the problem, we realize that the shading pattern of the chessboard is not explicitly described. However, we can infer that the shading pattern is regular, with half of the squares being shaded in a checkerboard manner.

Given that the first spin determines the column (1, 2, 3) and the second spin determines the row (1, 2, 3, 4), we can list out all possible column-row combinations and determine which ones correspond to shaded squares.

Let's assume the top-left corner of the chessboard is shaded (i.e., column 1, row 1 is shaded). We can then determine the shaded squares by following the checkerboard pattern.

The possible column-row combinations are:
(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)

Following the checkerboard pattern, the shaded squares would be:
(1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3)

There are 6 shaded squares out of the 12 possible combinations.

Therefore, the probability of landing on a shaded square is:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaded squares}}{\text{Total number of combinations}} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Our initial assumption of the probability being $\frac{1}{2}$ based on the proportion of shaded squares on the chessboard was correct.

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to pair up the terms in the product. Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ).
\]
Since $\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ$, and $\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ$, the product simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ) = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}$. Now, we need to find the product of the remaining terms.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x$ to simplify the product. Let's apply this identity to the terms $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Now, we need to find the product $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ)$. We can rewrite it as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

The problem provides an equation in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta, z)$, which is $z = c$, where $c$ is a constant. We need to determine the geometric form described by this equation.

In cylindrical coordinates, $r$ is the radial distance from the $z$-axis, $\theta$ is the angular coordinate in the $xy$-plane, and $z$ is the height above the $xy$-plane. The equation $z = c$ indicates that the height above the $xy$-plane is constant.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since the height $z$ is constant, it means that for any value of $r$ and $\theta$, the $z$-coordinate remains the same. This describes a plane that is parallel to the $xy$-plane and intersects the $z$-axis at $z = c$.

Therefore, the equation $z = c$ represents a plane in 3-dimensional space.

The problem involves finding the smallest possible angle between two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ given their magnitudes and the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$.

We are given:
- $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2$
- $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7$
- $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is related to the magnitudes of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ and the sine of the angle $\theta$ between them by the formula:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

First, we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we can use the formula for the magnitude of the cross product to find $\sin \theta$:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta \implies 7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle $\theta$ whose sine is $\frac{1}{2}$ is $30^\circ$ or $150^\circ$. Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, the answer is $30^\circ$.

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, we can express $g(x)$ as $g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015$.

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Specifically, for a cubic polynomial of the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the sum of the roots is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are shifted versions of the roots of $f(x)$. If the roots of $f(x)$ are $r_1, r_2, r_3$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is given by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $-(-49) = 49$. Therefore, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 5 - 5 - 5 = 34$.

The problem requires us to compute the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\), we can further rewrite the expression as:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to proceed.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ.

So the expression becomes:
\[

We need to find the sum of the squares of the tangents of these angles.

We can use the identity for the sum of squares of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. For angles \(10^\circ\), \(50^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), which are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of \(40^\circ\), we can use the known result:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

The problem involves finding the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all but one of its interior angles is $1070^{\circ}$.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. If the sum of all but one of the interior angles is $1070^{\circ}$, then the sum of all the interior angles must be $1070^{\circ}$ plus the measure of the missing interior angle.

Let's denote the measure of the missing interior angle as $x$. Then, the sum of all the interior angles is $1070^{\circ} + x$. According to the formula, this sum is also equal to $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[1070^{\circ} + x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}.\]

Since $x$ is an interior angle of a convex polygon, we know that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$. We can use this information to find the range of possible values for $n$.

[ADVANCE]

Rearrange the equation to solve for $x$:
\[x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}.\]
Since $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$, we can set up the inequality:
\[0^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}.\]
We can split this into two inequalities:
\[0^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ},\]
\[(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}.\]

Solve the first inequality:
\[(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} > 1070^{\circ},\]
\[n-2 > \frac{1070^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}},\]
\[n-2 > 5.9444,\]
\[n > 7.9444.\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \geq 8$.

Solve the second inequality:
\[(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1070^{\circ} + 180^{\circ},\]
\[(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ},\]
\[n-2 < \frac{1250^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}},\]
\[n-2 < 6.9444,\]
\[n < 8.9444.\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \leq 8$.

Combining the two results, we get:
\[8 \leq n \leq 8.\]
Therefore, the only possible value for $n$ is 8.

The problem requires finding an unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start with the congruence equation given in the problem:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find that \( 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Next, we substitute these values back into the expression for \( t \):
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer, we discard \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \) and keep \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}\) is \(\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\), we can simplify the expression as follows:

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \quad \text{for} \quad x > 0.
\]

For \(x < 0\), we have:

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

However, we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) to simplify the expression. Since \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\), we have:

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This simplification is valid for \(x > 0\). Now, we can substitute this into the original equation:

\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), the equation becomes:

\[
1 = \frac{1}{3},
\]

which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that \(x > 0\) is incorrect. We need to reconsider the case for \(x < 0\).

However, we can also consider the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) and the fact that the sine function is periodic. We can rewrite the equation as:

\$
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1,

but this is not equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\). We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's use the identity \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\) and consider the general solution for \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{3}\).

We know that \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{3}\) has solutions \(\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) + 2k\pi\) or \(\theta = \pi - \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) + 2k\pi\), where \(k\) is an integer.

Since \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\), we can set:

\[
\frac{\pi}{2} = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi - \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) + 2k\pi.
\]

However, the first equation is a contradiction, and the second equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This is also a contradiction. We need to reconsider the problem.

Let's use the fact that \(\tan^{-1} (x) = \theta\) implies \(x = \tan \theta\) and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \theta\). We can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\sin \left( \theta + \theta \right) = \frac{1}{3} \quad \text{or} \quad \sin (2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(x = \tan \theta\), we can use the double-angle identity for sine:

\$
\sin (2\theta) = \frac{2\tan \theta}{1 + \tan^2 \theta} = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2}.

So, the equation becomes:

\$
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.

We can solve this equation for \(x\):

6x = 1 + x^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.

x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

\text{Distance} = \frac{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|}.
\]
First, we need to compute the cross product:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we calculate the magnitude of this cross product:
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]
We also need the magnitude of the direction vector:
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]
Now, we can find the distance:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

We can expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ using the distributive property of the cross product:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.\]
Using the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, we get:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}).\]
Since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, the expression simplifies to:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).\]
We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so we can substitute this into the expression:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the average price of Juan's 70's stamps, we need to calculate the total cost of the 70's stamps and then divide it by the total number of 70's stamps.

From the table, the number of stamps from each country in the 70's is:
- Brasilien: 12 stamps
- Frankreich: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spanien: 13 stamps

The prices for each country are:
- Brasilien and Frankreich: 6 Cent
- Peru: 4 Cent
- Spanien: 5 Cent

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 70's stamps:
- Cost of Brasilien stamps: $12 \times 6 = 72$ Cent
- Cost of Frankreich stamps: $12 \times 6 = 72$ Cent
- Cost of Peru stamps: $6 \times 4 = 24$ Cent
- Cost of Spanien stamps: $13 \times 5 = 65$ Cent

The total cost of the 70's stamps is: $72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233$ Cent

The total number of 70's stamps is: $12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43$

Now, we can calculate the average price of the 70's stamps:
\[
\text{Average price} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total number of stamps}} = \frac{233}{43} \approx 5.4186

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$. The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is given as 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, we can conclude that $\triangle ACB \cong \triangle ACD$ by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) postulate. This is because $\angle BAC = \angle CAD$ (since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$), $\angle ACB = \angle ACD$ (since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$ and $\overline{AC}$ is a transversal), and they share the side $\overline{AC}$.

Since $\triangle ACB \cong \triangle ACD$, the areas of these two triangles are equal. Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Then the area of $\triangle ACB$ is also $x$.

The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ACB$. Therefore, we have:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ACB] = x + x = 2x
\]
Given that $[ABCD] = 42$, we can set up the equation:

The problem is to solve the equation $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$ for $x$.

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:
\[
2\sqrt{2x} = 3\sqrt{3x-1}
\]
Next, we can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(2\sqrt{2x})^2 = (3\sqrt{3x-1})^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9(3x-1)
\]
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Now, we can isolate $x$ by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]
\[
-19x = -9
\]
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

[VERIFY]
We need to check if the solution $x = \frac{9}{19}$ satisfies the original equation and ensures that the expressions under the square roots are non-negative.
First, we check the expression under the square root in the original equation:
\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} \geq 0
\]
\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0
\]
Since both expressions are non-negative, the solution is valid. Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{9}{19}$ back into the original equation to verify:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{19}}}{\frac{\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

To find the value of $\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21}$, we will use the given operation definition: $\frac{m}{n}@\frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)$. Here, $m=7$, $n=30$, $p=10$, and $q=21$. Plugging these values into the operation, we get:

The problem involves determining the probability that two randomly chosen segments $AB$ and $CD$ on the circumference of a circle intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use geometric probability. Let's consider the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ on the circle. We can fix the points $A$ and $C$ and then consider the relative positions of $B$ and $D$.

Without loss of generality, let's place $A$ at the top of the circle and $C$ at some position on the circle. The segment $AB$ will span an arc from $A$ to $B$, and the segment $CD$ will span an arc from $C$ to $D$. For the segments $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, the points $B$ and $D$ must be positioned such that the arcs $AB$ and $CD$ overlap.

We can think of the circle as a unit circle with a circumference of $360^\circ$. When we place $A$ and $C$, the position of $C$ relative to $A$ can be any angle between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$. Now, we need to find the probability that $B$ and $D$ are positioned such that the segments intersect.

By symmetry and geometric probability, it can be shown that the probability of the segments intersecting is $\frac{1}{3}$.

([ADVANCE]

To confirm this, we can use a more rigorous approach. Let's consider the circle as a unit circle with a circumference of $360^\circ$. We can fix point $A$ at the top of the circle and point $C$ at some position on the circle. The key insight is that the order of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ around the circle determines whether the segments intersect.

We can think of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ as being arranged in a specific order around the circle. The total number of possible orderings of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ is $4! = 24$. However, we are only interested in the relative positions of the points, so we can consider the order of the points $B$ and $D$ with respect to $A$ and $C$.

For the segments $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, the points $B$ and $D$ must be on opposite sides of the line segment joining $A$ and $C$. This means that the points $B$ and $D$ must be in one of the two possible orderings: $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ or $A$, $D$, $C$, $B$ (or their cyclic permutations).

There are exactly 4 such orderings out of the 24 possible orderings, which correspond to the segments intersecting. Therefore, the probability that the segments intersect is $\frac{4}{24} = \frac{1}{6} \times 2 = \frac{1}{3}$.

3. Express the area of the shaded region in terms of the central angle: The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle. Let the measure of the central angle $\angle ADC$ be $\theta$ radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 \cdot \theta = 2\theta$, and the area of the sector of the smaller circle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta$. The area of the shaded region is the difference between these two areas: $2\theta - \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{3}{2}\theta$.

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we know that \(\alpha\) is in the first quadrant, so \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we know that \(\beta\) is in the first quadrant, so \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta

Substituting the values we have:

\[

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from the 14 people (8 Republicans and 6 Democrats). Then, we subtract the number of ways to form a committee with only Republicans or only Democrats.

The total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 people is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a committee with only Republicans:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, we calculate the number of ways to form a committee with only Democrats:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a committee with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a committee minus the number of ways to form a committee with only Republicans or only Democrats:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). The product of these integers is given by:
\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]
We also know that the product divided by the average of the three integers equals 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]
So, the given condition can be written as:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]
Which further simplifies to:
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]
So, we have:
\[
n^2 = 25
\]
This gives us two possible values for \(n\):
\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]

[ADVANCE]

We need to check which of these values of \(n\) satisfy the original equation \((n-1)n(n+1) = 120\).

For \(n = 5\):
\[
(5-1) \cdot 5 \cdot (5+1) = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]
This satisfies the equation.

For \(n = -5\):
\[
(-5-1) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-5+1) = (-6) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-4) = -120
\]
This does not satisfy the equation.

So, the valid solution is \(n = 5\). The three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The largest of these integers is \(6\).

 [OUTPUT]

The problem is to find the largest of three consecutive integers whose product is 120 and whose product divided by their average equals 24. We denoted the integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\), and used the given conditions to form equations. Solving these equations, we found that the valid solution is \(n = 5\), corresponding to the integers \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). Therefore, the largest of these integers is \(\boxed{6}\).

The problem requires solving for the positive value of \( x \) in the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
\]
This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62
\]
Since the problem specifies the positive value of \( x \), we discard the negative solution.

[OUTPUT]

The positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\) is \(\boxed{66}\).

The problem requires simplifying the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left (\frac {4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} - 2 \pi \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

So the expression becomes \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\) to simplify the expression. Let's multiply and divide the expression by \(\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)\) to use the double-angle identity for sine.

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}
\]

Using the double-angle identity \(\sin (2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \sin \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}
\]

Using the double-angle identity again:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}
\]

Since \(\sin (\pi + x) = -\sin x\) and \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} (-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)) (-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right))}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity again:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{16}

We are given an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with $AB = AC$ and height $AM = 11$. There is a point $D$ on $\overline{AM}$ such that $AD = 10$ and $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$. We need to find the perimeter of triangle $ABC$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote $\angle BAC = \theta$, then $\angle BDC = 3\theta$. Since $AM$ is the height of the triangle, $\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}$. We can use the fact that $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$ to find a relationship between the angles.

Since $D$ is on $\overline{AM}$ and $AD = 10$, we have $DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1$. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles and the sides of the triangle.

Consider $\triangle BDM$ and $\triangle BCM$. We have:
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{BM}{1} = BM
\]
and
\[
\tan \angle BCM = \frac{BM}{CM} = \frac{BM}{BM} = 1 \implies \angle BCM = 45^\circ.
\]
Since $\angle BDC = 3\theta$ and $\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta$, we have $\angle BCM = 90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}$. Equating the two expressions for $\angle BCM$, we get:
\[
90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2} = 45^\circ \implies \frac{3\theta}{2} = 45^\circ \implies \theta = 30^\circ.
\]
Now, we can find the length of $BM$. Since $\angle BAM = 15^\circ$ and $\angle ABM = 90^\circ$, we have $\angle ABM = 75^\circ$. Using the tangent function in $\triangle ABM$, we get:
\[
\tan 75^\circ = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11} \implies BM = 11 \tan 75^\circ.
\]
We know that $\tan 75^\circ = 2 + \sqrt{3}$, so:
\[
BM = 11(2 + \sqrt{3}).
\]
The length of $BC$ is $2BM = 22(2 + \sqrt{3})$. To find the length of $AB$, we use the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle ABM$:
\$
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + (11(2 + \sqrt{3}))^2 = 121 + 121(7 + 4\sqrt{3}) = 121(8 + 4\sqrt{3}) = 121 \cdot 4(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 484(2 + \sqrt{3}).
\]
Taking the square root, we get:
\$
AB = 22\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}.
\]
The perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \cdot 22\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}} + 22(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 44\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}} + 22(2 + \sqrt{3})$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can simplify the expression for the perimeter. First, we need to simplify $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}$. We can express $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}$ as $\sqrt{\frac{4 + 2\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{(\sqrt{3} + 1)^2}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Now, we can substitute this back into the expression for the perimeter:
\$
AB = 22 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{2} = 11(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}).
\]
The perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\$
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \cdot 11(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}) + 22(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 22(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}) + 22(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 22(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2} + 2 + \sqrt{3}).
\]
We can further simplify the expression by recognizing that $\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + 2 = (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})^2 = 2 + \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{6} + 2 = 2 + \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}$ is not a simple expression, but we can calculate the numerical value.

However, we can use the fact that the triangle is isosceles and the height is 11, and the point D is on the height, to find the perimeter using the properties of 30-60-90 triangle.

Since $\angle BAC = 30^\circ$, $\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 75^\circ$, and $\angle BDC = 90^\circ$, we can use the properties of 30-60-90 triangle to find the side length.

The length of $BC$ is $2BM = 22(2 + \sqrt{3})$. The length of $AB$ is $AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + (11(2 + \sqrt{3}))^2} = 22$.

The perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \cdot 22 + 22(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 44 + 44 + 22\sqrt{3} = 88 + 22\sqrt{3}$.

The problem requires finding the real values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We need to break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

[ADVANCE]
First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factorize the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$ and $x^2 \geq 0$, we only consider $y \geq 0$. Therefore, the inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ holds true for $0 \leq y < 3$. Substituting back $y = x^2$, we get $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which simplifies to $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factorized as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ and it is equal to 0 only when $x^2 = -2$ (which has no real solutions), the inequality $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ is satisfied for all real $x$.

[ADVANCE]
Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. The solution to the first inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, and the solution to the second inequality is all real $x$. Therefore, the intersection of these solutions is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z &= 12.
\end{align*}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,$ we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we need to express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in terms of $xy + yz + zx.$ We can use the identity:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $x + y + z$ by $p$ and $xy + yz + zx$ by $q.$ Then, we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = p^2 - 2q.\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 2q - q) = p(p^2 - 3q).\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We also have the equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be factored as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[xy(p - z) + xz(p - y) + yz(p - x) = 12,\]
where $p = x + y + z.$ Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[p(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $q = xy + yz + zx$ and $xyz = 4,$ we have:
\[pq - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[pq - 12 = 12,\]
so
\[pq = 24.\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We now have two equations:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q)\]
and
\[pq = 24.\]
We can solve for $q$ in terms of $p$ from the second equation:
\[q = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = p\left(p^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{p}\right) = p\left(p^2 - \frac{72}{p}\right) = p^3 - 72.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[p^3 = 64,\]
so
\[p = 4.\]
Now, substituting $p = 4$ back into the equation $pq = 24,$ we get:
\[4q = 24,\]
so
\[q = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $q = 6.$

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which can be written as \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator \(x(x-36)\) and the points where the expression inside the absolute value is zero, i.e., \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

However, we must note that the expression is undefined when the denominator is zero, so \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\).

[ADVANCE]

To solve the inequality, we need to consider the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into the following intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied.

[ADVANCE]

For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{(-10)(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{(-1)(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{(1)(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 18\):
\[
\frac{|(18-9)(18+9)|}{(18)(18-36)} = \frac{|(9)(27)|}{(18)(-18)} = \frac{243}{-324} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
\[
\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{(40)(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{(40)(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

From the above tests, we see that the inequality is satisfied in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the inequality is strict (<), we do not include the endpoints.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as $L$ and the width of the rectangle as $W$. The two semicircles together form a full circle with a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is $W$. The circumference of this circle is $\pi W$.

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two sides of the rectangle and the circumference of the circle:
\[ L + L + \pi W = 400 \]
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We need to express the area of the rectangle, $A$, in terms of one variable. The area of the rectangle is given by:
\[ A = L \cdot W \]

From the equation $2L + \pi W = 400$, we can express $L$ in terms of $W$:
\[ 2L = 400 - \pi W \]
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for $L$ into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $W$, set it to zero, and solve for $W$:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
\[ \pi W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Now, we need to find the corresponding value of $L$:
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} \]
\[ L = 200 - 100 \]
\[ L = 100 \]

The area of the rectangle is:
\[ A = L \cdot W \]
\[ A = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} \]
\[ A = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Therefore, the maximum area of the field is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{20000}{\pi}} \]

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this side as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, $\sin T = \frac{\text{opposite side to } T}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{s}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

Therefore, the value of $\sin T$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.

The problem asks for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. We need to express this distance in the form $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$ and find the sum $a+b$.

[ADVANCE]

The distance $D$ between the origin $(0,0)$ and a point $(x,y)$ on the graph can be expressed using the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
Since the point lies on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$, we can substitute $y$ in the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^2-3\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9\right)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's define:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
We take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
This gives us the critical points $x = 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$, and $x = -\sqrt{2}$.

[ADVANCE]

We evaluate $f(x)$ at these critical points to find the minimum value:
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, which occurs at $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $x = -\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the minimum distance $D$ is:
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The distance is in the form $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Thus, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

The problem involves finding the inverse function values for a piecewise function \( f(x) \) and then summing those values. The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:

\right. \]
We need to find \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find \( f^{-1}(0) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \). We will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 0 \), which gives \( x = 3 \). This value satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \). Factoring out \( x \), we get \( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x \neq 0 \), so we need to solve \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). The discriminant of this quadratic equation is \( 2^2 - 4(-1)(3) = 4 + 12 = 16 \), which is positive, so there are real solutions. However, we can check if there are any solutions greater than 3 by using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \). This gives \( x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2} \), which yields \( x = -1 \) or \( x = 3 \). Since neither of these solutions is greater than 3, there is no solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) in the case \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, to find \( f^{-1}(6) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \). Again, we will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 6 \), which gives \( x = -3 \). This value satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), so one possible solution is \( x = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \), which gives \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \). We can use trial and error or numerical methods to find the roots, but we can also check if there are any obvious integer solutions. By inspection, \( x = 2 \) is not a solution, and since \( x > 3 \), we can try \( x = 3 \) as a boundary value, but it's not valid since \( x > 3 \). We can also check \( x = 6 \) by substituting it into the equation: \( -6^3 + 2(6^2) + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \), which is not zero. However, we can use the Rational Root Theorem or numerical methods to find that \( x = 2 \) is not a solution, but \( x = 3 \) is a boundary and we need to check for \( x > 3 \). We find that \( x = 2 \) is not a solution, but we can use numerical methods or further algebraic manipulation to find that \( x = 2 \) is not the solution but we have \( x = -3 \) from the other part.

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we need to calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \).

\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{0}\).

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to the other five vertices. We need to use the properties of a regular octahedron to solve this problem.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of the octahedron is constant. Let the distances from point $P$ to the six vertices be $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$. We are given $a = 3, b = 7, c = 8, d = 9,$ and $e = 11$, and we need to find $f$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of the octahedron is constant, so we can write:
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = \text{constant}.\]

Since the octahedron is regular, the constant is the same for any point $P$. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices.

The sum of the squares of the given distances is:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324.\]

Let the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex be $f$. Then, we have:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + f^2 = 324 + f^2.\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of the octahedron is constant, we can set up the equation:
\[324 + f^2 = 324 + f^2 = 324 + f^2 = 324 + f^2 = 324 + f^2 = 324 + f^2.\]

We know that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. For a regular octahedron, this sum is equal to $6 \times (\text{side length})^2$. However, we don't need to calculate the side length because the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant, we can simply find the value of $f$ by using the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances is constant:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + f^2 = 324.\]

We already calculated the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 324 - f^2.\]

So, we have:
\[324 - f^2 = 324 - f^2.\]

Solving for $f^2$, we get:
\[f^2 = 324 - 324 + f^2 = 324 - 324.\]

We need to find the value of $f$:
\[f^2 = 36.\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[f = \sqrt{36} = 6.\]

Therefore, the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex is $\boxed{6}$.

The problem involves comparing the accelerations of a Softball and a Baseball when thrown with the same force. We need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that Force (F) is equal to Mass (m) times Acceleration (a), or \( F = ma \).

Given:
- Mass of the Softball, \( m_S = 200 \) g
- Mass of the Baseball, \( m_B = 150 \) g
- The force applied to both balls is the same, \( F_S = F_B \)

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the Softball to the acceleration of the Baseball, \( \frac{a_S}{a_B} \).

[ADVANCE]
Since the force applied to both balls is the same, we can set up the equation:
\[ F_S = F_B \]
\[ m_S a_S = m_B a_B \]
Substituting the given masses:
\[ 200 \, \text{g} \cdot a_S = 150 \, \text{g} \cdot a_B \]
To find the ratio of the accelerations, we can rearrange the equation:
\[ \frac{a_S}{a_B} = \frac{150 \, \text{g}}{200 \, \text{g}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

The problem asks us to find the number of identical digits in the base-7 and base-8 representations of the decimal number $629_{10}$.

First, we need to convert the decimal number $629_{10}$ to its base-7 and base-8 representations.

[ADVANCE]

To convert $629_{10}$ to base-7, we perform the following divisions:
\[ 629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
\[ 89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
So, the base-7 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1556_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base-8, we perform the following divisions:
\[ 629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
\[ 9 \div 8 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
So, the base-8 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1165_8$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we compare the base-7 representation $1556_7$ and the base-8 representation $1165_8$ to find the identical digits.

The digits in the base-7 representation are 1, 5, 5, 6.
The digits in the base-8 representation are 1, 1, 6, 5.

We see that the digits 1, 5, and 6 appear in both representations.

To find the number of handshakes, we need to consider the interaction between the Hexen and the Zauberer. Since each of the 6 Hexen will shake hands with each of the 10 Zauberer, we can calculate the total number of handshakes by multiplying the number of Hexen by the number of Zauberer.

To find the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial $p(x)$ is equal to $p(1)$. Therefore, we need to find $g(1)$, which is equivalent to $f(1-1) = f(0)$.

Since $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2$, we have:
\[

2. Fünf Bleistifte und ein Jumbo-Radiergummi kosten $\$1.82$.

Let's denote the cost of a single Bleistift as $B$ dollars and the cost of a Jumbo-Radiergummi as $R$ dollars. We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

\[
3B + R = 1.24
\]
\[
5B + R = 1.82
\]

Our objective is to find the value of $B$ in dollars and then convert it to cents.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can solve the system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $R$:

\[
(5B + R) - (3B + R) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
\[
2B = 0.58
\]
\[
B = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]

So, the cost of a single Bleistift is $0.29$ dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.29 \times 100 = 29
\]

Therefore, the cost of a single Bleistift is $\boxed{29}$ cents.

The problem asks for the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\frac{137}{500}$.

To solve this, we need to convert the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$ into its decimal form and then identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point.

[ADVANCE]

To convert $\frac{137}{500}$ into a decimal, we can perform the division. However, it's often easier to manipulate the fraction to have a denominator that is a power of 10, which simplifies the conversion to a decimal.

We can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000} = 0.274
\]

Now, we have the decimal representation of $\frac{137}{500}$ as 0.274.

[ADVANCE]

From the decimal representation 0.274, we can see that the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point is 4.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\frac{137}{500}$ is $\boxed{4}$.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. We need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to $O$ than to any vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region within the rectangle where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining a vertex to the center $O$ will divide the rectangle into regions where points are closer to $O$ or to the vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the line segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will intersect at the center $O$ and will form a smaller rectangle whose sides are parallel to the sides of the original rectangle $ABCD$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the line segments joining the center $O$ to the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle.

The area of the smaller rectangle will be the region where a point is closer to $O$ than to any of the vertices. Since the smaller rectangle is similar to the original rectangle and is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle, its side lengths will be half of the corresponding side lengths of the original rectangle.

Let the side lengths of the original rectangle $ABCD$ be $2a$ and $2b$, so the area of the original rectangle is $4ab$. The side lengths of the smaller rectangle will be $a$ and $b$, so the area of the smaller rectangle is $ab$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The probability is given by the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle. Since the area of the original rectangle is $4ab$ and the area of the smaller rectangle is $ab$, the probability is:
\[
\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

This probability is independent of the ratio $\frac{AB}{AD} = k$, so the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) at three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise, using the floor function for \( n \geq 4 \) and the ceiling function for \( n < 4 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) is less than 4, we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is equal to 4, we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the class average, we need to calculate the total score of all students and then divide it by the total number of students. The total score can be calculated by multiplying the number of students who achieved each score by the score itself and then summing these products.

The total score is:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Let's calculate the total score:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ \text{Total score} = 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

The problem presents a magic square, where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. We need to find the value of \( n \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\

\]

We can start by using the property of magic squares that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. Let's denote this common sum as \( S \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can start by calculating the sum of the first row:
\[ S = (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n - 1 \]

Next, we can calculate the sum of the second row:
\[ S = (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \]

Since the sum of each row is the same, we can set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[ 2n - 1 = 3n - 6 \]

We can solve this equation for \( n \):
\[ 2n - 1 = 3n - 6 \]
\[ -1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \]
\[ 5 = n \]

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 5 \).

Next action: [VERIFY]

We have found that \( n = 5 \). To verify this solution, we can substitute \( n = 5 \) back into the magic square and check if the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is indeed the same.

Substituting \( n = 5 \) into the magic square, we get:
\[

Now, we can calculate the sum of each row, column, and diagonal to verify that they are all equal:
- Sum of the first row: \( 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 \)
- Sum of the second row: \( 7 + 1 + 1 = 9 \) (This is not equal to 11, so we need to recheck our solution)

It seems that our solution \( n = 5 \) does not satisfy the condition of a magic square. We need to re-evaluate our approach.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's re-evaluate the sum of the rows, columns, and diagonals. We can use the first column to find the common sum \( S \):
\[ S = (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1 \]

We can also use the second column to find the common sum \( S \):
\[ S = 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6 \]

Since the sum of each column is the same, we can set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[ 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]

We can solve this equation for \( n \):
\[ 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]
\[ 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \]
\[ 7 = n \]

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \).

\]

Now, we can calculate the sum of each row, column, and diagonal to verify that they are all equal:
- Sum of the first row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the first column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)

1. Calculate the distance traveled by Jim, who goes diagonally across the field. This distance is the diagonal of the rectangle, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: 
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

3. Find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:

The problem involves finding the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) given that \(\omega^3 = 1\), where \(\omega\) is a complex number.

[ADVANCE]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}\). They satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We can use this property to simplify the given expression. First, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]
Since \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{2 + (-1)}{2 + (-1)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
However, we need to consider the case when \(\omega = 1\), because in that case, the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is not defined. When \(\omega = 1\), the expression becomes \(\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\).

So, the expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity except when \(\omega = 1\), but even in the case of \(\omega = 1\), the value of the expression is 1.

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is 1.
