We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of $DE$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can substitute the given value: $0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}$. Solving for $DF$, we get $DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10$.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$: $DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2$. Substituting the known values, we get $DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2$. Simplifying, we have $DE^2 + 49 = 100$, so $DE^2 = 51$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $DE = \sqrt{51}$.

The value of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given a complex number $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and another complex number $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$ which is the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in the counterclockwise direction.

To solve this, we can use the concept of complex number rotation. The rotation of a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$ can be achieved by the formula:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]
where $e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$. For $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, we have $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to calculate $z - c$ first:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \]

Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) - 3 \sqrt{2} i \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = (1 + i) - 3i (1 + i) \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 \]
\[ = 1 - 2i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Finally, we add $c$ to the result to get $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

The problem asks us to simplify $\sqrt{242}$. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can divide 242 by 2, the smallest prime number, to get:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]
Next, we recognize that 121 is a perfect square, specifically:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root expression:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves arranging 8 people around a round table, with the constraint that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We need to account for the circular permutation and the fact that the arrangement of the 3 people together can be considered as a single unit.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can treat the group of 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) who want to sit together as a single unit or ""block."" This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the 5 individual people plus the block of 3) around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange the 6 units around the round table is $(6-1)! = 5!$.

Within the block of 3 people, there are $3!$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the round table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is $5! \times 3!$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the value of $5! \times 3!$.

$5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$
$3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

So, the total number of ways is $120 \times 6 = 720$.

Since the problem states that two dispositions are considered identical if one is a rotation of the other, we have already accounted for this by using the formula for circular permutations.

The problem asks for the term constant in the development of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}x^{3(5-k)}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{-2k}
\]
Simplifying the exponents of \(x\), we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero, so we set \(15-5k = 0\) and solve for \(k\):
\[
15-5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
Thus, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{3}10^{5-3}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3x^{15-5\cdot3} = \binom{5}{3}10^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3x^0
\]
Calculating the value, we have:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5\cdot4}{2} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]
So, the constant term is:
\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]
Now, we need to find the remainder when $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8$ is divided by 7. We can simplify this step by step:
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]
So, we have:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 3 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}

Next, we simplify $3 \cdot 8$:

The problem asks for the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise around its center to coincide with its original position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by $(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ$. Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is $\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ$.

The exterior angle of a regular pentagon, which is the angle at each vertex when traveling around the pentagon, is $180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ$. Since the pentagon is rotated counterclockwise, we need to find the smallest multiple of this exterior angle that equals $360^\circ$, which is a full rotation.

[ADVANCE]

To find the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $72n = 360$. We can solve for $n$ by dividing $360$ by $72$.

\[ n = \frac{360}{72} = 5 \]

This means the pentagon must be rotated $5$ times its exterior angle to coincide with its original position. The minimum number of degrees is therefore $72 \times 5 = 360$ degrees, but we are asked for the rotation in terms of the exterior angle itself, which is the smallest unit of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position.

So, the pentagon must be rotated by $72 \times 5 = 360$ degrees, but the smallest unit of rotation is the exterior angle itself, which is $72$ degrees, and it needs to be rotated $5$ times this angle to get back to the original position, but the question seems to be asking for the angle of rotation, which is the exterior angle itself for the minimum rotation to get a coincident position relative to the original, which is the same as the answer choice format.

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated is $\boxed{72}$.

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram given the coordinates of the other three vertices. The coordinates of the vertices are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and $(x, y)$, with the constraint that $x > 7$. We need to use the properties of a parallelogram to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
Now, let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and $(x, y)$:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 6$ is not a valid solution. This means we need to reconsider the pairs of vertices used to form the diagonals.

Next, let's consider the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8), and the diagonal formed by vertices (7, 4) and $(x, y)$:
The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (7, 4) and $(x, y)$ is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 4$ is not a valid solution. This means we need to consider the last pair of vertices.

Finally, let's consider the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4), and the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and $(x, y)$:
The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and $(x, y)$ is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
We already solved this case and found $x = 6$, which is not valid.

Let's consider the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and (7, 4), and the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and $(x, y)$:
The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and (7, 4) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and $(x, y)$ is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
Solving the second equation for $y$:
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]
Since $x = 8 > 7$, this solution is valid. Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are $(8, 9)$.

The value of $x + y$ is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

The problem involves finding the asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \) and then summing the values of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting the factored form equal to zero gives us the vertical asymptotes:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can find the sum \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

The problem asks us to calculate $99^2 + 99 + 1$ mentally. We need to find a way to simplify this expression to make the calculation easier.

[ADVANCE]

We can start by recognizing that $99^2 + 99 + 1$ is close to the expression $(99+1)^2$, but not quite. Let's rewrite the expression to see if we can simplify it:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \left(99 + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}.\]
However, this approach seems to be making the calculation more complicated. Instead, let's try to use the fact that $99$ is close to $100$ to simplify the calculation.

We can calculate $99^2$ as $(100-1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801$.
Then, we add $99$ to $9801$ to get $9801 + 99 = 9900$.
Finally, we add $1$ to $9900$ to get $9901$.

To approach this problem, we need to understand how the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}$ transforms a vector $\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ and then find the maximum factor by which the matrix can scale the vector.

[ADVANCE]

Let's compute the product of the matrix and the vector $\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The magnitude of this resulting vector is:
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]
We want to find the maximum value of the ratio $\frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$, which represents the factor by which the matrix scales the vector $\bold{v}$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the ratio $\frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$, we can use the fact that this ratio is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix $A^T A$, where $A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}$.

First, we compute the matrix $A^T A$:
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of $A^T A$ are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0$:
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation, we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
So, the eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = 16$ and $\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = 1$.

The maximum eigenvalue of $A^T A$ is 16, so the maximum value of the ratio $\frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$ is $\sqrt{16} = 4$.

Therefore, the smallest real positive number $C$ for which the inequality holds is $C = 4$.

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express this equation as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. Factoring the left-hand side, we get $(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0$. Given that $z \neq 1$, it follows that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$.

The problem requires simplifying the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

[ADVANCE]

We start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\), since \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). The expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) to simplify the numerator:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

The problem involves converting the weights of different objects (treeks, squigs, and goolees) into a common unit. We are given two equations relating the weights of these objects:
1. One treek weighs the same as three squigs and one goolee.
2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig.

We need to find out how many treeks are equivalent in weight to one squig.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote the weight of one treek as $T$, the weight of one squig as $S$, and the weight of one goolee as $G$. We can translate the given information into the following equations:
1. $T = 3S + G$
2. $2T + G = S$

We can use these equations to express $T$ in terms of $S$.

First, we'll solve the second equation for $G$:
\[ G = S - 2T \]

Next, we'll substitute this expression for $G$ into the first equation:
\[ T = 3S + (S - 2T) \]
\[ T = 4S - 2T \]
\[ 3T = 4S \]
\[ T = \frac{4S}{3} \]

This equation tells us that the weight of one treek is $\frac{4S}{3}$, where $S$ is the weight of one squig. To find out how many treeks are equivalent in weight to one squig, we can set up the equation:
\[ xT = S \]
where $x$ is the number of treeks equivalent to one squig. Substituting $T = \frac{4S}{3}$ into this equation, we get:
\[ x \cdot \frac{4S}{3} = S \]
\[ x = \frac{3S}{4S} \]
\[ x = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, the weight of $\frac{3}{4}$ of a treek is equal to the weight of one squig. Since we can't have a fraction of a treek, we can interpret this as the weight of one squig being equivalent to the weight of $\frac{3}{4}$ of a treek.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires us to find the number of treeks equivalent in weight to one squig. We set up equations based on the given information, solved for the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of one squig, and then found the number of treeks equivalent to one squig.

The problem involves finding the values of $a$ and $b$ by comparing the product of two polynomials with a given polynomial. We need to identify the coefficients of the resulting polynomial and match them with the given polynomial $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We start by expanding the product of the two polynomials $(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2)$. The expanded form is:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We can now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
\1. $3b + 20 = 26$ (from the $t^3$ term)
\2. $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$ (from the $t^2$ term)
\3. $-10 + ab = -16$ (from the $t$ term)
\4. $-2a = 6$ (from the constant term)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we solve equation (4) for $a$:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]
Next, we substitute $a = -3$ into equation (3):
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]
We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by substituting them into equation (1):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26 \quad \text{(True)}
\]
Finally, we substitute $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into equation (2) to ensure consistency:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \quad \text{(True)}

Our values of $a$ and $b$ are correct. Now, we can find $a + b$:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

The problem requires finding the values of $a$ and $b$ by comparing the product of two polynomials with a given polynomial.

The problem involves finding the radius of a cylindrical reservoir based on the rate at which it is being filled with water and the rate at which the water level is rising.

Given:
- The reservoir is being filled at a rate of $20\pi$ m³/h.
- The water level is rising at a rate of 4 m/h.

We need to find the radius of the reservoir.

[ADVANCE]

The volume $V$ of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.

The rate at which the volume is changing with respect to time is $\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi$ m³/h.

The rate at which the height is changing with respect to time is $\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$ m/h.

We can use the chain rule to relate the rate of change of volume to the rate of change of height:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Since $V = \pi r^2 h$, we have $\frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2$. Substituting this into the chain rule equation, we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

[ADVANCE]

We can now solve for $r^2$:
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2
\]
Dividing both sides by $4\pi$:
\[
r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}

We need to find the largest value of $a$ such that the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once. This means that the function $f(x)$ must be surjective, i.e., for every $y$, there exists an $x$ such that $f(x) = y$.

The function $f(x)$ is defined piecewise:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{si } x \geq a,\\
ax +2a& \text{si } x <a.
\end{cases}
\]

We need to analyze both cases to ensure that the function intersects every horizontal line.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line, we need to check the range of the function for both $x \geq a$ and $x < a$.

1. For $x \geq a$, the function is $f(x) = ax^2$. Since $x \geq a$, the minimum value of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = a$, which gives $f(a) = ax^2 = a \cdot a^2 = a^3$. As $x$ increases from $a$ to $\infty$, $f(x) = ax^2$ increases from $a^3$ to $\infty$. Therefore, the range of $f(x) = ax^2$ for $x \geq a$ is $[a^3, \infty)$.

2. For $x < a$, the function is $f(x) = ax + 2a$. This is a linear function with slope $a$. The value of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left is $f(a^-) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$. As $x$ decreases from $a$ to $-\infty$, $f(x) = ax + 2a$ decreases from $a^2 + 2a$ to $-\infty$ if $a > 0$, or increases from $a^2 + 2a$ to $\infty$ if $a < 0$. Therefore, the range of $f(x) = ax + 2a$ for $x < a$ is $(-\infty, a^2 + 2a]$ if $a > 0$, or $[a^2 + 2a, \infty)$ if $a < 0$.

To ensure that the function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line, the range of $f(x)$ for $x \geq a$ and $x < a$ must cover the entire real line. This means that the range $[a^3, \infty)$ and the range $(-\infty, a^2 + 2a]$ (for $a > 0$) must overlap, or the range $[a^3, \infty)$ and the range $[a^2 + 2a, \infty)$ (for $a < 0$) must overlap.

Next, we need to find the condition on $a$ such that the ranges overlap.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line, we need to find the condition on $a$ such that the ranges of the two pieces of the function overlap.

For $a > 0$, the range of $f(x) = ax^2$ for $x \geq a$ is $[a^3, \infty)$, and the range of $f(x) = ax + 2a$ for $x < a$ is $(-\infty, a^2 + 2a]$. For these ranges to overlap, we need $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$. Simplifying this inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out $a$, we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
Since $a > 0$, we can divide the inequality by $a$ without changing the direction of the inequality:
\[ (a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the quadratic are $a = 2$ and $a = -1$. Since $a > 0$, we consider the interval $0 < a \leq 2$.

For $a < 0$, the range of $f(x) = ax^2$ for $x \geq a$ is $[a^3, \infty)$, and the range of $f(x) = ax + 2a$ for $x < a$ is $[a^2 + 2a, \infty)$. For these ranges to overlap, we need $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$ or $a^2 + 2a \leq a^3$. However, since $a < 0$, the term $a^3$ will be more negative than $a^2 + 2a$, and it's difficult to find a specific range for $a$ without further analysis.

Next, we need to verify the maximum value of $a$ that satisfies the inequality for $a > 0$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

From the previous step, we have determined that for $a > 0$, the inequality $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$ must be satisfied. The solution to this inequality is $0 < a \leq 2$.

To find the largest value of $a$ that satisfies this inequality, we take the upper bound of the interval, which is $a = 2$.

We need to verify that $a = 2$ indeed satisfies the condition that the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once.

For $a = 2$, the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{si } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4& \text{si } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]

The range of $f(x) = 2x^2$ for $x \geq 2$ is $[8, \infty)$, and the range of $f(x) = 2x + 4$ for $x < 2$ is $(-\infty, 8]$. The ranges overlap at $y = 8$, and together they cover the entire real line.

Therefore, the largest value of $a$ such that the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once is $\boxed{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the given conditions, we need to analyze the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\). First, let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We want \(f(f(x)) = x\), so we set up the equation:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This equation is quite complex, so let's simplify it step by step. We can start by considering the case where \(f(x) = x\), because we want \(f(x) \neq x\). So, we first solve \(f(x) = x\):
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions: \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). Since \(x \in [0,1]\), we need to ensure that \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \in [0,1]\). For \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\), we need \(\lambda \ge 1\), and for \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\), we need \(\lambda \ge 0\), which is already given. So, we have \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) as fixed points of \(f(x)\).

Next, we need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) where \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). We can substitute \(y = f(x)\), so \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then, \(f(y) = x\) becomes \(f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x\).

We need to solve this equation for \(\lambda\). Let's consider the quadratic nature of \(f(x)\) and the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\). We can use the fact that \(f(x)\) is a quadratic function and analyze the fixed points and the behavior of the function.

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's consider the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\) and the fact that \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\). We can substitute \(y = f(x)\) into the equation \(f(y) = x\), which gives us \(f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x\).

To simplify the analysis, let's consider the case where \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). Then, \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}\). Substituting \(y = \frac{\lambda}{4}\) into the equation \(f(y) = x\), we get:
\[ f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}. \]
This gives us the equation:
\[ \frac{\lambda}{4} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \]
\[ \frac{\lambda}{4} - \frac{\lambda^2}{16} = \frac{1}{2}, \]
\[ \lambda - \frac{\lambda^2}{4} = 2, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 8 = 0. \]
This is a quadratic equation in \(\lambda\). We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[ \lambda = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 32}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 4i}{2} = 2 \pm 2i. \]
Since \(\lambda\) is a real number, the solution \(\lambda = 2 \pm 2i\) is not valid.

Next, we need to consider other possible values of \(\lambda\). Let's analyze the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\) again. We can rewrite it as:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This equation is satisfied if \(f(x) = x\) or \(f(x) = 1 - x\). We already know the solutions to \(f(x) = x\), so let's consider the case \(f(x) = 1 - x\):
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = 1 - x, \]
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = 1 - x, \]
\[ \lambda x^2 - (\lambda + 1)x + 1 = 0. \]
For this quadratic equation to have a solution in \([0,1]\), the discriminant must be non-negative:
\[ (\lambda + 1)^2 - 4\lambda \ge 0, \]
\[ \lambda^2 + 2\lambda + 1 - 4\lambda \ge 0, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1 \ge 0, \]
\[ (\lambda - 1)^2 \ge 0. \]
This inequality is always true for any real \(\lambda\). So, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the quadratic equation \(\lambda x^2 - (\lambda + 1)x + 1 = 0\) has a solution in \([0,1]\) and \(f(x) \neq x\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the quadratic equation \(\lambda x^2 - (\lambda + 1)x + 1 = 0\) has a solution in \([0,1]\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's solve the quadratic equation:
\[ x = \frac{(\lambda + 1) \pm \sqrt{(\lambda - 1)^2}}{2\lambda} = \frac{(\lambda + 1) \pm (\lambda - 1)}{2\lambda}. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = \frac{(\lambda + 1) + (\lambda - 1)}{2\lambda} = \frac{2\lambda}{2\lambda} = 1, \]
\[ x = \frac{(\lambda + 1) - (\lambda - 1)}{2\lambda} = \frac{2}{2\lambda} = \frac{1}{\lambda}. \]
We need to check if these solutions are in the interval \([0,1]\) and if \(f(x) \neq x\).

For \(x = 1\), we have \(f(1) = \lambda \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0 \neq 1\), so \(x = 1\) is a valid solution.

For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we need \(\frac{1}{\lambda} \in [0,1]\), which implies \(\lambda \ge 1\). We also need to check if \(f\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \neq \frac{1}{\lambda}\):
\[ f\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda} \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}. \]
For \(f\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \neq \frac{1}{\lambda}\), we need \(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{1}{\lambda}\), which implies \(\lambda \neq 2\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the given conditions are \(\lambda \in [1, 4]\) except \(\lambda = 2\).

Substituting these into the denominator, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} (\sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ) - \frac{1}{2} (\sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ) + \frac{1}{2} (\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ) - \frac{1}{2} (\sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ).

Simplifying the expression, we get:

\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} (2 \sin 25^\circ - 2 \sin 85^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identity:
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
we get:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
We know that $\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}$, so the smallest positive angle $\theta$ is:
\[

The problem asks for the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"". This is a permutation problem with repeated letters. The word ""ELLIPSE"" has 7 letters in total, with 2 letters ""L"" and the other letters being distinct.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"", we use the formula for permutations of a multiset: $\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of objects to arrange, and $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ are the frequencies of the distinct objects.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"", we have:
- Total letters, $n = 7$
- Frequency of ""L"", $n_1 = 2$
- Frequencies of ""E"", ""P"", ""I"", ""S"" are all 1

So, the number of distinct arrangements is $\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{2!}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we calculate the value of $\frac{7!}{2!}$:
\[ 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \]
\[ 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

The problem asks for the number of trailing zeros in $42!$ (42 factorial). To determine this, we need to find the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since $10 = 2 \times 5$, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, we need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To count the number of times 5 is a factor in $42!$, we can use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$, which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For $42!$ and $p = 5$, we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let's set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

So, we can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives us \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Therefore, the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) \) is \( \boxed{1} \).

We need to find the area of triangle $OAB$ given the position vectors of points $O$, $A$, and $B$. The formula to find the area of the triangle formed by two vectors $\overrightarrow{u}$ and $\overrightarrow{v}$ is $\frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v}\|$, where $\times$ denotes the cross product and $\|$ denotes the magnitude of the vector.

[ADVANCE]

The vectors $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$ are given as $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, respectively. To find the area of the triangle, we need to calculate the cross product of $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$.

The cross product of two vectors $\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:
\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\ u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\ u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) - (3)(-2) \\ (3)(-3) - (1)(1) \\ (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ -9 - 1 \\ -2 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}.
\]
The area of the triangle $OAB$ is then:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}.

We are given a complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We need to find the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = a \), where \( a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We recognize that \( a \) is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation \( a^2 = a + 1 \).

We can use the recurrence relation for the powers of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \):
\[ z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right) = a \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right). \]

Starting with \( n = 2 \):
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 - 2 = a + 1 - 2 = a - 1. \]

For \( n = 3 \):
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = a \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) - \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) = a (a - 1) - a = a^2 - 2a = (a + 1) - 2a = 1 - a. \]

For \( n = 4 \):
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = a \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) - \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = a (1 - a) - (a - 1) = a - a^2 - a + 1 = 1 - a^2 = 1 - (a + 1) = -a. \]

For \( n = 5 \):
\[ z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = a \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) - \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) = a (-a) - (1 - a) = -a^2 - 1 + a = -(a + 1) - 1 + a = -2. \]

For \( n = 6 \):
\[ z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = a \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) - \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) = a (-2) - (-a) = -2a + a = -a. \]

We observe that \( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = -a \) and \( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = -2 \). This suggests a periodicity in the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) with a period of 12, since \( z^{12} + \frac{1}{z^{12}} = z^0 + \frac{1}{z^0} = 2 \) and the sequence will repeat.

[ADVANCE]

To find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we can reduce the exponent modulo 12:
\[ 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}. \]
Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

We are given a triangle $ABC$ with medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ intersecting at the centroid $G$. We need to find the area of triangle $ENG$ given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144.

[ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. We also know that the centroid divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these smaller triangles is $\frac{1}{6}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$.

The area of triangle $ABC$ is 144, so the area of each of the six smaller triangles is $\frac{144}{6} = 24$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $NG$ is parallel to $BC$, triangle $ENG$ is similar to triangle $EBG$ by the AA similarity criterion. The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since $NG$ is parallel to $BC$ and $G$ is the centroid, $NG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of $BC$. Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle $ENG$ to the area of triangle $EBG$ is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}$.

However, we need to find the area of triangle $ENG$ in terms of the area of triangle $ABC$. We know that the area of triangle $EBG$ is $\frac{1}{6}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$, which is 24.

[ADVANCE]

Since the area of triangle $EBG$ is 24 and the ratio of the area of triangle $ENG$ to the area of triangle $EBG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ (not $\frac{1}{9}$ for the whole triangle but for the height, the area ratio is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the $\frac{1}{2}$ of the base, so $\frac{1}{6}$ of the total area of EBC, which is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total area of ABC), the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $EBG$, which is $\frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8$.

The problem involves finding the total surface area of the shaded region in a rectangle formed by 12 unit squares. The rectangle has a length of 4 units and a width of 3 units. The shaded region consists of two right-angled triangles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the total surface area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the area of each triangle and then sum them up. The first triangle has a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units, and the second triangle has a base of 1 unit and a height of 4 units.

The area of the first triangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

The area of the second triangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 4 = 2

The total surface area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:

The problem asks for the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1. To solve this, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 450. Since $450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2$, the number must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25 to be a multiple of 450.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00, since it is a multiple of 25 and it can only contain the digits 0 and 1.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be a multiple of 9. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of the digits must be a sum of ones that is a multiple of 9.

Given these conditions, the smallest number that meets these criteria is 11100, but we need to verify if it is indeed a multiple of 450.

[VERIFY]

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2.
2. **Check divisibility by 25**: 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
3. **Check divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of 11100 is $1+1+1+0+0 = 3$, which is not a multiple of 9. Therefore, 11100 is not a multiple of 450.

Since 11100 does not meet the criteria, we need to find the next smallest number that meets all the conditions. The next possible number would be 11111100, but we need to check if it is a multiple of 9.

The sum of the digits of 11111100 is $1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 6$, which is not a multiple of 9. We need to continue searching for the smallest number.

The next possible number is 11111111100, let's check if it is a multiple of 9.

The sum of the digits of 11111111100 is $1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9$, which is a multiple of 9.

Since 11111111100 meets all the conditions (divisibility by 2, 25, and 9), it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1.

The smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1 is $\boxed{11111100}$.

# The wheel is divided into 12 equal sections, so each number has a probability of $\frac{1}{12}$ of being selected.

  - Numbers 4, 8, 12 give a remainder of 0, but since the columns are labeled 1, 2, 3, we can consider 0 as not being a valid remainder for the columns, so we have 3 numbers for each valid remainder.
# The probability of landing on a column that corresponds to a valid remainder (1, 2, or 3) is $\frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}$, but since we are only interested in the remainders 1, 2, and 3, we can consider the probability of landing on a valid column as $\frac{3}{4}$.

  - Column 3 (remainder 3) and row 2 (remainder 2): The numbers that give a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 are 3, 13, but since the wheel only goes up to 12, we have only 3.
  - Column 6 (remainder 2) and row 4 (remainder 4): The numbers that give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 are 6, 16, but since the wheel only goes up to 12, we have only 6.
# The probability of landing on a shaded square is the sum of the probabilities of these two combinations:
  - The probability of landing on column 3 and row 2 is $\frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{144}$ (for number 3) plus the probability of other numbers that give the same remainders, which is $\frac{3}{12} \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{144}$ (for numbers 3, 11).

The problem requires finding the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$. To solve this, we need to first simplify the fraction by converting the denominator to a power of 10, which will give us a finite decimal representation.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's calculate the value of the denominator:
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000.\]
So, the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}.\]
To convert this fraction to a decimal, we can perform the division:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605.\]
Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation $0.00021605$.

[ADVANCE]

The decimal representation is $0.00021605$. To find the sum of the digits, we ignore the decimal point and sum the digits:
\[0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14.\]

The problem requires finding the product of sines of several angles. We need to identify any patterns or use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to pair up the terms in the product. Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ).
\]
Since $\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ$, and $\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ$, the product simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ) = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}$. Now, we need to find the product of the remaining terms.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x$ to simplify the product. Let's apply this identity to the terms $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Now, we need to find the product $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ)$. We can rewrite it as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) represents the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis, \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane measured from the positive \(x\)-axis, and \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height \(z\) is constant, regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This means that for any value of \(r\) and \(\theta\), the \(z\)-coordinate remains the same.

Since the height \(z\) is constant and does not depend on \(r\) or \(\theta\), the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a distance \(c\) from it.

We need to find the smallest angle possible between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.

Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:

The problem involves two polynomial functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

The function $f(x)$ is given by $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$. The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term and $a$ is the leading coefficient.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are the values of $x$ such that $f(x + 5) = 0$. If $r_1, r_2, r_3$ are the roots of $f(x)$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$. The sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is therefore $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15$.

From Vieta's formulas for the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the sum of the roots of $g(x)$:
\[
(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34.

The expression becomes \(\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

\[

We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\). We can use the identity \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan\).

\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 70^\circ

\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ

So the expression becomes:
\[

Since \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), we have:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \cdot \tan 50^\circ \cdot \tan 70^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}

We also know the identity:

for \(x = 10^\circ\), we have:

The problem involves finding the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$. We need to use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}$, where $n$ is the number of sides.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$. The sum of all interior angles of the polygon would be $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}$. Since the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, the measure of the remaining angle must be $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}$. Since this is an interior angle of the polygon, it must be less than $180^{\circ}$.

We can set up the following inequality to represent this:
\[
0 < (n-2) \times 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}
\]

[ADVANCE]

First, we solve the inequality:
\[
0 < (n-2) \times 180 - 1070 < 180
\]
We split this into two parts:
\[
0 < (n-2) \times 180 - 1070 \quad \text{and} \quad (n-2) \times 180 - 1070 < 180
\]
Solving the first part:
\[
1070 < (n-2) \times 180
\]
\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2
\]
\[
5.94 < n-2
\]
\[
7.94 < n
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \geq 8$.

Solving the second part:
\[
(n-2) \times 180 - 1070 < 180
\]
\[
(n-2) \times 180 < 1250
\]
\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]
\[
n-2 < 6.94
\]
\[
n < 8.94
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \leq 8$.

Combining both parts of the inequality, we get:
\[
8 \leq n \leq 8

Thus, $n = 8$.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the congruence as:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
This can be rearranged into a standard quadratic form:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

We find that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 18^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Substituting \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) into the equation \( t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \), we get:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer, we consider \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

The problem involves finding the total surface area of a cube given its volume. The volume of the cube is $1$ cubic foot. We need to convert this volume to cubic inches because the answer is requested in square inches. We know that $1$ foot is equal to $12$ inches, so $1$ cubic foot is equal to $12^3 = 1728$ cubic inches.

The volume of a cube is given by $s^3$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the cube. We can set up the equation $s^3 = 1728$ to find the side length of the cube in inches.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We need to solve for $s$ in the equation $s^3 = 1728$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $s = \sqrt[3]{1728} = 12$ inches. Now that we have the side length of the cube, we can find the total surface area. The total surface area of a cube is given by the formula $6s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the cube.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the total surface area of the cube using the side length $s = 12$ inches. The total surface area is $6s^2 = 6 \times 12^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864$ square inches.

This sequence is an arithmetic progression (AP) where the first term $a_1$ is 1 and the common difference $d$ is 2.

The general formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic progression is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

We need to find the 2003rd term, so we will substitute $n = 2003$, $a_1 = 1$, and $d = 2$ into the formula.

Using the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic progression, we substitute the values $n = 2003$, $a_1 = 1$, and $d = 2$:

The problem involves solving the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). We need to find all values of \(x\) that satisfy this equation.

[ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}\) is \(\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\), we can simplify the expression inside the sine function.

For \(x > 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

For \(x < 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

However, we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

So, the original equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have:
\[
1 = \frac{1}{3},
\]
which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption about the range of \(x\) must be reconsidered in the context of the equation.

However, we can directly use the identity to conclude that the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) simplifies to \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is not possible. This implies that there might be an error in the interpretation or the equation itself might not have a solution in the real numbers.

The equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) simplifies to \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no real solutions to the equation.

The problem involves finding the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The lines are given in vector form, and we need to use the formula for the distance between parallel lines.

The first line is defined by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
The second line is defined by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Since the lines are parallel, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so the lines are indeed parallel.

[ADVANCE]

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula:
\[d = \frac{\left|(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \cdot \mathbf{n}\right|}{\|\mathbf{n}\|},\]
where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{n}\) is the vector normal to the direction vector of the lines.

We can take \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) as points on the lines. The direction vector is \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

The vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\) is:
\[\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]

The distance formula becomes:
\[d = \frac{\left| \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2}} = \frac{\left| -16 - 63 - 10 \right|}{\sqrt{4 + 81 + 4}} = \frac{\left| -89 \right|}{\sqrt{89}} = \frac{89}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{89}.\]

The problem asks for the number of points with integer coordinates that are strictly inside a given rectangular region. The rectangular region has vertices at $(5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4)$.

To find the number of points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle, we need to determine the range of $x$ and $y$ coordinates that lie inside the rectangle. The $x$-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle range from $-5$ to $5$, but exclude the endpoints $-5$ and $5$. The $y$-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle range from $-4$ to $4$, but exclude the endpoints $-4$ and $4$.

Therefore, the range of $x$-coordinates inside the rectangle is from $-4$ to $4$, and the range of $y$-coordinates inside the rectangle is from $-3$ to $3$.

Next, we calculate the number of integer points within these ranges. The number of integer $x$-coordinates from $-4$ to $4$ is $4 - (-4) + 1 = 9$. The number of integer $y$-coordinates from $-3$ to $3$ is $3 - (-3) + 1 = 7$.

We can expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ using the distributive property of the cross product:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.

Using the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, we get:

\]
Since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, the expression simplifies to:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so we can substitute the given values:

Substituting $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$, we get:

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ bisects the angle $\angle BAD$. We also know that the area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects the angle $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, we can infer that $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle with $\angle ACD = 90^\circ$. Let's denote the intersection of $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{AD}$ as point $A$, the intersection of $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BC}$ as point $C$, and the intersection of $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ as points $D$ and $B$ respectively.

Let the length of $\overline{AC}$ be $h$ and the length of $\overline{AD}$ be $b_1$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of both $\triangle ACD$ and the trapezoid $ABCD$, we can use the area formula for a trapezoid: 
\[ [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h, \]
where $b_2$ is the length of $\overline{BC}$. We also know that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is:
\[ [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times h. \]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{AD}{DC}. \]
Let $DC = b_2 - b_1$ and $AB = x$. Then, we have:
\[ \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{b_1}{b_2 - b_1}. \]
Also, since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[ [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_2 - b_1 + b_1) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b_2 \times h. \]
The area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$:
\[ [ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b_2 \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h. \]
Given that $[ABCD] = 42$, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h = 42. \]
We need to find the relationship between the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and the trapezoid $ABCD$. Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, the height $h$ is the same for both $\triangle ACD$ and the trapezoid. Let the area of $\triangle ACD$ be $x$. Then:
\[ [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times h = x. \]
The area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[ [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b_2 \times h = [ABCD] - x = 42 - x. \]
Since $\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{AD}{DC}$, we have:
\[ \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{b_1}{b_2 - b_1}. \]
Also, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$ is the same as the ratio of their bases:
\[ \frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{b_1}{b_2 - b_1}. \]
Substituting the areas, we get:
\[ \frac{x}{42 - x} = \frac{b_1}{b_2 - b_1}. \]
We also know that:
\[ \frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{x}{42 - x}. \]
Since $\frac{b_1}{b_2 - b_1} = \frac{x}{42 - x}$, we can substitute $b_2 = \frac{42 - x}{x} \times b_1$ into the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h = 42. \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \left(b_1 + \frac{42 - x}{x} \times b_1\right) \times h = 42. \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times \left(1 + \frac{42 - x}{x}\right) \times h = 42. \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times \frac{42}{x} \times h = 42. \]
Since $\frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times h = x$, we have:
\[ \frac{x}{x} \times 42 = 42. \]
This is an identity, so we need to find the value of $x$ using the ratio of the areas. Since the ratio of the areas is the same as the ratio of the bases, and the height is the same, we can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:
\[ x + (42 - x) = 42. \]
We also know that the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the bases, and since $\overline{AC}$ bisects the angle, the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the segments of the base:
\[ \frac{x}{42 - x} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{AD}{AD + DC} = \frac{b_1}{b_1 + (b_2 - b_1)} = \frac{b_1}{b_2}. \]
Since the trapezoid is divided into two triangles with the same height, the ratio of the areas is the same as the ratio of the bases:
\[ \frac{x}{42 - x} = \frac{b_1}{b_1 + (b_2 - b_1)} = \frac{b_1}{b_2}. \]
We can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is 42, and the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $x$, so the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $42 - x$. The ratio of the areas is:
\[ \frac{x}{42 - x} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{b_1}{b_2}. \]
Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of both triangles, the ratio of the areas is the same as the ratio of the bases:
\[ \frac{x}{42 - x} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{AD}{AD + DC} = \frac{AD}{BC}. \]
We can use the fact that the trapezoid is divided into two triangles with the same height, the ratio of the areas is the same as the ratio of the bases:
\[ \frac{x}{42 - x} = \frac{1}{1} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ or } \frac{2}{1}. \]
Since the trapezoid is divided into two triangles, the ratio of the areas is:
\[ \frac{x}{42 - x} = \frac{1}{1} = 1. \]

\[ x = 42 - x. \]

The problem is to solve the equation $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$ for $x$.

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:
\[
2\sqrt{2x} = 3\sqrt{3x-1}
\]
Next, we can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(2\sqrt{2x})^2 = (3\sqrt{3x-1})^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9(3x-1)
\]
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Now, we can isolate $x$ by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]
\[
-19x = -9
\]
Dividing both sides by $-19$ gives:
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]
We need to verify that this solution satisfies the original equation.

[VERIFY]
We need to check that the solution $x = \frac{9}{19}$ does not lead to any undefined expressions in the original equation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the expression under each square root is non-negative and that the denominator is non-zero.
\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} > 0
\]
\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0

Since both expressions under the square roots are positive and the denominator is non-zero, the solution $x = \frac{9}{19}$ is valid.

The problem defines an operation @ for two fractions $\frac{m}{n}$ and $\frac{p}{q}$ as $\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)$. We need to apply this operation to the fractions $\frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{10}{21}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We will substitute the values of the fractions into the operation definition. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Plugging these values into the operation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]
Now, we will calculate the value of the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, we multiply the numerators:
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]
Then, we multiply 70 by the fraction $\frac{21}{30}$:
\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = \frac{70 \cdot 21}{30} = \frac{1470}{30}
\]
We can simplify the fraction $\frac{1470}{30}$ by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 30:
\[
\frac{1470 \div 30}{30 \div 30} = \frac{49}{1} = 49
\]
So, the value of the expression is 49.

The problem involves determining the probability that two segments, $AB$ and $CD$, formed by four randomly chosen points on a circle intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to understand the condition for the segments to intersect. The segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if the four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are arranged such that one segment's endpoints are on opposite sides of the other segment. This means that the points must be arranged in an alternating manner, i.e., the points must be in the order $ACBD$ or $ADBC$ around the circle.

Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, we can consider the number of ways to arrange the four points. There are $4! = 24$ possible arrangements of the four points. However, only the arrangements where the points are in an alternating manner will result in intersecting segments.

[ADVANCE]

For any selection of 4 points on a circle, there are exactly 2 out of the 24 possible arrangements that will result in the segments intersecting ( namely, the arrangements $ACBD$ and $ADBC$). This is because for any choice of 4 points, we can fix one point and then the remaining 3 points can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways, but only 2 of these arrangements will result in intersecting segments.

Since the points are chosen randomly and the arrangements are equally likely, the probability that the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is therefore $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires finding the probability that two segments formed by four randomly chosen points on a circle intersect. By analyzing the condition for intersection and considering the number of favorable outcomes among all possible arrangements of the points, we conclude that the probability of the segments intersecting is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]

The problem requires evaluating the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\).

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), \(\alpha\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), \(\beta\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting the values of \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\), we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta)\):

The speed of the bicycle is given as 20 feet per minute. To convert this to inches per second, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Convert feet to inches: Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we multiply the speed in feet per minute by 12 to get the speed in inches per minute.

The problem requires us to find the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senate committee consisting of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary counting. We will first calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members, and then subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats.

The total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of members and $k$ is the number of members to be chosen. So, the total number of ways is $\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002$.

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans. Since there are 8 Republicans, the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans is $\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56$.

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Democrats. Since there are 6 Democrats, the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats is $\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6$.

The number of ways to form a subcommittee with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats. Therefore, the number of ways is $2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940$.

The problem involves finding three consecutive integers whose product is 120. Additionally, the product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24. We need to identify the largest of these three integers.

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\).

[ADVANCE]

The product of the three consecutive integers is given by:
\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]
The mean of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]
According to the problem, the product divided by the mean is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]
\[
n^2 = 25
\]
\[
n = \pm 5
\]
Since we are looking for integers, both \(n = 5\) and \(n = -5\) are potential solutions. We need to check which set of consecutive integers satisfies the original product condition.

[ADVANCE]

For \(n = 5\), the three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\). Let's check their product:
\[
4 \times 5 \times 6 = 120
\]
This satisfies the original condition.

For \(n = -5\), the three consecutive integers are \(-6, -5, -4\). Let's check their product:
\[
(-6) \times (-5) \times (-4) = -120
\]
This does not satisfy the original condition.

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\), and the largest of these integers is 6.

[OUTPUT]

The problem is to find the largest of three consecutive integers whose product is 120, and the product divided by their mean is 24. Through the steps of assessment, advancement, and verification, we found that the integers are \(4, 5, 6\), and the largest among them is \(\boxed{6}\).

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions:

\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote $\angle BAC = \theta$. Then, $\angle BDC = 3\theta$. Since $AM$ is the altitude, $\angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ$. We can use the fact that $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$ to find a relationship between the angles.

Since $\angle BDC = 3\theta$, we can use the fact that $\angle BDC = 180^\circ - \angle BDA$. Also, $\angle BDA = 180^\circ - \angle BDM - \angle ADM$. Since $\angle ADM = \theta$ (as $AM$ is the altitude and $\angle BAC = \theta$), we have $\angle BDA = 180^\circ - \angle BDM - \theta$.

We also know that $\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \theta$ (as $\angle BMA = 90^\circ$ and $\angle BAC = \theta$). Therefore, $\angle BDA = 180^\circ - (90^\circ - \theta) - \theta = 90^\circ$.

Now, we can use the fact that $\angle BDC = 3\theta$ and $\angle BDA = 90^\circ$ to find the value of $\theta$. We have $3\theta = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ$, so $\theta = 30^\circ$.

Next, we can use the value of $\theta$ to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Since $\angle BAC = 30^\circ$, we have $\angle BAM = 30^\circ$. Therefore, $\angle ABM = 60^\circ$, and triangle $ABM$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite the angles is $1 : \sqrt{3} : 2$. Since $AM = 11$, we have $BM = \frac{AM}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$. Therefore, $BC = 2BM = 2 \cdot \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

We also know that $AB = 2AM = 2 \cdot 11 = 22$ (as $AM$ is the altitude and $ABM$ is a 30-60-90 triangle).

Finally, the perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is $AB + BC + AC = 22 + \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3} + 22 = 44 + \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{132 + 22\sqrt{3}}{3} = \boxed{66}$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum is $3^7$, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the first and last term is $\frac{x + (x+26)}{2} = x+13$. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 3^7. \]

We can simplify this equation to solve for $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can simplify the equation $27(x+13) = 3^7$ by dividing both sides by 27. Since $27 = 3^3$, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ x+13 = \frac{3^7}{3^3} = 3^4 = 81. \]
Solving for $x$, we get:
\[ x = 81 - 13 = 68. \]

The sequence of 27 consecutive integers is $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$. Since the number of terms is odd (27), the median of the sequence is the middle term, which is the 14th term. The 14th term of the sequence is:

The problem requires finding the values of $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds. We need to break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

[ADVANCE]
First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factorize the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where this inequality is satisfied. The roots of the equation $(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0$ are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we know that $y \geq 0$. Therefore, we only consider the interval where $0 \leq y < 3$, which translates back to $0 \leq x^2 < 3$. This gives us $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factorized as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ and it is equal to 0 only when $x^2 = -2$ (which has no real solutions), the inequality $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ is satisfied for all real $x$.

[ADVANCE]
Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. The solution to the first inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, and the solution to the second inequality is all real numbers. Therefore, the intersection of these solutions is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

[OUTPUT]
The values of $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ is satisfied are $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

We are given a system of equations involving the variables $x,$ $y,$ and $z.$ The objective is to find the value of $xy + yz + zx.$ We have the following equations:
\begin{align*}
xyz &= 4, \\
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 &= 4, \\
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z &= 12.
\end{align*}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,$ we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we need to express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in terms of $xy + yz + zx.$ We can use the identity:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $x + y + z$ by $p$ and $xy + yz + zx$ by $q.$ Then, we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = p^2 - 2q.\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 2q - q) = p(p^2 - 3q).\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We also have the equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be factored as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[xy(p - z) + xz(p - y) + yz(p - x) = 12,\]
where $p = x + y + z.$ Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[p(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $q = xy + yz + zx$ and $xyz = 4,$ we have:
\[pq - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[pq - 12 = 12,\]
so
\[pq = 24.\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We now have two equations:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q)\]
and
\[pq = 24.\]
We can solve for $q$ in terms of $p$ from the second equation:
\[q = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = p\left(p^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{p}\right) = p\left(p^2 - \frac{72}{p}\right) = p^3 - 72.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[p^3 = 64,\]
so
\[p = 4.\]
Now, substituting $p = 4$ back into the equation $pq = 24,$ we get:
\[4q = 24,\]
so
\[q = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $q = 6.$

The value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $\boxed{6}.$

The problem provides a table with the percentage of boys and girls taking the bus in a survey at Central H.S. There are 300 boys and 300 girls in each grade level. We need to find the grade level where the number of boys taking the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of boys and girls taking the bus for each grade level, and then find the grade level where the number of boys taking the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus.

Let's calculate the number of boys and girls taking the bus for each grade level:

- For the $9^{\mathrm{th}}$ level:
  - Number of boys taking the bus = $41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3$
  - Number of girls taking the bus = $39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2$
  - $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus = $1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.47$

- For the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ level:
  - Number of boys taking the bus = $34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2$
  - Number of girls taking the bus = $33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3$
  - $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus = $1.35 \times 99.3 = 134.055$

- For the $11^{\mathrm{th}}$ level:
  - Number of boys taking the bus = $20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8$
  - Number of girls taking the bus = $13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4$
  - $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus = $1.35 \times 41.4 = 56.39$

- For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ level:
  - Number of boys taking the bus = $11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8$
  - Number of girls taking the bus = $8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8$
  - $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus = $1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.83$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the grade level where the number of boys taking the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus. We will calculate the absolute difference between the number of boys taking the bus and $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus for each grade level:

- For the $9^{\mathrm{th}}$ level:
  - Absolute difference = $|123.3 - 159.47| = 36.17$

- For the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ level:
  - Absolute difference = $|103.2 - 134.055| = 30.855$

- For the $11^{\mathrm{th}}$ level:
  - Absolute difference = $|61.8 - 56.39| = 5.41$

- For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ level:
  - Absolute difference = $|34.8 - 34.83| = 0.03$

The smallest absolute difference is for the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ level, which means the number of boys taking the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of girls taking the bus in the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ level.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which can be written as \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator \(x(x-36)\) and the points where the expression inside the absolute value is zero, i.e., \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

However, we must note that the expression is undefined when the denominator is zero, so \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\).

[ADVANCE]

To solve the inequality, we need to consider the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into the following intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied.

[ADVANCE]

For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{-10(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{-10(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{-1(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{-1(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{1(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 18\):
\[
\frac{|(18-9)(18+9)|}{18(18-36)} = \frac{|(9)(27)|}{18(-18)} = \frac{243}{-324} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
\[
\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{40(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{40(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

[ADVANCE]

From the above tests, we see that the inequality is satisfied in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). We also need to check the endpoints of the intervals. However, the inequality is strict (< 0), so the endpoints are not included.

Additionally, we need to exclude the points where the expression is undefined, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

[SYNTHESIZE]

Combining the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, we get the solution as \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

The problem involves finding the maximum area of a rectangular field surrounded by a running track. The track consists of two straight sides of the field and two semi-circular ends. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the radius of the semi-circular ends as \( r \) and the length of the straight sides as \( l \). The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semi-circular ends. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2l + 2\pi r = 400 \]
We need to express the area of the rectangular field in terms of \( r \) and \( l \), and then maximize this area.

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[ A = l \times 2r = 2rl \]
From the perimeter equation, we can express \( l \) in terms of \( r \):
\[ l = 200 - \pi r \]
Substituting this expression for \( l \) into the area equation, we get:
\[ A = 2r(200 - \pi r) = 400r - 2\pi r^2 \]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( r \), set it to zero, and solve for \( r \):
\[ \frac{dA}{dr} = 400 - 4\pi r = 0 \]
Solving for \( r \):
\[ 400 = 4\pi r \]
\[ r = \frac{100}{\pi} \]
To ensure this value of \( r \) corresponds to a maximum, we can check the second derivative:
\[ \frac{d^2A}{dr^2} = -4\pi \]
Since the second derivative is negative, the value \( r = \frac{100}{\pi} \) indeed corresponds to a maximum.

Now, we can find the corresponding value of \( l \):
\[ l = 200 - \pi \left(\frac{100}{\pi}\right) = 200 - 100 = 100 \]
Finally, we can calculate the maximum area:
\[ A = 2rl = 2 \left(\frac{100}{\pi}\right) (100) = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]
Thus, the maximum area of the rectangular field is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{20000}{\pi}} \]

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin{T}$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the length of the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin{R} = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ has length 2 and the hypotenuse has length 5.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the side adjacent to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this length as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we can find $\sin{T}$. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle $T$, the side opposite is the side that was adjacent to angle $R$, which has length $\sqrt{21}$, and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, $\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The value of $\sin{T}$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.

The problem asks for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. We need to find the minimum value of the distance function between the origin $(0,0)$ and a point $(x, y)$ on the graph.

The distance $D$ between the origin and a point $(x, y)$ is given by $D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the distance formula to get $D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2}$.

Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get $D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^2-3\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9\right)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}$.

To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$, since the square root function is monotonically increasing.

[ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero: $f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 0$.

Factoring out $2x$, we get $2x(x^2 - 2) = 0$. This gives us the critical points $x = 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$, and $x = -\sqrt{2}$.

We need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimum value of $f(x)$. We can do this by evaluating the second derivative $f''(x) = 6x^2 - 4$ at each critical point.

Evaluating the second derivative at the critical points, we get:
- $f''(0) = -4$, which is negative, indicating a local maximum.
- $f''(\sqrt{2}) = 6(\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8$, which is positive, indicating a local minimum.
- $f''(-\sqrt{2}) = 6(-\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8$, which is positive, indicating a local minimum.

Since $f(\sqrt{2}) = f(-\sqrt{2})$, we can evaluate $f(x)$ at $x = \sqrt{2}$ (or $x = -\sqrt{2}$) to find the minimum value: $f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}$.

The minimum value of the distance $D$ is then $\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$.

[SYNTHESIZE]

The problem asks for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$, which we found to be $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This can be expressed in the form $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$.

Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{

We will first find \( f^{-1}(0) \) by solving \( f(x) = 0 \) for both cases of the piecewise function.

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \), but neither of these satisfies the condition \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there is no valid solution for \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, we find \( f^{-1}(6) \) by solving \( f(x) = 6 \) for both cases of the piecewise function.

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
We can use numerical methods or inspection to find the roots of this cubic equation. By inspection, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not a solution since \( 2 \) is not greater than 3, and \( x = 3 \) is also not a solution for this case. We can try \( x = 6 \)：
\[ -6^3 + 2 \cdot 6^2 + 3 \cdot 6 - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \neq 0. \]
We can try \( x = 4 \):
\[ -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 - 6 = -64 + 32 + 12 - 6 = -26 \neq 0. \]
We can try \( x = 1.5 \) is not in the domain, so we try \( x = 6 \) again in the first case.
Since we have \( f(-3) = 6 \) for the first case, we don't need to solve the cubic equation.

So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to the other five vertices. We need to use the properties of a regular octahedron to solve this problem.

A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and the distance between any two adjacent vertices is the same. Let's denote the side length of the octahedron as $s$. The distance from any vertex to the center of the octahedron is $\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Let the coordinates of the vertices of the octahedron be $(\pm \frac{s}{2}, 0, 0)$, $(0, \pm \frac{s}{2}, 0)$, and $(0, 0, \pm \frac{s}{2})$. Assume the point $P$ has coordinates $(x, y, z)$.

The distances from $P$ to the five given vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We can write the equations for the squared distances from $P$ to these vertices:

\[
(x \mp \frac{s}{2})^2 + y^2 + z^2 = d_i^2
\]

where $d_i$ is the distance from $P$ to the $i$-th vertex, and the signs are chosen accordingly.

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant and equal to $4R^2 + 4r^2$, where $R$ is the distance from the center to a vertex, and $r$ is the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron.

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices is the same. Let the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex be $d_6$. Then we have:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 = 6 \left( \frac{s^2}{2} + r^2 \right)
\]

We also know that the distance from the center to a vertex is $\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so $R = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$. The distance from the center to the point $P$ is $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices is the same. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant and equal to $4R^2 + 4r^2$, where $R$ is the distance from the center to a vertex, and $r$ is the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron.

The sum of the squares of the given distances is:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Let the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex be $d_6$. Then we have:

\[
324 + d_6^2 = 6 \left( \frac{s^2}{2} + r^2 \right)
\]

We also know that:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 = 4 \left( \frac{s^2}{2} \right) + 4r^2

The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices is:

For a regular octahedron, $R = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so $R^2 = \frac{s^2}{2}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices is:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 = 4 \left( \frac{s^2}{2} \right) + 4r^2

We can simplify this equation to:

\[
324 + d_6^2 = 2s^2 + 4r^2

We also know that the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices is equal to $6 \left( \frac{s^2}{2} + r^2 \right)$, so:

\[

Equating the two expressions, we get:

Given:

- The force applied to both balls is the same.

We are asked to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball.

Since the force applied to both balls is the same, we can set up the equation:

First, we need to convert the decimal number $629_{10}$ to its base 7 and base 8 representations.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 7:
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 4
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation: $1554_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 8:
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.
\[

The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
\[ d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$:
\[ 2x - y - 2 = 0 \]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(6, 0)$, so $x_1 = 6$ and $y_1 = 0$.
Now, we can substitute these values into the distance formula:
\[ d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \]
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:
\[ d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5} \]

The polynomial equation is $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, for a polynomial $x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0$, the sum of the roots taken one at a time is $-a_3$, the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is $a_2$, the sum of the product of the roots taken three at a time is $-a_1$, and the product of the roots is $a_0$.

We are asked to find the set $\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = p$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = q$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = r$. We know that:
\[
p + q + r = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

We also know that:
\[
pq + qr + rp = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[

This can be simplified using the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2$ and the symmetric sums of the roots.

[ADVANCE]

We can also use the fact that:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = (-2)(-2) = 4.
\]
Since $p + q + r = 0$, we can let $p = x$, $q = y$, and $r = -x - y$. Then, we have:
\[
xy + y(-x - y) + (-x - y)x = -x^2 - y^2 - xy = - (x^2 + y^2 + xy).
\]
Also, we know that:
\[
xyz = - (x^2 + y^2 + xy)x y = 4.
\]
This implies that:
\[
-(x^2 + y^2 + xy) = -2,
\]
 so
\[
x^2 + y^2 + xy = 2.
\]
The set $\{x, y, -x - y\}$ can be found by solving the quadratic equation whose roots are $x$ and $y$. The quadratic equation is:
\[
t^2 - (x + y)t + xy = 0.
\]
We also know that:
\[
(x + y)^2 - xy = x^2 + y^2 + xy = 2.
\]
Let $s = x + y$ and $p = xy$. Then, we have:
\[
s^2 - p = 2.
\]
The set $\{x, y, -x - y\}$ is the set of roots of the quadratic equation $t^2 - st + p = 0$, and we also have the equation $t^2 + 2t + 2 = 0$ related to the original polynomial.

[ADVANCE]

By solving the equation $t^2 + 2t + 2 = 0$, we can find the roots:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2i}{2} = -1 \pm i.
\]
The product of the roots is $(-1 + i)(-1 - i) = 1 + 1 = 2$, which matches our earlier finding. The sum of the roots is $-2$, which also matches. Therefore, the set $\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}$ is $\{-1 + i, -1 - i, 2\}$.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. We need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to the center than to any vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region within the rectangle where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the center $O$ to a vertex will divide the rectangle into regions where points are closer to $O$ or to the vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will intersect at the center $O$ and will form a smaller rectangle whose sides are parallel to the sides of the original rectangle $ABCD$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the diagonals of the original rectangle.

The area of the region where a point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the area of this smaller rectangle. Since the smaller rectangle is formed by the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, its sides will be half the length of the diagonals of the original rectangle, which means its area will be one-half the area of the original rectangle.

However, we need to consider the ratio of the sides of the rectangle, given as $AB/AD = k$. This ratio will help us find the exact area of the smaller rectangle in terms of the area of the original rectangle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the length of $AB$ as $kx$ and the length of $AD$ as $x$. The area of the original rectangle $ABCD$ is then $kx \cdot x = kx^2$.

The diagonals of the rectangle $ABCD$ will have a length of $\sqrt{(kx)^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{k^2x^2 + x^2} = x\sqrt{k^2 + 1}$. The sides of the smaller rectangle will be half of the length of the diagonals, which is $\frac{x\sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2}$.

The area of the smaller rectangle is then $\left(\frac{x\sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2(k^2 + 1)}{4}$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle. This probability is $\frac{\frac{x^2(k^2 + 1)}{4}}{kx^2} = \frac{k^2 + 1}{4k}$.

However, we need to consider the geometric meaning of this probability. The region where a point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is actually the intersection of the four quarter-circles centered at each vertex with radius equal to half the length of the diagonal. This region is a square whose side length is $\frac{\sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2} \cdot x$, but we need to find the correct ratio.

The correct approach is to find the area of the region where the point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex, which is actually the area of the square formed by the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. The side length of this square is $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}$ for a square, but for a rectangle, it's more complex. We need to find the correct ratio of the areas.

The correct probability is actually $\frac{1}{4}$, as the region closer to the center is a square (or a smaller rectangle in the case of a rectangle) that is one-fourth of the area of the original rectangle.

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) at three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise, using the floor function for \( n \geq 4 \) and the ceiling function for \( n < 4 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to evaluate each term separately:
1. \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \): Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) is less than 4, we use the ceiling function. So, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).
2. \( f(\sqrt{45}) \): Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function. So, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).
3. \( f(8^{2/3}) \): Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is equal to 4, we use the floor function. So, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can find the sum: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 \).

\nThe problem involves calculating the total amount of money earned by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie, and then determining how much money remains after they convert as many pieces (coins) into bills as possible.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by the four individuals. We add their individual earnings:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]
Calculating the sum step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]
So, the total amount of money earned is $\$126.59$.

Next, we need to determine how many pieces (coins) can be converted into bills. Since the problem asks for the amount of money remaining after converting as many pieces into bills as possible, we need to find the remainder when the total amount is divided by 1 (dollar), but considering the cents. We can convert the total amount into cents to easily find the remainder:
\[
126.59 \text{ dollars} = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]
Since we can convert every dollar into a bill, we subtract the whole number of dollars (126) from the total amount in dollars to find the remaining cents:
\[
126.59 - 126 = 0.59
\]
So, the amount of money remaining after converting as many pieces into bills as possible is $0.59, which is 59 cents.

The problem presents a 3x3 magic square, where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. We need to find the value of \( n \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We can start by using the property of the magic square that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same. Let's denote this common sum as \( S \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can write the equation for the sum of the first row:
\[ (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = S \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2n + 1 = S \]

Next, we can write the equation for the sum of the second row:
\[ (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = S \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 3n - 6 = S \]

Since both expressions are equal to \( S \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]
Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[ 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \]
\[ 7 = n \]

So, the value of \( n \) is \( 7 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

1. Calculate the distance traveled by Jim, who walks along the diagonal of the rectangular field. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal:
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

2. Calculate the distance traveled by Martha, who walks along the perimeter of the field, covering the length and the width:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{length} + \text{width} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet} \]

3. Find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance traveled by Martha} - \text{Distance traveled by Jim} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet} \]

The problem involves finding the values of an expression involving a complex number $\omega$ such that $\omega^3 = 1$. We need to determine all possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$.

[ADVANCE]

Given that $\omega^3 = 1$, we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}$. These roots satisfy the equation $\omega^3 - 1 = 0$, which can be factored as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0$. Since $\omega \neq 1$, we have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

We can use this relationship to simplify the given expression. Let's calculate $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$.

[ADVANCE]

We can find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]
Since $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, we can substitute these values into the expression:
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
However, we need to consider if there are any other possible values for the expression. Since $\omega$ is a cube root of unity, we should also consider the case when $\omega = 1$, but in that case, the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$ is undefined because it involves division by zero.

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is 1.

The problem asks for the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once. This is a classic example of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a complete graph with 4 vertices.

We are given the distances between each pair of points:
- $AB = 6$
- $AC = 6$
- $AD = 5$
- $BC = 5$
- $BD = 3$
- $CD = 4$

We need to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex) in this graph.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the shortest distance, we can calculate the total distance for each possible Hamiltonian cycle and then compare them. There are $3! = 6$ possible Hamiltonian cycles starting from any given point, since the first point is fixed and we permute the remaining 3 points.

Let's calculate the total distance for each cycle starting from point $A$:

1. $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$: $AB + BC + CD + DA = 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20$
2. $A \to B \to D \to C \to A$: $AB + BD + DC + CA = 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19$
3. $A \to C \to B \to D \to A$: $AC + CB + BD + DA = 6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 19$
4. $A \to C \to D \to B \to A$: $AC + CD + DB + BA = 6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19$
5. $A \to D \to B \to C \to A$: $AD + DB + BC + CA = 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19$
6. $A \to D \to C \to B \to A$: $AD + DC + CB + BA = 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20$

The shortest distance among these cycles is 19.

Since the problem is symmetric, the shortest distance will be the same regardless of the starting point. Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point and visiting the other three points exactly once is $\boxed{19}$.
