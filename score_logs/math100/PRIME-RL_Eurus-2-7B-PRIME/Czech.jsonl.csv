We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse $DE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}$, we can substitute the given values into the equation. We have $\sin D = 0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}$. To find the length of $DE$, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $DE$: $DE = \frac{7}{0.7}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the value of $DE$: $DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10$.

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{10}$.

We are given two complex numbers $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$ which is the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for rotating a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta}. \]
In this case, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, so $e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Next, we need to calculate $z - c$:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i. \]

Now, we can find $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (2 - 3i) + (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} = (1 - 3i)(1+i) = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 - 2i + 3 = 4 - 2i. \]
So,
\[ w = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i. \]

The final answer is $\boxed{6 - 5i}$.

The problem requires simplifying the square root of 242. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves finding the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table, with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together.

[ADVANCE]

1. Treat the 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) who must sit together as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 people and the remaining 5 individuals) around a circular table.
2. The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange the 6 units around the circular table is $(6-1)! = 5!$.
3. Within the block of 3 people, there are $3!$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.
4. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the circular table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is $5! \times 3!$.

[ADVANCE]

1. Calculate $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.
2. Calculate $3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$.
3. Multiply the results: $120 \times 6 = 720$.

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The general term in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]
Simplifying the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]
To find the constant term, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Therefore, we set the exponent of \(x\) equal to zero and solve for \(k\):
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{3} (10)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. However, we can directly use the congruence to simplify the expression $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$.

We have:
\[ n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

So, the expression $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is congruent to $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we calculate the product:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \]

The minimum angle of rotation that will make the pentagon coincide with its original position is $\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ$.

The problem provides the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram: $(5, 3)$, $(6, 8)$, and $(7, 4)$. We need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex $(x, y)$ and then calculate $x + y$.

[ADVANCE]
In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals are the same. Let's use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex. We can consider two possible cases: either the diagonal is formed by the points $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$, or the diagonal is formed by the points $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$.

Case 1: The diagonal is formed by the points $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$.
The midpoint of the diagonal is $\left(\frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2}\right)$.
The midpoint of the other diagonal is $\left(\frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{13}{2}, 6\right)$.
Since the midpoints are the same, we can set up the equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6.
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8,
\]
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9.
\]
So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are $(8, 9)$.

Case 2: The diagonal is formed by the points $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$.
The midpoint of this diagonal is $\left(\frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{13}{2}, 6\right)$.
The midpoint of the other diagonal is $\left(\frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2}\right)$.
Since the midpoints are the same, we can set up the equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6.
\]
These equations are the same as in Case 1, so we get the same solution:
\[
x = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad y = 9.
\]
Since $x > 7$, the solution $(8, 9)$ is valid.

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \) and then calculating the sum of the asymptote values.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting the factored expression equal to zero, we get:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
This equation has solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \) depends on the degrees of the polynomials \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \). In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the sum \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

\[9801 + 99 = 9900.\]

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express the equation as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. This can be factored as $(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0$. Given that $z \neq 1$, we have $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$.

Combining like terms, the product becomes:

\[

We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can set up the following equations:

1. Coefficient of $t^3$: $3b + 20 = 26$
2. Coefficient of $t^2$: $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$
3. Coefficient of $t$: $-10 + ab = -16$
4. Constant term: $-2a = 6$

We can solve the equations step by step. First, we solve the equation from the constant term:

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute $a = -3$ into the equation from the coefficient of $t^2$:

\[
-6 + 5b + 4(-3) = -8 \implies -6 + 5b - 12 = -8 \implies 5b - 18 = -8 \implies 5b = 10 \implies b = 2
\]

We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by checking the equation from the coefficient of $t^3$:

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26

The problem involves a right circular cylindrical tank being filled with water at a rate of $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour as the tank is being filled. We need to find the radius of the tank in meters.

[ADVANCE]
The volume $V$ of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. The rate of change of the volume with respect to time is $\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}$, since the radius is constant.

We are given that $\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi$ cubic meters per hour and $\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$ meters per hour. We can substitute these values into the equation to solve for $r$.

\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

[ADVANCE]
We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by $4\pi$:

\[
r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

So, the radius of the tank is $\sqrt{5}$ meters.

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the given equation of the circle represents a circle with a radius of length 1. The equation of the circle is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \).

To find the value of \( c \), we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

[ADVANCE]
To rewrite the equation in standard form, we need to complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

First, let's complete the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, let's complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed square forms back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we have:
\[ r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \]
So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the values of \( \lambda \), we need to analyze the condition \( f(f(x)) = x \). First, we calculate \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We set this equal to \( x \):
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This equation is complex, so we will simplify it step by step.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To simplify the equation, let's denote \( y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \). Then the equation \( f(f(x)) = x \) becomes \( f(y) = x \), which means \( \lambda y(1 - y) = x \). Substituting back \( y = \lambda x(1 - x) \), we get:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
We can factor out \( x \) from both sides:
\[ x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) - 1) = 0. \]
This gives us two cases: \( x = 0 \) or \( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) - 1 = 0 \).

For the case \( x = 0 \), we have \( f(0) = 0 \), which means \( f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0 \). This satisfies \( f(f(x)) = x \), but it does not satisfy \( f(x) \neq x \) since \( f(0) = 0 \). Therefore, we discard \( x = 0 \) as a solution.

For the case \( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) - 1 = 0 \), we need to find \( x \) such that this equation holds and \( f(x) \neq x \). We can rewrite the equation as:
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = 1. \]
We need to find the values of \( \lambda \) that satisfy this equation for some \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \).

To find the values of \( \lambda \), we can analyze the quadratic function \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \). The maximum value of \( f(x) \) occurs at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), and the maximum value is \( f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4} \). Since \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function, the equation \( f(f(x)) = x \) will have solutions if the graph of \( f(f(x)) \) intersects the line \( y = x \).

We need to find the values of \( \lambda \) for which the equation \( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = 1 \) has solutions in the interval \( [0,1] \) and \( f(x) \neq x \).

By analyzing the function and the equation, we can see that the value of \( \lambda \) must be such that the function \( f(x) \) has a non-trivial solution for \( f(f(x)) = x \). We can test the boundary values of \( \lambda \) to find the correct range.

For \( \lambda = 2 \), we can verify if the equation holds. Substituting \( \lambda = 2 \) into the equation:

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 1, \]
\[ 4(1 - x - 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^2 - 2x^3) = 1, \]

\[ 4 - 12x + 16x^2 - 8x^3 = 1, \]
\[ 8x^3 - 16x^2 + 12x - 3 = 0. \]
We can check if this equation has solutions in the interval \( [0,1] \).

By solving the cubic equation \( 8x^3 - 16x^2 + 12x - 3 = 0 \), we can find the values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation. However, we can also analyze the range of \( \lambda \) by considering the fixed points of the function \( f(x) \).

The fixed points of \( f(x) \) are given by \( f(x) = x \), which means \( \lambda x(1 - x) = x \). This simplifies to:
\[ x(\lambda(1 - x) - 1) = 0. \]
So, the fixed points are \( x = 0 \) or \( \lambda(1 - x) = 1 \), which gives \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \).

For \( f(f(x)) = x \) to have a solution \( x \neq f(x) \), we need to exclude the fixed points. We can test the value \( \lambda = 2 \) and verify if it satisfies the conditions.

Calculating \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2). \]
Simplifying the expression:
\[ f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 4x - 8x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^2 + 8x^3 - 8x^4 = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4. \]
We set \( f(f(x)) = x \):
\[ 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4 = x. \]
Rearranging the equation:
\[ 8x^4 - 16x^3 + 12x^2 - 3x = 0. \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(8x^3 - 16x^2 + 12x - 3) = 0. \]
This equation has a solution \( x = 0 \), which we exclude since \( f(0) = 0 \). We need to check if the cubic equation \( 8x^3 - 16x^2 + 12x - 3 = 0 \) has solutions in the interval \( [0,1] \) other than the fixed points.

We can simplify the expression by using trigonometric identities. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).
\]
Applying this to the numerator, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we can use the sum-to-product identity for cosine:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).
\]
Applying this to the numerator, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.

Now, let's simplify the denominator. We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
The first group simplifies to:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ.
\]
The second group can be rewritten as:
\[
-2 \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the product-to-sum identity for sine:
\[
2 \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B) - \sin (A - B).
\]
Applying this, we get:
\[
-2 \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ - 50^\circ)) = -(\sin 85^\circ - \sin (-15^\circ)) = -\sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ = \sin 15^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identity for sine:
\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).
\]
Applying this to $\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ$, we get:
\[
\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ = 2 \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ + 15^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 15^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 5^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We can rewrite $\sin 85^\circ$ as $\cos 5^\circ$, so the denominator becomes:
\[
2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = \cos 5^\circ (2 \sin 20^\circ - 1).
\]
Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[

We can use the identity $\sin 35^\circ = \sin (45^\circ - 10^\circ)$ and $\sin 20^\circ = \sin (45^\circ - 25^\circ)$, but it's more efficient to look for a simpler approach. We can use known angle values and trigonometric identities to simplify the expression further.

After re-evaluating the expression, we can use the known value of $\tan 15^\circ = 2 - \sqrt{3}$ and other trigonometric identities to find the value of $\theta$.

where \(n\) is the total number of letters, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the repeated letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"", we have:

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let's set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

So, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \). We can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Therefore, the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) \) is \( \boxed{1} \).

We are given the position vectors of points $O$, $A$, and $B$ as $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$. We need to find the area of triangle $OAB$.

The area of the triangle $OAB$ can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \|
\]
where $\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}$ is the cross product of vectors $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$, and $\| \cdot \|$ denotes the magnitude of the vector.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the area of the triangle, we first need to calculate the cross product $\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}$. The cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:
\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\ u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\ u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Substituting the given vectors $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) - (3)(-2) \\ (3)(-3) - (1)(1) \\ (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ -9 - 1 \\ -2 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]
Now, we can calculate the area of the triangle $OAB$:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

We are given a complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = a \), where \( a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We recognize that \( a \) is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation \( a^2 = a + 1 \). We can use this to find \( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

Squaring the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = a \), we get:
\[
\left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 = a^2 \implies z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 \implies z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 - 2.
\]
Since \( a^2 = a + 1 \), we have:
\[
z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a + 1 - 2 = a - 1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Next, we can find \( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \) by squaring \( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \):
\[
\left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 \implies z^4 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \implies z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

We observe that \( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = -a \). Now, we can find \( z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} \):
\[
\left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 \implies z^8 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^8} = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \implies z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = a - 1.
\]

We notice that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) is periodic with a period of 6, as we can verify by calculating further terms. Specifically, we can find \( z^{16} + \frac{1}{z^{16}} \), \( z^{32} + \frac{1}{z^{32}} \), and \( z^{84} + \frac{1}{z^{84}} \) to confirm the periodicity.

Since \( 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \), we have \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

# Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.
# The line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ creates a smaller triangle $AMN$ that is similar to triangle $ABC$.
# Since $G$ is the centroid, the height of triangle $AMN$ is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the height of triangle $ABC$.
# The area of triangle $AMN$ is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$.

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ into a finite decimal number. To do this, we need to express the denominator in a form that allows us to easily convert the fraction into a decimal.

[ADVANCE]
The denominator $2^2 \cdot 5^7$ can be rewritten as $4 \cdot 5^7$. To convert this fraction into a decimal, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $2^5$ to make the denominator a power of 10. This is because $2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 2^5 = 2^7 \cdot 5^7 = (2 \cdot 5)^7 = 10^7$.

So, we multiply the fraction by $\frac{2^5}{2^5}$:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 2^5} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}.
\]

[ADVANCE]
Now, we can express the fraction $\frac{672}{10^7}$ as a decimal by moving the decimal point in 672 seven places to the left:
\[
\frac{672}{10^7} = 0.0000672.

The problem involves Paul and Jesse each randomly selecting a number from the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We need to find the probability that the sum of the numbers they select is even.

[ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers is even, we need to consider the parity (even or odd) of the numbers. The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Among these, only 2 is even, and the rest are odd.

For the sum of two numbers to be even, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd. Since there is only one even number (2) among the six prime numbers, the probability of Paul or Jesse selecting an even number is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of selecting an odd number is $\frac{5}{6}$.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that both Paul and Jesse select even numbers is:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}
\]
The probability that both Paul and Jesse select odd numbers is:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}
\]
The total probability that the sum of the numbers is even is the sum of these two probabilities:
\[
\frac{1}{36} + \frac{25}{36} = \frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}

The problem asks for the smallest positive multiple of 450, where all the digits are either 0 or 1. To solve this, we need to consider the properties of the number 450. The prime factorization of 450 is $2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2$. For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.

[ADVANCE]
1. Divisibility by 2: The number must end in 0.
2. Divisibility by 25: The number must end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00.
3. Divisibility by 9: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9. Since the only digits allowed are 0 and 1, the number of 1's in the number must be a multiple of 9.

Given these constraints, we need to find the smallest number consisting of 0's and 1's that ends in 00 and has a sum of digits that is a multiple of 9. The smallest such number is 11100, but we need to verify if it is indeed divisible by 450.

[VERIFY]
Let's check if 11100 is divisible by 450:
- Divisibility by 2: 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2.
- Divisibility by 25: 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
- Divisibility by 9: The sum of the digits of 11100 is $1+1+1+0+0 = 3$, which is not divisible by 9. Therefore, 11100 is not a valid solution.

We need to find the next smallest number consisting of 0's and 1's that ends in 00 and has a sum of digits that is a multiple of 9. The next possible number is 11111100, but we can check smaller numbers first by adding more 1's to 11100.

Let's try 11111111100, which has 9 ones and ends in 00. The sum of the digits is $1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9$, which is divisible by 9.

[ADVANCE]
Now, let's verify if 11111111100 is divisible by 450:
- Divisibility by 2: 11111111100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2.
- Divisibility by 25: 11111111100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
- Divisibility by 9: We already verified that the sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 9.

Since 11111111100 meets all the criteria, it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11111111100}$

The problem requires finding the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$.

First, we need to simplify the fraction by converting the denominator to a power of 10. The denominator is $5^7 \cdot 2^8$, and we can rewrite it as $5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2$.

So, the fraction becomes $\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 2160.5 \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 0.00021605$.

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to pair up the terms in the product. Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ).
\]
Since $\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ$, and $\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ$, the product simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ) = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}$. Now, we need to find the product of the remaining terms.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x$ to simplify the product. Let's apply this identity to the terms $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Since we need the product of the squares of these terms, we have:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Now, we can find the final product:
\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) and \(\theta\) represent the radial distance and angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, respectively, and \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height \(z\) is constant, regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This means that for any value of \(r\) and \(\theta\), the \(z\)-coordinate remains the same.

Since the height \(z\) is constant and does not depend on \(r\) or \(\theta\), the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) extends infinitely in the radial and angular directions, but remains at a fixed height \(z = c\).

The function $f(x)$ is given by $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$. The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term and $a$ is the leading coefficient.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, we can substitute $x + 5$ into the function $f(x)$ to get the expression for $g(x)$. However, we don't need to expand the expression for $g(x)$ completely. Instead, we can use the property of polynomial roots that the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is the same as the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ shifted by $-5$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is given by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $-(-49) = 49$. Since the roots of $g(x)$ are the roots of $f(x)$ shifted by $-5$, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ will be $49 - 5 = 44$.

\[

\]
This simplifies to:
\[

Now, we need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\).

\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ.

So the expression becomes:

We need to find the sum of these tangent squares. We can use the identity for the sum of squares of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression.

The problem involves finding the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$. We need to use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$ and the unknown interior angle as $x$. The sum of all interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, so we can write the equation:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - x = 1070^{\circ}.
\]
Since $x$ is an interior angle of a convex polygon, we know that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the sum of the interior angles:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x.
\]
Since $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$ must be an integer multiple of $180^{\circ}$, we can find the range of possible values for $n$ by solving the inequality:
\[
1070^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1070^{\circ} + 180^{\circ}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
1070^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ}.
\]
Dividing by $180^{\circ}$, we get:
\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}.
\]
Calculating the values, we have:
\[
5.944 < n-2 < 6.944.
\]
Since $n-2$ must be an integer, the only possible value for $n-2$ is 6. Therefore, $n = 8$.

[VERIFY]

We need to verify that the solution $n = 8$ is valid by checking if the sum of the interior angles except one can indeed be $1070^{\circ}$. For an8-sided polygon, the sum of the interior angles is:
\[
(8-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 6 \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1080^{\circ}.
\]
If we subtract one interior angle $x$ from this sum, we get:
\[
1080^{\circ} - x = 1070^{\circ},
\]
which implies:
\[
x = 1080^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} = 10^{\circ}.
\]
Since $0^{\circ} < 10^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}$, the solution is valid.

Therefore, the number of sides of the convex polygon is $\boxed{8}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We start by expressing the given condition mathematically:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find that \( 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Next, we substitute these values back into the expression for \( t \):
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer, we discard \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \) and keep \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

The unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is \( t = 17 \).

# The problem asks for the total surface area of a cube in square inches, given that the cube has a volume of 1 cubic foot.

The problem asks for the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, $\dots$.

This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term $a_1$ is 1 and the common difference $d$ is 2.

The general formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

The problem requires finding the solutions to the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\).

We need to simplify the expression inside the sine function. Recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\).

[ADVANCE]

For \(x > 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
Using the double-angle formula for sine, we get:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
For \(x < 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
Using the sine function's property \(\sin (\pi + \theta) = -\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
\sin \left( \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = -\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = -\frac{2x}{1 + x^2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
-\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Since \(x < 0\), we can multiply both sides by \(-1\) to get:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = -\frac{1}{3}.
\]
We now have two cases to solve:
1. \(\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}\) for \(x > 0\).
2. \(\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = -\frac{1}{3}\) for \(x < 0\).

[ADVANCE]

For the first case:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3} \implies 6x = 1 + x^2 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \(x > 0\), the solution is \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

For the second case:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = -\frac{1}{3} \implies 6x = -1 - x^2 \implies x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \(x < 0\), the solution is \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

[OUTPUT]

The solutions to the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

The problem involves finding the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The lines are given in vector form, and we need to use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines.

The first line is given by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
The second line is given by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Since the lines are parallel, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. We can see that the direction vector of the second line is twice the direction vector of the first line:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]

[ADVANCE]

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula:
\[d = \frac{\left|(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\right|}{\left|\mathbf{d}\right|},\]
where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

Let's choose \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we calculate the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Next, we calculate the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):
\[\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2) = \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Now, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[\left|(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\right| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.\]

We also calculate the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):
\[\left|\mathbf{d}\right| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.\]

Finally, we calculate the distance between the two lines:
\[d = \frac{\left|(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\right|}{\left|\mathbf{d}\right|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.\]

The distance between the two parallel lines is \(\boxed{7}\).

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$. The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, we can infer that $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle with $\angle ACD = 90^\circ$. Let's denote the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$ and the length of $\overline{CD}$ as $a$. Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, we can also infer that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ have the same height $h$.

The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is given by the formula:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
\]
where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$, respectively. Let's denote the length of $\overline{AD}$ as $b_1 = x$ and the length of $\overline{BC}$ as $b_2 = y$. Then we have:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + y) \times h
\]
The area of $\triangle ACD$ is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times h
\]
We also know that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ have the same height $h$, and since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is equal to the ratio of their bases:
\[
\frac{[ABC]}{[ACD]} = \frac{y}{x}
\]
Since the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$, we have:
\[
[ABCD] = [ABC] + [ACD] = \frac{y}{x} \cdot [ACD] + [ACD] = \left(\frac{y}{x} + 1\right) \cdot [ACD]
\]
Given that $[ABCD] = 42$, we can write:
\42 = \left(\frac{y}{x} + 1\right) \cdot [ACD]
\]
We also know that:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + y) \times h
\]
and
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times h
\]
Substituting $h = \frac{2 \times [ACD]}{x}$ into the equation for the area of the trapezoid, we get:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + y) \times \frac{2 \times [ACD]}{x} = \frac{(x + y) \times [ACD]}{x}
\]
Since $\frac{[ABC]}{[ACD]} = \frac{y}{x}$, we can write $[ABC] = \frac{y}{x} \cdot [ACD]$. Therefore:
\[
42 = [ABC] + [ACD] = \frac{y}{x} \cdot [ACD] + [ACD] = \left(\frac{y}{x} + 1\right) \cdot [ACD]
\]
We can also express $y$ in terms of $x$ and $[ACD]$. From the equation $42 = \frac{(x + y) \times [ACD]}{x}$, we get:
\[
42 = \left(1 + \frac{y}{x}\right) \times [ACD]
\]
Since $\frac{y}{x} = \frac{[ABC]}{[ACD]}$, we can denote $\frac{y}{x}$ as $k$, so $y = kx$. Then:
\[
42 = (1 + k) \times [ACD]
\]
We also know that:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + y) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + kx) \times \frac{2 \times [ACD]}{x} = (1 + k) \times [ACD]
\]
This confirms our previous equation. Now, we need to find the value of $k$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector and $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$, we can use the angle bisector theorem and the properties of the right triangle to find the relationship between the areas.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$, we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is equal to the ratio of their bases. Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Then the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $kx$, and we have:
\[
42 = x + kx = x(1 + k)
\]
We also know that the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is equal to the ratio of their bases, which is also equal to the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of both triangles, the ratio of the areas is simply the ratio of the bases:
\[
\frac{[ABC]}{[ACD]} = \frac{y}{x} = k
\]
We can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of the two triangles to find the value of $k$. Since the height of the trapezoid is the same as the height of the two triangles, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + y) \times h
\]
Substituting $h = \frac{2 \times [ACD]}{x}$, we get:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + y) \times \frac{2 \times [ACD]}{x} = \frac{(x + y) \times [ACD]}{x}
\]
Since $y = kx$, we have:
\[
42 = \frac{(x + kx) \times [ACD]}{x} = (1 + k) \times [ACD]
\]
We can see that $[ACD]$ is a part of the total area of the trapezoid. Since the ratio of the areas of the two triangles is $k$, we can express the area of the trapezoid as:
\[
42 = [ACD] + k \cdot [ACD] = (1 + k) \cdot [ACD]
\]
We need to find the value of $k$ to determine the area of $\triangle ACD$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector and $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$, we can use the properties of the right triangle to find the relationship between the areas.

42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + y) \times h
\]
Substituting $h = \frac{2 \times [ACD]}{x}$, we get:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \times (x + y) \times \frac{2 \times [ACD]}{x} = \frac{(x + y) \times [ACD]}{x}
\]
Since $y = kx$, we have:
\[
42 = \frac{(x + kx) \times [ACD]}{x} = (1 + k) \times [ACD]
\]
We can see that $[ACD]$ is a part of the total area of the trapezoid. Since the ratio of the areas of the two triangles is $k$, we can express the area of the trapezoid as:
\[
42 = [ACD] + k \cdot [ACD] = (1 + k) \cdot [ACD]
\]
Since the trapezoid is divided into two triangles by the angle bisector, and the height of the trapezoid is the same as the height of the two triangles, we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas of the two triangles is equal to the ratio of their bases. By the angle bisector theorem, we know that the ratio of the areas of the two triangles is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid. Therefore, we can assume that the ratio of the areas is 1:1, which means $k = 1$.

Substituting $k = 1$ into the equation, we get:
\[
42 = (1 + 1) \times [ACD] = 2 \times [ACD]
\]
Solving for $[ACD]$, we get:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

The problem is to solve for \( x \) in the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}\).

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots. This gives us:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]
Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]
Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
9 = 27x - 8x

\[
9 = 19x

Solving for \( x \), we find:
\[

We need to ensure that the solution \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) satisfies the original equation and that the expression under the square roots is non-negative. Substituting \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) into the original equation, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27-19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

This confirms that \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) is indeed a solution to the original equation.

Using the defined operation, we can substitute the values into the formula:
\[
\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

Now, we can perform the multiplication:

So the expression becomes:

We can simplify the fraction $\frac{21}{30}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we can multiply:
\[

The problem involves determining the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, intersect inside a circle. The key insight here is that the order of the points around the circle determines whether the chords intersect.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect, we can consider the convex quadrilateral formed by the four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if the points $A$ and $B$ separate the points $C$ and $D$ from each other when moving around the circle. This means that the points $C$ and $D$ must lie on opposite sides of the chord $AB$.

We can fix the points $A$ and $B$ in any positions on the circle, and then consider the relative positions of $C$ and $D$. The probability that $C$ and $D$ lie on opposite sides of the chord $AB$ is the same as the probability that the points $C$ and $D$ are in the two arcs created by the chord $AB$, which is $\frac{1}{2}$ for each point, and the combined probability is $\frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}$, but we need to consider the total number of orderings of the points.

There are $4! = 24$ possible orderings of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ around the circle. However, only half of these orderings will result in intersecting chords. This is because for any given ordering of the points, exactly half of the possible pairings of points will result in intersecting chords.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Given that there are 24 possible orderings of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ around the circle, and considering that exactly half of these orderings will result in intersecting chords, we can calculate the probability of the chords intersecting.

The number of orderings that result in intersecting chords is $\frac{24}{2} = 12$. Therefore, the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\frac{12}{24} = \frac{1}{2}$.

The problem requires finding the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, intersect inside a circle.

The problem requires us to evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\).

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we know that \(\alpha\) is in the first quadrant, so \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we know that \(\beta\) is in the first quadrant, so \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting the values we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}

Now, we need to find the product:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 Republicans and 6 Democrats) without any restrictions. Then, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats.

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Democrats:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats:

The problem requires finding a positive value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$.

To solve the equation, we can start by isolating the expression inside the cube root. We cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube root:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -4092$.

[ADVANCE]
Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula, we get:

\]

Since \(\sin (\pi + x) = -\sin x\) and \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} (-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)) (-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right))}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{16}

Since $\angle BDC = 3\alpha$, we have $\angle MDC = 2\alpha$. Now, consider triangle $BDM$. We have $\angle BMD = 90^\circ - \alpha$ and $\angle MBD = 90^\circ - 2\alpha$. Using the tangent function in triangle $BDM$, we get:
\[
\tan 2\alpha = \frac{BM}{DM}
\]
Since $DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1$, we have:
\[
\tan 2\alpha = BM
\]
We also know that $\tan \alpha = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11}$. Using the double-angle identity for tangent, $\tan 2\alpha = \frac{2\tan \alpha}{1 - \tan^2 \alpha}$, we can substitute $\tan \alpha = \frac{BM}{11}$ into the equation:
\[
BM = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{BM}{11}}{1 - \left(\frac{BM}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{2BM}{11}}{1 - \frac{BM^2}{121}} = \frac{2BM \cdot 121}{121 - BM^2}
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
BM \left(121 - BM^2\right) = 2BM \cdot 11
\]
Assuming $BM \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $BM$:
\[
121 - BM^2 = 22
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
BM^2 = 99 \implies BM = \sqrt{99} = 3\sqrt{11}
\]
Now, we can find $BC$. Since $BM = MC$ (because $AB = AC$), we have:
\[
BC = 2BM = 2 \cdot 3\sqrt{11} = 6\sqrt{11}
\]
Next, we need to find $AB$. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $ABM$, we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + (3\sqrt{11})^2 = 121 + 99 = 220
\]
So,
\[
AB = \sqrt{220} = 2\sqrt{55}
\]
Since $AB = AC$, we have $AC = 2\sqrt{55}$. The perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2\sqrt{55} + 2\sqrt{55} + 6\sqrt{11} = 4\sqrt{55} + 6\sqrt{11}
\]
We can simplify this expression further by factoring out $\sqrt{11}$:
\[
4\sqrt{55} + 6\sqrt{11} = 4\sqrt{5 \cdot 11} + 6\sqrt{11} = 4\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{11} + 6\sqrt{11} = (4\sqrt{5} + 6)\sqrt{11}
\]
However, we should check if this can be simplified to a numerical value. Let's calculate the numerical value of the perimeter.

The problem involves finding the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is $3^7$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first of the 27 consecutive integers as $x$. Then the integers are $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26$.

The sum of these integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) \]
where $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. In this case, $n = 27$, $a = x$, and $d = 1$. So the sum is:
\[ S = \frac{27}{2} (2x + 26) = 27(x + 13) \]
We are given that the sum is $3^7 = 2187$, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 27(x + 13) = 2187 \]
Solving for $x$:
\[ x + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81 \]
\[ x = 81 - 13 = 68 \]
The 27 consecutive integers are $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$.

[ADVANCE]

Since there are 27 consecutive integers (an odd number), the median is the middle number, which is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:
\[ x + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81 \]
So, the median of the 27 consecutive integers is $\boxed{81}$.

The problem requires finding the real values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We need to break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factorize the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where the expression $(y + 7)(y - 3)$ is negative. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$ and $x^2 \geq 0$, we only consider the interval $0 \leq y < 3$. Substituting back $y = x^2$, we get $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which implies $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factorized as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ and it is equal to 0 only when $x^2 = -2$ (which has no real solutions), the inequality $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ is satisfied for all real $x$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. The solution to the first inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, and the solution to the second inequality is all real numbers. Therefore, the intersection of these solutions is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

\end{align*}
We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
We also need to use the third given equation to find a relation involving $s$ and $p$. The equation $xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12$ can be factored as
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
This can be rewritten as
\[xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $p$ for $xy + yz + zx$ and $q = 4$ for $xyz$, we get
\[sp - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\]
\[sp = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to
\[s^3 = 64,\]
which gives us
\[s = 4.\]
Now, substituting $s = 4$ back into the equation $sp = 24$, we get
\[4p = 24,\]
which simplifies to
\[p = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $\boxed{6}$.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which can be written as \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator \(x(x-36)\) and the points where the expression inside the absolute value is zero, i.e., \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

However, we must note that the expression is undefined when the denominator is zero, so \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 36\).

[ADVANCE]

To solve the inequality, we need to consider the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into the following intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied.

[ADVANCE]

In the interval \((-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{(-10)(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

In the interval \((-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{(-1)(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

In the interval \((0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{(1)(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

In the interval \((9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 18\):
\[
\frac{|(18-9)(18+9)|}{(18)(18-36)} = \frac{|(9)(27)|}{(18)(-18)} = \frac{243}{-324} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

In the interval \((36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
\[
\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{(40)(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{(40)(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

[ADVANCE]

From the above tests, we see that the inequality is satisfied in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the inequality is strict (i.e., less than 0), the endpoints are not included.

The problem involves finding the maximum possible area of a rectangular field enclosed in a running track. The track consists of two straight sections and two semicircular sections, with a total length of 400 meters. We need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize its area.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by $L$ and the width by $W$. The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sections and the circumferences of the two semicircular sections. Since the two semicircular sections together form a full circle, the total length of the track can be expressed as:
\[ 2L + 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = 400 \]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]
We can express $L$ in terms of $W$:
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \]
The area $A$ of the rectangle is given by:
\[ A = L \times W = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right)W = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $W$, set it to zero, and solve for $W$:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
Solving for $W$, we get:
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]
Now, we can find the corresponding value of $L$:
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right) = 200 - 100 = 100 \]
The maximum area $A$ is:
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]
Therefore, the maximum possible area of the pole is $\boxed{\frac{20000}{\pi}}$ square meters.

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ and $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows: $RS = a$, $ST = b$, and $RT = c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse.

Given $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$, we can write:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{b}{c} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This implies that $b = 2k$ and $c = 5k$ for some positive constant $k$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the side $RS$:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \implies a^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2 \implies a^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2 \implies a^2 = 21k^2 \implies a = \sqrt{21}k
\]

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, $\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{a}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{21}k}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The distance $D$ from the origin to a point $(x, y)$ on the graph is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's denote this expression as $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
This gives us the critical points $x = 0$ and $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$. We need to evaluate $f(x)$ at these points to find the minimum value.
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, so the minimum distance $D$ is:
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The minimum distance can be expressed as $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

The minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. Therefore, the values of $a$ and $b$ are 10 and 2, respectively, and the sum $a+b$ is $\boxed{12}$.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 0 \), which gives \( x = 3 \). Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \). Factoring out \( x \), we get \( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \). Since \( x \neq 0 \) (because \( x > 3 \)), we solve \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). The discriminant of this quadratic equation is \( 2^2 - 4(-1)(3) = 4 + 12 = 16 \), which is positive, so there are real solutions. However, we need to check if the solutions are greater than 3. The solutions are given by \( x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2} \), which gives \( x = -1 \) or \( x = 3 \). Since neither of these solutions is greater than 3, there is no valid solution for \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, to find \( f^{-1}(6) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \) for both pieces of the function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 6 \), which gives \( x = -3 \). Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \), which gives \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \). We can try to find the roots of this equation. By inspection, \( x = 2 \) is not a root, but \( x = 3 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). We can use numerical methods or further analysis to find the root, but for simplicity, let's assume we found that \( x = 2 \) is not the root we are looking for in the domain \( x > 3 \), however, \( x = 2 \) is not greater than 3, we need to check other values or use numerical methods, however, we have \( x = 2 \) as a root for the whole function and we need to check which domain it is in. 

However, we have \( x = 2 \) as a root for the whole function and it is not in the domain \( x > 3 \), we need to check other values or use numerical methods, but we can use the derivative to check the behavior of the function.

We can use the derivative to check the behavior of the function for \( x > 3 \).

The derivative of \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \) is \( -3x^2 + 4x + 3 \). We can check the value of the derivative at \( x = 3 \) to see the behavior of the function.

\[ -3(3)^2 + 4(3) + 3 = -27 + 12 + 3 = -12 \]

Since the derivative is negative at \( x = 3 \) and the function is decreasing for \( x > 3 \), we can conclude that the function \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \) does not equal 6 for \( x > 3 \) since we already checked the roots.

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we can calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):

\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 4 other vertices. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as $A, B, C, D, E, F$ and the point as $P$. The given distances are $PA = 3$, $PB = 7$, $PC = 8$, $PD = 9$, and $PE = 11$. We need to find the distance $PF$.

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. This is a known property of regular octahedra.

Let's denote the distance $PF$ as $x$. According to the property, we have:
\[PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = \text{constant}\]

Since the octahedron is regular, the constant is the same for any point $P$. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices is the same for all vertices.

We can calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324\]

Let's denote the distance $PF$ as $x$. Then, we have:
\[PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 324 + x^2\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices is the same for all vertices. For a regular octahedron, this constant sum is equal to $4R^2$, where $R$ is the circumradius of the octahedron.

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to $4R^2$, where $R$ is the circumradius of the octahedron. Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is the same.

We can assume that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from point $P$ to the vertices. Therefore, we have:
\[324 + x^2 = 4R^2\]

However, we don't need to find the value of $R$. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. We can find the value of $x$ by using the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is the same.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices is the same for all vertices. Therefore, we have:

The problem involves comparing the acceleration of a softball thrown by Jen to a baseball thrown by Jack, given that the force applied by Jen is the same as the force applied by Jack. We need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), or F = ma.

[ADVANCE]
Let's denote the mass of the baseball as \( m_b = 150 \) g and the mass of the softball as \( m_s = 200 \) g. Let the acceleration of the baseball be \( a_b \) and the acceleration of the softball be \( a_s \). Since the force applied by Jack and Jen is the same, we can set up the equation:
\[ F = m_b a_b = m_s a_s \]
This implies:
\[ 150 a_b = 200 a_s \]
We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, which is \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \).

[ADVANCE]
Rearranging the equation to solve for \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \):
\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]
So, the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

We need to find the number of identical digits in the representations of the number $629_{10}$ in base 7 and base 8.

First, we need to convert the decimal number 629 to its representations in base 7 and base 8.

Next, we will compare the digits of the two representations to find the number of identical digits.

[ADVANCE]

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 7, we perform the following divisions:
\[ 629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
\[ 89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
So, the representation of $629_{10}$ in base 7 is $1556_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 8, we perform the following divisions:
\[ 629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
\[ 9 \div 8 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
So, the representation of $629_{10}$ in base 8 is $1165_8$.

Now, we compare the digits of the two representations: $1556_7$ and $1165_8$.

We see that the digits in the same positions are:
- The first digit (from the left) is 1 in both representations.
- The fourth digit (from the right) is 5 in both representations.

Therefore, there are 2 identical digits in the representations of the number $629_{10}$ in base 7 and base 8.

The problem involves determining the number of handshakes that occur between a group of six charmed women (charodějnice) and a group of ten charmed men (charodějící) at a magical evening.

[ADVANCE]

Each of the six charodějnic will shake hands with each of the ten charodějící, but there will be no handshakes between the charodějnic or between the charodějící.

To find the total number of handshakes, we can calculate the number of handshakes between the charodějnic and the charodějící. This can be done by multiplying the number of charodějnic by the number of charodějící.

The calculation is:
\[ 6 \text{ (charodějnic)} \times 10 \text{ (charodějící)} = 60 \]

So, the total number of handshakes that occurred at the evening is 60.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem is to find the number of handshakes between six charodějnic and ten charodějící. Since each charodějnic shakes hands with each charodějící, but there are no handshakes between charodějnic or charodějící, the total number of handshakes is the product of the number of charodějnic and the number of charodějící.

We are given a polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \) and we need to find the polynomial \( g(x) \) which is equal to \( f(x-1) \). Then, we have to find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \).

[ADVANCE]

To find \( g(x) \), we need to substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \). So, we have:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

We can expand each term separately:
\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1, \]
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]

Now, substitute these expansions back into the expression for \( g(x) \):
\[ g(x) = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) + 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 9(x - 1) - 2. \]

Distribute the coefficients:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2). \]
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is found by substituting \( x = 1 \) into the polynomial. So, we substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( g(x) \):
\[ g(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15. \]
\[ g(1) = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15. \]
\[ g(1) = 3 + 23 + 15 - 12 - 31. \]
\[ g(1) = 41 - 43. \]

The problem requires finding the shortest distance from the point $(6, 0)$ to the line $y = 2x - 2$. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(6, 0)$, so $x_1 = 6$ and $y_1 = 0$. Now we can substitute these values into the distance formula.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
Substituting the values into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:
\[

We need to find the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. Let's denote these expressions as $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively. Then, we have:
\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.

\]

Since $a + b + c = 0$, we can consider the polynomial whose roots are $a$, $b$, and $c$:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = t^3 + (ab+bc+ca)t - 4.
\]

We need to find the value of $ab + bc + ca$. We can use the fact that:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + 4\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4.
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0^2 - 2(0)(-2) + 4(-2) = -8.
\]

Since $a + b + c = 0$, we have:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab+bc+ca) = -2(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Thus,
\[
-2(ab+bc+ca) = -8 \implies ab+bc+ca = 4.
\]

The polynomial whose roots are $a$, $b$, and $c$ is:
\[
t^3 + 4t - 4 = 0.

We can solve this polynomial to find the roots. By inspection, we see that $t = 1$ is a root:
\[

To find the decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$, we can perform the division. However, it's often easier to convert the fraction to a decimal by making the denominator a power of 10. We can do this by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 2 to make the denominator 1000.

The points closer to the center than to any vertex will lie within the region bounded by these perpendicular bisectors.

The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will form a smaller rectangle with its sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle $ABCD$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the segments joining the center to the vertices.

Let's assume the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle $ABCD$ are $A(-a, b)$, $B(a, b)$, $C(a, -b)$, and $D(-a, -b)$, and the center is $O(0, 0)$. The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will intersect at the points $(\pm \frac{a}{2}, \pm \frac{b}{2})$.

The area of the smaller rectangle (the region closer to the center) is $\left(\frac{a}{2} - \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right) \left(\frac{b}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right) = ab$.

The area of the original rectangle $ABCD$ is $2a \cdot 2b = 4ab$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is $\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}$.

The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

We need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) for three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

We will evaluate each term separately.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) is less than 4, we use \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is equal to 4, we use \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we need to sum these values: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 \).

\nThe problem involves calculating the total amount of money earned by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie from selling scouter cookies, and then determining how much of that total amount can be exchanged for dollars when cashing in the coins at the bank.

\nThe amounts earned by each person are:
\nLinda: $\$27.47$
\nSherry: $\$35.23$
\nJune: $\$37.37$
\nConnie: $\$26.52$

\nThe objective is to find the total amount of money they have, and then determine how much of that total can be exchanged for dollars when cashing in the coins, which will be the amount of money left in cents.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
[ADVANCE]
\nFirst, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by all four individuals. We do this by adding their individual earnings:
\n\[
\$27.47 + \$35.23 + \$37.37 + \$26.52
\]
\nConverting each amount to cents (since $1 dollar = 100 cents$), we get:
\n\[
2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652
\]
\nNow, we perform the addition:
\n\[
2747 + 3523 = 6270
\]
\n\[
6270 + 3737 = 10007
\]
\n\[
10007 + 2652 = 12659
\]
\nSo, the total amount of money earned is $12659$ cents.

\nNext, we need to determine how much of this total amount can be exchanged for dollars when cashing in the coins at the bank. Since banknotes are typically given in dollars and cents, we need to find the remainder when the total amount in cents is divided by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

\nTo find out how much money will be left after exchanging the maximum amount for dollars, we need to find the remainder when 12659 is divided by 100:
\n\[
12659 \div 100 = 126 \text{ dollars and } 59 \text{ cents}
\]
\nThe remainder is 59 cents, which is the amount of money that will be left after exchanging the maximum amount for dollars.

We are given that $\omega$ is a complex number such that $\omega^3 = 1.$ We need to find all possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.$

[ADVANCE]

Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2,$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i.$ Note that $\omega^3 - 1 = 0$ can be factored as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.$ Since $\omega \neq 1,$ we have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$

We can use this relationship to simplify the given expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]
Since $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0,$ we can rewrite $\omega^2$ as $-1 - \omega.$ Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]
To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.
\]
We can simplify further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\omega^2$ (since $\omega^3 = 1$):
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{\omega^2}{\omega^3(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{\omega^2}{1 + \omega}.
\]
Now, we can use the fact that $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$ to substitute for $\omega^2$:
\[
-\frac{\omega^2}{1 + \omega} = -\frac{-1 - \omega}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega} = 1.

Thus, the expression simplifies to $1.$
