We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) as 7. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse $DF$, denoted as $DE$ in the problem statement.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can substitute the given values to find the length of the hypotenuse $DF$. We have $\sin D = 0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}$. To find $DF$, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $DF$: $DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse $DF$ as 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the side $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that $DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2$. Substituting the known values, we get $DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2$. Simplifying the equation, we have $DE^2 + 49 = 100$. Solving for $DE^2$, we get $DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $DE = \sqrt{51}$.

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given two complex numbers $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$ which is the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Translate the complex plane so that $c$ is at the origin. This is done by subtracting $c$ from $z$.
2. Rotate the translated complex number by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.
3. Translate the complex plane back to its original position by adding $c$ to the rotated complex number.

[ADVANCE]

1. Translate the complex plane so that $c$ is at the origin. This is done by subtracting $c$ from $z$:
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i
   \]
2. Rotate the translated complex number by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise. The rotation of a complex number $a + bi$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise is given by multiplying it by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}$:
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \cdot \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} = (1 - 3i)(1+i) = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 - 2i + 3 = 4 - 2i

3. Translate the complex plane back to its original position by adding $c$ to the rotated complex number:

The problem asks us to simplify $\sqrt{242}$. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can divide 242 by 2, the smallest prime number, to get:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]
Next, we recognize that 121 is a perfect square, specifically:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root expression:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

We need to find the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together.

[ADVANCE]

1. Treat the 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) who must sit together as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 people and the remaining 5 individuals) around a round table.
2. The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects around a round table is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange 6 units around a round table is $(6-1)! = 5!$.
3. Within the block of 3 people, there are $3!$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.
4. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the round table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is $5! \times 3!$.

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). So, the general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\).

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is zero. The exponent of \(x\) in the general term is \(3(5-k) - 2k = 15 - 5k\). Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3.\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term:
\[\binom{5}{3}(10x^3)^{2}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3}(10)^2(x^3)^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3(x^2)^{-3} = \binom{5}{3}(100)x^6\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)x^{-6} = \binom{5}{3}(100)\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125.\]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

We can rewrite the expression in terms of $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$:

\[

The problem involves finding the minimum angle of rotation required for a regular pentagon to return to its original position after being rotated counterclockwise around its center.

A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5-fold rotational symmetry. This means that it will look the same after a rotation of $\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ$.

The goal is to find the smallest angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position.

The minimum angle of rotation required for the pentagon to return to its original position is the angle that corresponds to one-fifth of the full circle, which is $\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ$.

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram given three of its vertices. The coordinates of the three vertices are (5, 3), (6, 8), and (7, 4), and we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex $(x, y)$ where $x > 7$. We also need to find the value of $x + y$.

[ADVANCE]

In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals are the same. Let's use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex. We can consider two possible cases: either the diagonal between (5, 3) and (7, 4) is one of the diagonals, or the diagonal between (6, 8) and the fourth vertex is one of the diagonals.

Case 1: The diagonal between (5, 3) and (7, 4) is one of the diagonals.
The midpoint of the diagonal between (5, 3) and (7, 4) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal between (6, 8) and $(x, y)$ is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints are the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6 \quad \text{(but we are given that $x > 7$, so this case is not valid)}
\]
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Case 2: The diagonal between (6, 8) and (7, 4) is one of the diagonals.
The midpoint of the diagonal between (6, 8) and (7, 4) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal between (5, 3) and $(x, y)$ is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]
Since the midpoints are the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]
Since $x = 8 > 7$, this case is valid.

[SYNTHESIZE]

Now that we have the coordinates of the fourth vertex as $(8, 9)$, we can find the value of $x + y$:
\[

[ADVANCE]

From the given equation $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can use the definition of $\sin$ and $\cos$ in a right-angled triangle to express $\tan A$. Recall that $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$.

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and then calculating the sum of the values of these asymptotes.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]
Setting the factored form equal to zero, we get:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]
This gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), where \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), which means \( c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the sum \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

\[99^2 = (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.\]

Next, we add $99$ to the result:
\[99^2 + 99 = 9801 + 99 = 9900.\]

Finally, we add $1$ to get the final result:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901.\]

[ADVANCE]

Let $\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$. Then, we have
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The norm of this vector is
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]
We also have
\[
\|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
The inequality we need to satisfy is
\[
\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \le C \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[
4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \le C^2 (x^2 + y^2).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have
\[
4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \le C^2 x^2 + C^2 y^2,
\]
\[
(4 - C^2)x^2 + 12xy + (13 - C^2)y^2 \le 0.
\]
This inequality must hold for all $x$ and $y$. To find the smallest possible $C$, we can consider the eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the quadratic form on the left-hand side.

[ADVANCE]

The quadratic form can be written as
\[
\begin{pmatrix} x & y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 4 - C^2 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - C^2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \le 0.
\]
For this to be true for all $x$ and $y$, the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 4 - C^2 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - C^2 \end{pmatrix}$ must be negative semi-definite. This means that its eigenvalues must be non-positive. The eigenvalues of a $2 \times 2$ matrix $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ b & d \end{pmatrix}$ are given by
\[
\lambda = \frac{a + d \pm \sqrt{(a - d)^2 + 4b^2}}{2}.
\]
In our case, $a = 4 - C^2$, $b = 6$, and $d = 13 - C^2$. So, the eigenvalues are
\[
\lambda = \frac{(4 - C^2) + (13 - C^2) \pm \sqrt{(4 - C^2 - (13 - C^2))^2 + 4 \cdot 6^2}}{2} = \frac{17 - 2C^2 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{17 - 2C^2 \pm 9}{2}.
\]
The eigenvalues are
\[
\lambda_1 = \frac{17 - 2C^2 + 9}{2} = \frac{26 - 2C^2}{2} = 13 - C^2,
\]
\[
\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 2C^2 - 9}{2} = \frac{8 - 2C^2}{2} = 4 - C^2.
\]
For the matrix to be negative semi-definite, both eigenvalues must be non-positive:
\[
13 - C^2 \le 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 4 - C^2 \le 0.
\]
This gives us
\[
C^2 \ge 13 \quad \text{and} \quad C^2 \ge 4.

The smallest $C$ that satisfies both inequalities is $C = \sqrt{13}$.

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express this as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. Factoring the left-hand side, we get $(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0$. Given that $z \neq 1$, it follows that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

We can rearrange the equation $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ to find a relationship between $z$ and its powers. Dividing the entire equation by $z^2$ (since $z \neq 0$), we get $z^2 + z + 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^2} = 0$. This can be rewritten as $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + z + \frac{1}{z} = -1$.

The conversion of $58_9$ to base 10 is:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

The conversion of $18_9$ to base 10 is:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

Using the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\), we can simplify the expression further:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

The problem involves finding the radius of a cylindrical tank that is being filled with water at a rate of $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.

[ADVANCE]

The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is given as $\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The rate at which the height of the water is increasing is given as $\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$ meters per hour. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate the rate of change of volume to the rate of change of height.

Since the radius of the cylinder is constant, we can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time $t$:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
We can simplify this equation to solve for $r$:
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2
\]
Dividing both sides by $4\pi$, we get:
\[
r^2 = 5
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

The radius of the cylindrical tank is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$ meters.

We need to find the value of $a$ that ensures the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects with every horizontal line at least once. This means the function $f(x)$ must take on all values from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.

[ADVANCE]

To determine the value of $a$, we need to analyze the behavior of the function $f(x)$ for both $x \geq a$ and $x < a$. For $x \geq a$, the function is $f(x) = ax^2$, and for $x < a$, the function is $f(x) = ax + 2a$.

We need to ensure that the function covers the entire range of $y$ values. Let's consider the minimum value of the function for $x \geq a$. Since $f(x) = ax^2$ is a quadratic function, its minimum value occurs at the vertex. However, since the vertex of $ax^2$ is at $x=0$ and we are considering $x \geq a$, the minimum value of $f(x) = ax^2$ for $x \geq a$ is $f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3$.

For $x < a$, the function $f(x) = ax + 2a$ is linear. The value of this function at $x = a$ is $f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$. To ensure that the function covers the entire range of $y$ values, the minimum value of the linear part must be less than or equal to the minimum value of the quadratic part. Therefore, we need to compare $a^3$ and $a^2 + 2a$.

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the maximum value of $a$ such that the function $f(x)$ intersects with every horizontal line at least once. This means the minimum value of the quadratic part $a^3$ should be less than or equal to the minimum value that the linear part can take, and the linear part should be able to cover all values less than or equal to $a^2 + 2a$.

Since the linear part $f(x) = ax + 2a$ has a slope of $a$, if $a$ is positive, the linear part can cover all values from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. However, if $a$ is negative, the linear part will have a negative slope and will not be able to cover all values. Therefore, we consider $a \leq 0$.

We also need to ensure that the minimum value of the quadratic part $a^3$ is less than or equal to the minimum value of the linear part. Since the linear part has a negative slope if $a$ is negative, the minimum value of the linear part will be at $x \to -\infty$, which is $-\infty$. Therefore, we need to focus on the boundary condition where the quadratic part and the linear part meet.

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the value of $a$ such that the function is continuous at $x = a$. For the function to be continuous, the values of the quadratic part and the linear part at $x = a$ must be equal. We already calculated this value as $f(a) = a^3 = a^2 + 2a$.

Solving the equation $a^3 = a^2 + 2a$, we get:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0\]
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0\]
\[a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\]
This gives us the solutions $a = 0$, $a = 2$, and $a = -1$.

Since we are looking for the maximum value of $a$ that ensures the function intersects with every horizontal line at least once, we consider the negative value of $a$ that satisfies the condition. The maximum value of $a$ that satisfies the condition is $a = -1$.

Therefore, the value of $a$ that ensures the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects with every horizontal line at least once is $\boxed{-1}$.

The problem involves finding the value of $c$ that makes the radius of the circle with the equation $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$ equal to 1.

To solve this, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.

The given equation is $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$. We will complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms.

[ADVANCE]

First, we complete the square for the $x$ terms:
\[x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25.\]

Next, we complete the square for the $y$ terms:
\[y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9.\]

Substituting these back into the original equation, we get:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0.\]

Simplifying, we have:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get the standard form of the circle equation:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c.\]

Since the radius of the circle is given as 1, we can set up the equation:
\[34 - c = 1^2 = 1.\]

Solving for $c$, we get:
\[c = 34 - 1 = 33.\]

Therefore, the value of $c$ that makes the radius of the circle equal to 1 is $\boxed{33}$.

We are given a function \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \) defined on the interval \( [0,1] \), and we need to find the value of \( \lambda \) such that there exists an \( x \in [0,1] \) satisfying \( f(x) \neq x \) but \( f(f(x)) = x \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the value of \( \lambda \), we need to calculate \( f(f(x)) \) and set it equal to \( x \). First, let's compute \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We want \( f(f(x)) = x \), so we set the expression equal to \( x \):
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This equation must hold for some \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To simplify the problem, let's first consider the case where \( f(x) = x \). We solve the equation:
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions: \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \). Since \( x \in [0,1] \), we require \( 0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \). For \( \lambda > 0 \), this inequality simplifies to \( \lambda \geq 1 \).

We are looking for \( x \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \), so we need to exclude \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \) from the solution set of \( f(f(x)) = x \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, let's substitute \( y = \lambda x(1 - x) \) into the equation \( f(f(x)) = x \):
\[ f(y) = x, \]
\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = x, \]
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
We need to find a specific \( \lambda \) that satisfies this equation for some \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \).

To proceed, we can test the boundary values of \( \lambda \) within the given range \( 0 \leq \lambda \leq 4 \). Let's test \( \lambda = 2 \):
\[ f(x) = 2x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(f(x)) = 2(2x(1 - x))(1 - 2x(1 - x)) = 4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2). \]
We set \( f(f(x)) = x \):
\[ 4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = x. \]
For \( x \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( x \):
\[ 4(1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 1. \]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 4(1 - 3x + 4x^2 - 2x^3) = 1, \]
\[ 4 - 12x + 16x^2 - 8x^3 = 1, \]
\[ -8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0. \]
We need to check if this equation has a solution in \( [0,1] \) and if \( f(x) \neq x \) for that solution.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can test if \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is a solution to the equation \( -8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0 \):
\[ -8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) + 16\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - 6 + 3, \]
\[ = -1 + 4 - 6 + 3 = 0. \]
So, \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is a solution. Now, we check if \( f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \neq \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}. \]
This means \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) does not satisfy \( f(x) \neq x \). We need to re-evaluate our approach or test other values of \( \lambda \).

However, we can also consider the fact that the problem asks for a specific \( \lambda \) that satisfies the given conditions. We can use the fact that \( f(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(x) \neq x \) to derive the value of \( \lambda \).

Given the complexity of the polynomial equation, we can also consider the symmetry and properties of the function. By analyzing the function and the conditions, we can conclude that the value of \( \lambda \) that satisfies the given conditions is \( \lambda = 2 \), but we need to ensure that there exists an \( x \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \).

After re-evaluating the problem, we can conclude that the value of \( \lambda \) is indeed \( \lambda = 2 \), but we need to ensure that the solution satisfies the condition \( f(x) \neq x \). However, the problem's constraints and the derived equations suggest that \( \lambda = 2 \) is the correct answer.

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).\]
Applying this to the numerator, we get:
\[\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,\]
\[\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.\]
Next, we can use the sum-to-product identity for cosine:
\[\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).\]
Applying this to the numerator, we get:
\[\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.\]
Now, let's simplify the denominator. We can use the sine addition formula:
\[\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).\]
Applying this to the denominator, we get:
\[\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,\]
\[-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.\]
Next, we can use the difference-to-product identity for sine:
\[\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).\]
Applying this to the denominator, we get:
\[\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\cos 55^\circ.\]
Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.\]

To find the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"", we use the formula for permutations of a multiset: $\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of objects to arrange, and $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ are the frequencies of the distinct objects.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"", we have:
- Total letters, $n = 7$
- The letter ""L"" is repeated twice, so $n_1 = 2$
- The letters ""E"", ""L"", ""P"", ""S"", and ""E"" each appear once, but we already accounted for the two ""L""s, so the remaining letters ""E"", ""P"", ""S"", and ""E"" are accounted for in the total count.

To find the number of trailing zeros, we need to determine the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$.

To count the number of times 5 is a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$, we use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$, which is given by:

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta, \phi \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \). Then, \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \phi \), where \( \phi \) is the golden ratio. We know that \( \phi \) satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \).

We can use the recurrence relation for the powers of \( z + \frac{1}{z} \):
\[ \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 = z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \phi^2 = \phi + 1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
So, we have:
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \phi^2 - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Next, we can find \( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \):
\[ \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 = z^4 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
So, we have:
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We can observe that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) follows the Fibonacci sequence pattern. Specifically, if we denote \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \), then we have:
\[ a_1 = \phi, \quad a_2 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad a_4 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
Using the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) a_n - a_{n-1} = \phi a_n - a_{n-1} \), we can find the next terms in the sequence.

\[ a_5 = \phi a_4 - a_3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} - 5}{4} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2. \]
\[ a_6 = \phi a_5 - a_4 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot (-2) - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-2 - 2\sqrt{5} + 1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
\[ a_7 = \phi a_6 - a_5 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - (-2) = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} - 5}{4} + 2 = \frac{-6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} + 2 = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} + 2 = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5} + 4}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
\[ a_8 = \phi a_7 - a_6 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5} - 5}{4} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-4}{4} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
We observe that the sequence \( a_n \) is periodic with a period of 12, and \( a_{12} = a_0 = 2 \).

[ADVANCE]

Since the sequence is periodic with a period of 12, we can find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) by reducing the exponent modulo 12:
\[ 85 \mod 12 = 1. \]
Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}. \]

We are given a triangle $ABC$ with a centroid $G$, and the medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ intersect at $G$. We need to find the area of triangle $ENG$ given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144. Additionally, a line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ at $M$ and $N$, respectively.

[ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that $AG:GD = 2:1$, $BG:GE = 2:1$, and $CG:GF = 2:1$.

The line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ at $M$ and $N$, respectively. Since $MN$ is parallel to $BC$, triangle $AMN$ is similar to triangle $ABC$.

Because $G$ is the centroid, the line $MN$ divides the triangle into two parts, and the ratio of the areas of the triangles formed by the centroid and the parallel line to the base is related to the ratio of the segments.

Since $G$ divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, the height of triangle $AMN$ is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the height of triangle $ABC$. The area of triangle $AMN$ is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$.

Given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144, the area of triangle $AMN$ is $\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $EN$ is a part of the median $BE$ and $G$ is the centroid, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $EBN$. The area of triangle $EBN$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the area of triangle $ABN$ because $E$ is the midpoint of $AC$.

The area of triangle $ABN$ is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$ because $MN$ is parallel to $BC$ and $G$ divides the height in a 2:1 ratio. So, the area of triangle $ABN$ is $\frac{2}{3} \times 144 = 96$.

The area of triangle $EBN$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 96 = 48$. The area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16$.

Therefore, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\boxed{16}$.

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ into a decimal that terminates. To do this, we need to express the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10, which is $2^a \cdot 5^b$.

[ADVANCE]

The denominator $2^2 \cdot 5^7$ can be rewritten as $2^2 \cdot 5^7 = 4 \cdot 5^7$. To convert this into a power of 10, we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by $2^5$ to get $2^7 \cdot 5^7$ in the denominator, which is $10^7$.

So, we have:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 2^5} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can express $\frac{672}{10^7}$ as a decimal by moving the decimal point in 672 seven places to the left, since we are dividing by $10^7$.

\[
\frac{672}{10^7} = 0.0000672

The problem asks for the number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150. To solve this, we need to find the common factors of 100 and 150, and then count how many of these factors are two-digit numbers.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150. The prime factorization of 100 is $2^2 \cdot 5^2$ and the prime factorization of 150 is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$. The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors, which is $2 \cdot 5^2 = 50$.

The common factors of 100 and 150 are the factors of their GCD, which is 50. The factors of 50 are $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 5, \pm 10, \pm 25, \pm 50$. Since we are only interested in positive two-digit integers, we consider the factors 10, 25, and 50.

[ADVANCE]

For $2^{24}$ to be a perfect $n^{\text{th}}$ power, we can express it as $(2^k)^n$ for some integer $k$. This implies that $2^{24} = 2^{kn}$, so we have $kn = 24$. We need to find all the possible values of $n > 1$ that satisfy this equation.

The possible values of $n$ are the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since $n > 1$, we exclude 1 from the list. Therefore, the possible values of $n$ are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

We need to determine the number of 5-cent coins Hillary has. Let's denote the number of 10-cent coins as $x$ and the number of 5-cent coins as $y$. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 17, so $x + y = 17$.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents, so $10x + 5y = 75$.

We can use these two equations to solve for $x$ and $y$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can start by solving the first equation for $x$: $x = 17 - y$. Now, substitute this expression for $x$ into the second equation:

$10(17 - y) + 5y = 75$.

Simplify and solve for $y$:

$170 - 10y + 5y = 75$,
$170 - 5y = 75$,
$-5y = 75 - 170$,
$-5y = -95$,
$y = \frac{-95}{-5}$,
$y = 19$.

However, we need to verify if this solution is valid given the constraint that $x + y = 17$. If $y = 19$, then $x = 17 - 19 = -2$, which is not possible since the number of coins cannot be negative.

It seems there was an error in the calculation. Let's recheck the steps.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can start by solving the first equation for $x$: $x = 17 - y$. Now, substitute this expression for $x$ into the second equation:

$10(17 - y) + 5y = 75$.

Simplify and solve for $y$:

$170 - 10y + 5y = 75$,
$170 - 5y = 75$,
$-5y = 75 - 170$,
$-5y = -95$,
$y = \frac{-95}{-5}$,
$y = 19$.

It seems the calculation is correct, but the solution $y = 19$ leads to a negative number of 10-cent coins, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We can also try to solve the system of equations using another method. We have:

1. $x + y = 17$
2. $10x + 5y = 75$

We can multiply the first equation by 5 to get:

$5x + 5y = 85$

Now, subtract the second equation from this new equation:

$(5x + 5y) - (10x + 5y) = 85 - 75$,
$-5x = 10$,
$x = -2$.

This again leads to a negative number of 10-cent coins, which is not possible. Let's try another approach.

We can express $x$ in terms of $y$ from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation again, but this time, we will carefully check the calculations.

$10x + 5y = 75$ can be simplified by dividing the entire equation by 5:

$2x + y = 15$.

Now we have a simpler system of equations:

1. $x + y = 17$
2. $2x + y = 15$

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:

$(2x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 17$,
$x = -2$.

This again leads to a negative number of 10-cent coins, which is not possible. We need to recheck the problem statement and our calculations.

Let's solve the system of equations again carefully.

From the equation $x + y = 17$, we get $x = 17 - y$. Substitute this into the equation $10x + 5y = 75$:

$170 - 10y + 5y = 75$,

The problem involves selecting random prime numbers from the first six prime numbers, which are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We need to find the probability that the sum of the two selected numbers is even.

[ADVANCE]

To have an even sum, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd. Among the first six prime numbers, only 2 is even, and the remaining five numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd.

The total number of ways to choose two prime numbers from the six prime numbers is \(6 \times 6 = 36\), since each person can choose any of the six prime numbers.

To find the number of favorable outcomes (i.e., the sum is even), we consider two cases:
1. Both numbers are even: There is only 1 even number (2), so the number of ways to choose two even numbers is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).
2. Both numbers are odd: There are 5 odd numbers, so the number of ways to choose two odd numbers is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

The total number of favorable outcomes is \(1 + 25 = 26\).

Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation: $2b = 0$.

The problem involves finding the total shaded area in a 4x3 grid of unit squares. The grid consists of 12 unit squares, and the shaded areas are formed by triangles created by drawing diagonals from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corners of the squares in the first row.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the total shaded area, we need to calculate the area of the two shaded triangles. The first triangle is formed by the diagonal from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner of the second square in the first row. The base of this triangle is 2 units (from x=0 to x=2) and the height is 4 units (from y=0 to y=4). The area of this triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of first triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]
The second triangle is formed by the diagonal from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner of the third square in the first row. The base of this triangle is 3 units (from x=0 to x=3) and the height is 4 units (from y=0 to y=4). The area of this triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of second triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6
\]
However, we need to subtract the area of the first triangle from the area of the second triangle to get the shaded area, but we also need to consider the unshaded triangle that is part of the second triangle. The unshaded triangle has a base of 1 unit (from x=2 to x=3) and a height of 4 units (from y=0 to y=4). The area of the unshaded triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of unshaded triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 4 = 2
\]
So, the total shaded area is the area of the second triangle minus the area of the unshaded triangle:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = 6 - 2 = 4
\]
But we also have the first triangle which is shaded, so the total shaded area is:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = 4 + (6 - 4) = 4 + 2 = 6 - 2 = 4
\]
We can see that the total shaded area is actually the area of the first triangle plus the area of the part of the second triangle that is shaded, which is the area of the second triangle minus the area of the first triangle.

The problem asks for the minimum positive product of a number that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, given the number is 450.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum positive product of a number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to find the smallest number of the form composed of 0s and 1s that is greater than or equal to 450.

We can start by finding the smallest number composed of 0s and 1s that is greater than or equal to 450. The number should be in the form of $111\ldots10$ or $111\ldots1$ because any number starting with 0 is not valid, and we want to minimize the number of digits.

Let's calculate the value of the smallest number composed of 1s that is greater than or equal to 450. The number $1111$ is the smallest number composed of 1s that is greater than 450.

The value of $1111$ is $1 \times 10^3 + 1 \times 10^2 + 1 \times 10^1 + 1 \times 10^0 = 1111$.

The product of the digits of $1111$ is $1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1$.

The problem requires finding the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$, which has a terminating decimal expansion. We need to express the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10, and then find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To convert the denominator to a power of 10, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $5^8 \cdot 2^7$, since $5^7 \cdot 2^8 \cdot 5^8 \cdot 2^7 = 10^{15}$. This gives us:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321 \cdot 5^8 \cdot 2^7}{10^{15}}.
\]
Now, we calculate the numerator:
\[
4321 \cdot 5^8 \cdot 2^7 = 4321 \cdot 390625 \cdot 128 = 4321 \cdot 50000000 = 216050000000.

So, the fraction becomes:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to rewrite the expression in terms of sines of angles between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$. This gives us:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. So, the expression becomes:
\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2.
\]
Next, we need to find the value of $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x-y) - \cos (x+y)]$ to simplify the product $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$. First, we multiply and divide by $2\cos 20^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{2 \cos 20^\circ} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \cdot 2 \cos 20^\circ) \sin 80^\circ.
\]
Using the identity $\sin x \cos y = \frac{1}{2} [\sin (x+y) + \sin (x-y)]$, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \sin 40^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{2 \cos 20^\circ} \left(\frac{1}{2} \sin 40^\circ \cdot 2 \cos 20^\circ\right) \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ.
\]
Now, we multiply and divide by $2\cos 40^\circ$:
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{2 \cos 40^\circ} (\sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ \cdot 2 \cos 40^\circ).
\]
Using the identity $\sin x \cos y = \frac{1}{2} [\sin (x+y) + \sin (x-y)]$ again, we get:
\[
\sin 40^\circ \cos 40^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \sin 80^\circ,
\]
so the expression becomes:
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{2 \cos 40^\circ} \left(\frac{1}{2} \sin 80^\circ \cdot 2 \cos 40^\circ\right) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 120^\circ.
\]
Since $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we have:
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{32}.
\]
Now, we can find the value of the original expression:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{32}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{1024} = \frac{9}{4096}.

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

[ADVANCE]

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we first need to express $g(x)$ in terms of $x$. Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, we substitute $x + 5$ into the function $f(x)$:

\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015. \]

However, we don't need to expand this expression to find the sum of the roots. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is related to the coefficients of the polynomial.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient and $b$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term. Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are the roots of $f(x)$ shifted by $-5$. If the roots of $f(x)$ are $r_1, r_2, r_3$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is the sum of the coefficients of the $x^2$ term divided by the negative of the leading coefficient. For $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, the sum of the roots is $49$.

Since the roots of $g(x)$ are the roots of $f(x)$ shifted by $-5$, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression as:

Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\), we can further rewrite the expression as:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.

This simplifies to:

\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. Let's denote the unknown interior angle as $x$. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except the unknown angle is $1070^{\circ}$, so the sum of all interior angles is $1070^{\circ} + x$.

Since the sum of all interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$, we can set up the equation:
\[
1070^{\circ} + x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}
\]
We also know that the unknown angle $x$ is an interior angle of the polygon, so it must satisfy $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$.

[ADVANCE]

We can express $x$ as:
\[
x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}
\]
Since $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$, we can set up the inequality:
\[
0^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}
\]
We can split this inequality into two parts:
\[
0^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}
\]
and
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}

Solving the first inequality:
\[
1070^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}
\]
\[
\frac{1070^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}} < n-2
\]
\[
5.944 < n-2
\]
\[
7.944 < n

Since $n$ must be an integer, we have:
\[
n \geq 8
\]
Solving the second inequality:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 180^{\circ} + 1070^{\circ}
\]
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ}

\[
n-2 < \frac{1250^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}}
\]
\[
n-2 < 6.944

\[
n < 8.944

Since $n$ must be an integer, we have:
\[
n \leq 8

Combining the two results, we get:
\[

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence equation. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). In modulo 23, the formula becomes:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]

By testing values, we find that \( 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Next, we can substitute these values back into the equation for \( t \):
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
and
\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( t \) must be an odd integer, we discard \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \) and keep \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

The problem involves converting the volume of a cube from cubic feet to the surface area in square inches. We need to follow these steps: 
1. Convert the volume of the cube from cubic feet to cubic inches.
2. Determine the side length of the cube in inches.
3. Calculate the surface area of the cube in square inches.

[ADVANCE]

1. We know that $1$ cubic foot is equal to $12^3 = 1728$ cubic inches. So, the volume of the cube is $1728$ cubic inches.
2. Let the side length of the cube be $s$ inches. Since the volume of the cube is $s^3$, we have $s^3 = 1728$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $s = \sqrt[3]{1728} = 12$ inches.
3. The surface area of a cube is given by $6s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. Substituting $s = 12$ inches, we get the surface area as $6 \times 12^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864$ square inches.

To find the product of $5+\sqrt{3}$ and its conjugate $5-\sqrt{3}$, we can use the difference of squares formula: $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$. Here, $a = 5$ and $b = \sqrt{3}$.

This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term $a_1$ is 1 and the common difference $d$ is 2.

The general formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

We are given two functions: $f(x) = 2x - 3$ and $g(x) = x + 1$. We need to find the value of $g(f(5) - 1)$.

First, we need to calculate $f(5)$. Substituting $x = 5$ into the function $f(x)$, we get:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7. \]

Next, we need to calculate $f(5) - 1$, which is $7 - 1 = 6$.

Now, we need to find $g(f(5) - 1) = g(6)$. Substituting $x = 6$ into the function $g(x)$, we get:

The problem involves finding the values of \(x\) that satisfy the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\).

We need to use the properties of inverse trigonometric functions and trigonometric identities to simplify the expression inside the sine function.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1} (x)\) is \(\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\), we can simplify the expression using the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\).

Therefore, \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\).

Now, we can substitute this into the original equation:
\[\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have:
\[1 = \frac{1}{3}.\]

This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the equation holds for all \(x \neq 0\) is incorrect. However, we need to re-evaluate the problem to find the correct solution.

However, we need to consider the correct interpretation of the equation. Let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), then \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\).

Substituting this into the original equation, we get:
\[\sin \left( \theta + \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]

This simplifies to:
\[\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]

As we already know, \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), which leads to a contradiction. This means we need to reconsider the problem.

Let's use the fact that \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) and the given equation to find the correct solution.

We can use the sine addition formula:
\[\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.\]

Let \(A = \tan^{-1} (x)\) and \(B = \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\). Then:

We know that \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\), \(\cos \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\), \(\sin \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\), and \(\cos \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\).

Substituting these values, we get:
\[\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} = \frac{1}{3}.\]

This simplifies to:
\[\frac{x^2}{x^2+1} + \frac{1}{x^2+1} = \frac{1}{3}.\]

Combining the fractions, we get:

The problem involves finding the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The lines are given in vector form, and we need to use the formula for the distance between parallel lines.

The first line is given by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
The second line is given by:
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Since the lines are parallel, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so the lines are indeed parallel.

To find the distance between the lines, we can use the formula:
\[d = \frac{\| \mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|},\]
where \(\mathbf{PQ}\) is the vector between a point on the first line and a point on the second line, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

Let's choose \(\mathbf{P} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{Q} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). Then, \(\mathbf{PQ} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

The direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we need to find the cross product \(\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}\):
\[\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2) = \mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Now, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[\| \mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.\]

We also need the magnitude of the direction vector:
\[\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.\]

Finally, the distance between the lines is:
\[d = \frac{\| \mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.\]

Using the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, we can rewrite this as:
\[= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}).\]
Since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, the expression simplifies to:

We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so we can substitute this in:
\[= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})\]

- 12 stamps from France, each priced at 4 cents
- 6 stamps from Peru, each priced at 4 cents
- 13 stamps from Spain, each priced at 5 cents

We can calculate the total cost of stamps from each country in the 70's:

- Total cost of French stamps: $12 \times 4 = 48$ cents
- Total cost of Peruvian stamps: $6 \times 4 = 24$ cents

The total number of stamps in the 70's is $12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43$.
The total cost of all stamps in the 70's is $72 + 48 + 24 + 65 = 209$ cents.

Let's denote the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$, the length of $\overline{AD}$ as $a$, and the length of $\overline{BC}$ as $b$.

The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$, which is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAD$, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{h}{h} = 1 \implies a = b
\]
However, this is not correct in the context of a trapezoid, so we need to reconsider the relationship between the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and trapezoid $ABCD$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{CD}$, $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle.

Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height of both $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ACB$, the area of $\triangle ACB$ is:
\[
[\triangle ACB] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]
The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ACB$:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ACB] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAD$, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ACB$ is equal to the ratio of the lengths of $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ACB]} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
Let's denote $[\triangle ACD]$ as $x$ and $[\triangle ACB]$ as $y$. We have:
\[
x + y = 42
\]
and
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
Since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$ and $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAD$, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem in the context of the trapezoid. The theorem implies that the ratio of the areas of the two triangles formed by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two parallel sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{a}{b} = \frac{AD}{BC}
\]
Since $AD$ and $BC$ are the parallel sides of the trapezoid, and $AC$ is the height, we can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of the two triangles. Given that $x + y = 42$, and considering the properties of the angle bisector, we can infer that the areas of the two triangles are equal because the angle bisector divides the trapezoid into two triangles with equal areas.

Therefore, we have:
\[
x = y
\]
So,
\[
x + x = 42 \implies 2x = 42 \implies x = 21
\]
Thus, the area of $\triangle ACD$ is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \boxed{14}

The problem involves solving an equation with a square root to find the value of $x$. The equation is $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots. This gives us:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]
Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]
Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for $x$:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
9 = 27x - 8x
\]
\[
9 = 19x
\]
Solving for $x$, we find:
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Next action: [VERIFY]
We need to check if the solution $x = \frac{9}{19}$ satisfies the original equation and ensures that the expressions under the square roots are non-negative. Substituting $x = \frac{9}{19}$ into the original equation, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27-19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
This confirms that $x = \frac{9}{19}$ is a valid solution to the original equation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can substitute the given fractions into the operation definition. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, we have $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Plugging these values into the operation definition, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

Now, we can simplify the expression:
\[
(7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \cdot 21}{30} = \frac{1470}{30} = 49

The problem involves finding the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, of a circle intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the order in which the points are chosen is essential. We can fix the points $A$ and $B$ and then consider the relative positions of points $C$ and $D$ with respect to $A$ and $B$.

When $A$ and $B$ are fixed, the chord $AB$ divides the circle into two arcs. For the chords $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, points $C$ and $D$ must be on opposite arcs of the circle with respect to $AB$.

[ADVANCE]

We can calculate the probability by considering the possible positions of points $C$ and $D$ relative to the arc $AB$. If we fix point $C$ on the circle, point $D$ must lie on the opposite arc of $AB$ to ensure the chords intersect. Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, the probability that point $D$ lies on the opposite arc of $AB$ is the same as the probability that it does not lie on the same arc as point $C$ with respect to $AB$.

Given that point $C$ can be on either arc, the probability that point $D$ is on the opposite arc to make the chords intersect is $\frac{1}{2}$.

However, we need to consider the total probability by integrating over all possible positions of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. But due to the symmetry and uniform distribution of the points on the circle, the probability remains the same regardless of the positions of $A$ and $B$.

Thus, the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $\frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}$, but we need to confirm this by ensuring we have considered all possible configurations.

[ADVANCE]

Upon further consideration, we realize that the probability of intersection is indeed independent of the specific positions of $A$ and $B$ due to the symmetry of the circle. The key insight is that for any given position of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, the chords will intersect if and only if the points are arranged such that $C$ and $D$ are on opposite arcs with respect to $AB$.

Given the random and independent selection of points, the probability of this arrangement is indeed $\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the final answer is:

$\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$

The problem involves finding the value of an expression containing inverse trigonometric functions and trigonometric functions. We need to use the properties of inverse trigonometric functions and trigonometric identities to simplify the expression.

Let's denote $\alpha = \arcsin 0.4$ and $\beta = \arcsin 0.5$. Then, we have $\sin \alpha = 0.4$ and $\sin \beta = 0.5$. We need to find $\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)$.

Using the angle sum and difference identities for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha
\]

We also know that $\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$ and $\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Now, we can substitute these values into the expressions for $\sin (\alpha + \beta)$ and $\sin (\beta - \alpha)$:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{25} = \frac{5\sqrt{21} - 4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}
\]

Next, we need to find the product $\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)$:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})\sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2\sqrt{63} + 21}{500} = \frac{2 \cdot 3\sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{6\sqrt{7} + 21}{500}
\]

However, we can simplify this problem using the product-to-sum identities. We know that:
\[
\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) - \cos (A + B)]
\]
Let $A = \alpha + \beta$ and $B = \beta - \alpha$. Then:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos ((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha)) - \cos ((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha))] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2\alpha) - \cos (2\beta)]
\]
We also know that $\cos (2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta$. So:
\[
\cos (2\alpha) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]
\[
\cos (2\beta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]
Now, we can substitute these values into the expression:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.18 = 0.09
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression is $\boxed{0.09}$.

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 from the Buddhist party and 6 from the Democratic party) without any restrictions. Then, we subtract the number of ways to form a committee with only members from one party.

The total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

The number of ways to form a committee with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a committee minus the number of ways to form a committee with only members from one party:

The problem asks for the value of $513^2 - 487^2$. This is a difference of squares, which can be factored as $(a+b)(a-b)$.

Calculate the values inside the parentheses: $513+487 = 1000$ and $513-487 = 26$. So, the expression becomes $1000 \cdot 26$.

The problem requires finding the positive value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$.

[ADVANCE]
We start by isolating the expression inside the cube root. Since $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$, we can cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube root:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3.
\]
Calculating $16^3$, we get:
\[
16^3 = 4096.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.
\]
Next, we can simplify the equation by moving 4096 to the left side:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -4092$.

[ADVANCE]
We can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}.
\]
Since $\sqrt{16384} = 128$, the equation simplifies to:
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}.
\]
This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66,
\]
and
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62.
\]
Since the problem asks for the positive value of $x$, we select the positive solution:
\[
x = 66.
\]

The positive value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$ is $\boxed{66}$.

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} - 2 \pi \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

So the expression becomes \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the expression. However, it's more efficient to use the fact that the product of cosines of angles that are symmetric around \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) can be simplified using the formula for the product of cosines.

We can use the identity:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}
\]
for \(x = \frac{2\pi}{15}\).

So, we have:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16 \cdot 2 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{32 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{32 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( 2 \pi + \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{16}

The problem involves finding the median of a sequence of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is $3^7$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$. Since the sequence consists of 27 consecutive integers, the terms can be written as $a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum is:
\[ a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26) = 27a + (0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + 26) \]
The sum of the first 26 positive integers is:
\[ 0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + 26 = \frac{26 \cdot 27}{2} = 351 \]
So, the sum of the sequence is:
\[ 27a + 351 = 3^7 \]
We know that $3^7 = 2187$, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 27a + 351 = 2187 \]
Solving for $a$:
\[ 27a = 2187 - 351 \]
\[ 27a = 1836 \]
\[ a = \frac{1836}{27} \]
\[ a = 68 \]
The sequence of integers is $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$.

Since the sequence has 27 terms (an odd number), the median is the middle term, which is the 14th term. The 14th term of the sequence is:
\[ a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81 \]
So, the median of the sequence is $\boxed{81}$.

Let's start by analyzing the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can simplify the problem by letting $y = x^2$, which transforms the inequality into $-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21$. Now, we need to solve this inequality for $y$.

First, we solve the inequality $y^2 + 4y > -4$. We can rewrite it as $y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0$, which factors into $(y + 2)^2 > 0$. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, $(y + 2)^2 \geq 0$, and the inequality $(y + 2)^2 > 0$ is true for all real $y$ except $y = -2$.

Next, we solve the inequality $y^2 + 4y < 21$. We can rewrite it as $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. Factoring the quadratic expression, we get $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. The roots of the equation $(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0$ are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Using the sign chart method, we find that the inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ is satisfied when $-7 < y < 3$.

Since $y = x^2$, we know that $y \geq 0$. Combining this with the inequality $-7 < y < 3$, we get $0 \leq y < 3$. Substituting back $y = x^2$, we have $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which is equivalent to $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,$ we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we need to express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in terms of $xy + yz + zx.$ We can use the identity:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $x + y + z$ by $p$ and $xy + yz + zx$ by $q.$ Then, we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = p^2 - 2q.\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 2q - q) = p(p^2 - 3q).\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We also know the equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be factored as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = xy(p - z) + xz(p - y) + yz(p - x) = 12.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[p(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $xyz = 4$ and $xy + xz + yz = q,$ we have:
\[pq - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to:
\[pq - 12 = 12,\]
so:
\[pq = 24.\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We now have two equations:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q)\]
and
\[pq = 24.\]
We can solve for $q$ in terms of $p$ from the second equation:
\[q = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = p\left(p^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{p}\right) = p(p^2 - \frac{72}{p}) = p^3 - 72.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[p^3 = 64,\]
so:
\[p = 4.\]
Now, substituting $p = 4$ back into the equation $pq = 24,$ we get:
\[4q = 24,\]
so:
\[q = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $q = 6.$

   - Number of female bus riders: $13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4$
   - $135\%$ of the number of female bus riders: $1.35 \times 41.4 = 56.39$

4. **Grade 12:**
   - Number of male bus riders: $11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8$
   - Number of female bus riders: $8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8$
   - $135\%$ of the number of female bus riders: $1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.83$

Next, we need to find the grade level where the number of male bus riders is closest to $135\%$ of the number of female bus riders. We will calculate the absolute difference between the number of male bus riders and $135\%$ of the number of female bus riders for each grade level.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which can be written as \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\). The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which can be factored as \(x(x-36)\).

So, the inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator \(x(x-36)\) and the points where the expression inside the absolute value is zero, i.e., \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

However, we must exclude the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, i.e., \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), because the expression is undefined at these points.

To solve the inequality, we need to consider the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into the following intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied.

[ADVANCE]

For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{(-10)(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{(-1)(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{(1)(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 18\):
\[
\frac{|(18-9)(18+9)|}{(18)(18-36)} = \frac{|(9)(27)|}{(18)(-18)} = \frac{243}{-324} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
\[
\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{(40)(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{(40)(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

[ADVANCE]

From the above tests, we see that the inequality is satisfied in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the inequality is strict (<), we do not include the endpoints.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this side as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, $\sin T = \frac{\text{opposite side to } T}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{s}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

Therefore, the value of $\sin T$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.

The problem asks for the shortest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. The distance between the origin and a point $(x, y)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint that the point lies on the given curve.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The distance $D$ between the origin and a point $(x, y)$ on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is given by:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^2-3\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9\right)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the square of the distance, $D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$. Let's denote $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$ and find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
The critical points are $x = 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$, and $x = -\sqrt{2}$. We need to evaluate the second derivative to determine the nature of these critical points:
\[ f''(x) = 6x^2 - 4 \]
Evaluating the second derivative at the critical points:
\[ f''(0) = -4 < 0 \]
\[ f''(\sqrt{2}) = f''(-\sqrt{2}) = 6(\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 > 0 \]
Since $f''(\sqrt{2}) > 0$ and $f''(-\sqrt{2}) > 0$, the function has a local minimum at $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $x = -\sqrt{2}$. We can now find the minimum value of $f(x)$ at these points:
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
The minimum value of $D^2$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, so the minimum value of $D$ is:
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The distance can be expressed in the form $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) and asked to find the value of \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \). To do this, we need to find the inverse values of 0 and 6 for the function \( f(x) \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3-x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3+2x^2+3x & \text{if } x>3.
\end{array}
\right. \]

We will first find \( f^{-1}(0) \) and then \( f^{-1}(6) \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find \( f^{-1}(0) \), we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \). We will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid.

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, we need to find \( f^{-1}(6) \). We will again consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation, but it is not necessary since we already have a valid solution from the first case.

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Next, we can calculate the sum \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to the other five vertices. The distances from $P$ to the five known vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The key insight here is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. Let's denote the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex as $x$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to all six vertices is the same for any point $P$ in space.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the five known vertices is:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324.\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to all six vertices is constant, we can set up the equation:
\[324 + x^2 = \text{constant}.\]

However, we need to find the constant value. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices is the same as the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. The center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices, and the distance from the center to any vertex is the same.

For a regular octahedron with side length $a$, the distance from the center to any vertex is $\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is:
\[6 \left(\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = 6 \cdot \frac{a^2}{2} = 3a^2.\]

We can also find the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices using the given distances. Let's denote the side length of the octahedron as $a$. The sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 3a^2.\]
Since the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the five known vertices is 324, we have:
\[324 + x^2 = 3a^2.\]

We also know that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 3a^2.\]
Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices:
\[324 + x^2 = 3a^2.\]

We can also find the value of $a^2$ by using the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. The sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is:

\[3a^2 = 324 + x^2.\]
We also know that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices.

The problem involves comparing the acceleration of a soft ball and a baseball given the same force. We need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), or \( F = ma \).

Given:
- Mass of the soft ball, \( m_{\text{soft}} = 200 \) grams
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{base}} = 150 \) grams
- The force applied to both balls is the same.

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball.

[ADVANCE]

Since the force applied to both balls is the same, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ F = m_{\text{soft}} \cdot a_{\text{soft}} = m_{\text{base}} \cdot a_{\text{base}} \]

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio of the accelerations:
\[ \frac{a_{\text{soft}}}{a_{\text{base}}} = \frac{m_{\text{base}}}{m_{\text{soft}}} \]

Substituting the given masses:
\[ \frac{a_{\text{soft}}}{a_{\text{base}}} = \frac{150 \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ grams}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

First, we need to convert the decimal number $629_{10}$ to its base 7 and base 8 representations.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 7:
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 4
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation: $1554_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 8:
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.
\[

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6

\[

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1

To calculate the number of handshakes, we need to consider the interactions between the 6 mothers and the 10 fathers. Each mother will shake hands with each father, but no mother will shake hands with another mother, and no father will shake hands with another father.

The number of handshakes between 6 mothers and 10 fathers can be calculated as the product of the number of mothers and the number of fathers, since each mother shakes hands with each father exactly once.

So, the total number of handshakes is $6 \times 10 = 60$.

We are given a polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \) and we need to find the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \). The task is to find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to find \( g(1) \), which is equivalent to \( f(1-1) = f(0) \).

However, we can also directly substitute \( x = 1 \) into the expression for \( g(x) \), which is \( f(x-1) \). This means we need to find \( f(1-1) = f(0) \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, let's calculate \( f(0) \) using the given polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \).

\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

So, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) = f(0) = -2 \).

The problem requires finding the shortest distance from the point $(6, 0)$ to the line $y = 2x - 2$. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)$. Now, we can substitute these values into the distance formula.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]
To simplify the answer, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:
\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The given polynomial equation is $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, for a polynomial $x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0$, the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2 = 0,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0 = 2.
\]
We need to find the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. Let's denote these expressions as $p = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $q = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $r = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$.

From the second Vieta's formula, we have:
\[
p + q + r = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
We also know that:
\[
pqr = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Using the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2$, we can express $pqr$ in terms of the roots:
\[
pqr = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) \left( \frac{1}{\alpha_1\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3\alpha_4} \right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expressions $p$, $q$, and $r$ are the roots of the polynomial whose coefficients are symmetric functions of the roots of the original polynomial. We can use the fact that the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is zero to find the values of $p$, $q$, and $r$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We know that $p + q + r = 0$. We also know that the product of the roots taken four at a time is 2, so we can use this information to find the product $pqr$. Since $pqr = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)$, we can expand this product and use the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2$ to simplify it.

However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the polynomial whose roots are $p$, $q$, and $r$ can be derived from the original polynomial. The polynomial whose roots are the sums and products of the roots of the original polynomial can be found by considering the symmetric functions of the roots.

Given that $p + q + r = 0$, we can assume that $p$, $q$, and $r$ are the roots of a polynomial of the form $t^3 + at + b = 0$. We also know that the product of the roots of this polynomial is $-b = pqr$. Since the original polynomial is $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$, we can use the fact that the product of the roots taken four at a time is 2 to find the value of $pqr$.

By Vieta's formulas for the polynomial whose roots are $p$, $q$, and $r$, we have:
\[
pqr = -2.
\]
Since $p + q + r = 0$ and $pqr = -2$, we can conclude that the values of $p$, $q$, and $r$ are the roots of the polynomial $t^3 + 2 = 0$. Solving this polynomial, we get:
\[
t^3 = -2 \implies t = \sqrt[3]{-2} = -\sqrt[3]{2}.
\]
The roots of the polynomial are $-\sqrt[3]{2}$, $\omega \sqrt[3]{2}$, and $\omega^2 \sqrt[3]{2}$, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity. However, since the problem asks for the set of values, we can conclude that the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$ are the same up to permutation.

To convert the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$ to its decimal form, we can perform the division $137 \div 500$. Alternatively, we can manipulate the fraction to express it in a form that is easier to convert to a decimal. Notice that $500 = 5 \times 100$, so we can rewrite the fraction as:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137}{5 \times 100} = \frac{137 \times 2}{10 \times 100} = \frac{274}{1000} = 0.274

To solve this problem, we need to determine the region within the rectangle where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices. This region is defined by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting the center to each vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting the center $O$ to each vertex will form a smaller square inside the rectangle. The vertices of this smaller square will be the midpoints of the segments connecting the center to each vertex. Let's denote the width of the rectangle as $w$ and the length as $kw$. The distance from the center to each vertex is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{kw}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{w}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{k^2+1}}{2}w$.

The side length of the smaller square will be the distance between the midpoints of the segments connecting the center to two adjacent vertices. This distance is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{k^2+1}}{2}w = \frac{\sqrt{2(k^2+1)}}{4}w$.

The area of the smaller square is $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2(k^2+1)}}{4}w\right)^2 = \frac{2(k^2+1)}{16}w^2 = \frac{k^2+1}{8}w^2$.

The area of the rectangle is $kw \cdot w = kw^2$.

The probability that a randomly selected point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle: $\frac{\frac{k^2+1}{8}w^2}{kw^2} = \frac{k^2+1}{8k}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) is less than 4, we use the part of the definition \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \) for \( n < 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the part of the definition \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \) for \( n \geq 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the part of the definition \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \) for \( n \geq 4 \).

The field has a width of 300 feet and a length of 400 feet.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the distance Jim travels, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, since he walks diagonally across the rectangular field. The diagonal distance \(d\) can be calculated as:
\[ d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

Martha walks along the perimeter of the field, so the distance she travels is the sum of the length and width of the field:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Martha} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ feet} \]

However, since Martha walks to the same point as Jim, she must have walked the length and then the width, which is the same as the perimeter of the rectangle formed by the length and width. But since she is walking to the same point as Jim, she must have walked the length and then the width, which is 300 + 400 = 700 feet, but we need to consider the actual path she took to reach the same point as Jim, which is the point where the diagonal ends. So, she must have walked the length and then the width to reach that point, which is the same as the perimeter of the rectangle formed by the length and width.

Next, we need to find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha is:

The problem is to find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha. Jim walks diagonally across a rectangular field with a width of 300 feet and a length of 400 feet, while Martha walks along the perimeter of the field to the same point as Jim.

The distance Jim travels is the diagonal of the rectangle, which is:
\[ d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

The distance Martha travels is the sum of the length and width of the field:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Martha} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ feet} \]

The difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance traveled by Martha} - \text{Distance traveled by Jim} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Jim walks \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Martha.

We are given that $\omega$ is a complex number such that $\omega^3 = 1.$ We need to find the possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.$

[ADVANCE]

Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2,$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}.$ These roots satisfy the equation $\omega^3 - 1 = 0,$ which can be factored as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.$ Since $\omega \neq 1,$ we have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$

We can use this relationship to simplify the given expression. First, we find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.\]
Since $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0,$ the numerator simplifies to $2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.$ Also, since $\omega^3 = 1,$ the denominator simplifies to $1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.$ Therefore, the expression simplifies to
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.\]

[OUTPUT]

The possible value of the expression is $\boxed{1}.$

The problem asks for the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once. This is a classic example of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a complete graph with 4 vertices.

We need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and find the minimum distance.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We will calculate the total distance for each possible route. There are $4! = 24$ possible permutations of the points, but since the route is a cycle, we can fix the starting point and consider the remaining 3 points. This reduces the number of unique routes to $3! = 6$ for each starting point, but we only need to consider each route once, so we will calculate the distance for each unique route.

The distances between the points are given in the diagram:
- $AB = 6$
- $AC = 6$
- $AD = 5$
- $BC = 5$
- $BD = 3$
- $CD = 4$

We will calculate the total distance for each possible route:

1. Starting at $A$: $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$
2. Starting at $A$: $A \to B \to D \to C \to A$
3. Starting at $A$: $A \to C \to B \to D \to A$
4. Starting at $A$: $A \to C \to D \to B \to A$
5. Starting at $A$: $A \to D \to B \to C \to A$
6. Starting at $A$: $A \to D \to C \to B \to A$

We will calculate the total distance for each route:

1. $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$: $6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20$
2. $A \to B \to D \to C \to A$: $6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19$
3. $A \to C \to B \to D \to A$: $6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 19$
4. $A \to C \to D \to B \to A$: $6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19$
5. $A \to D \to B \to C \to A$: $5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19$
6. $A \to D \to C \to B \to A$: $5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20$

The shortest distance is $\boxed{19}$.
