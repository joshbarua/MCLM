We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can substitute the given value of $\sin D$ and the length of $EF$ to find the length of $DF$. We have:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($DF$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($DE$ and $EF$). Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Solving for $DE^2$, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given the complex numbers $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$, which is the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by an angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in the counterclockwise direction.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for rotating a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta}. \]
In this case, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, so $e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to calculate $z - c$:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3i - 3\sqrt{2}i = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i. \]
Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} = (\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + (\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Simplifying the expression:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = 1 - \frac{3 + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}i + i - \frac{3 + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}i^2 = 1 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i + i + \frac{3 + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Combining like terms:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{3 + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} + i - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 1 + \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + i - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i. \]
Simplifying further:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} + i - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 3}{2}i = 1 + 3\sqrt{2} + i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 3}{2}i. \]
Now, we add $c$ to $(z - c) e^{i\pi/4}$ to get $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (2 - 3i) + (1 + 3\sqrt{2} + i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 3}{2}i) = 2 + 1 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3i + i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 3}{2}i. \]
Combining like terms:
\[ w = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3i + i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 3}{2}i = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} - \frac{6 + 3\sqrt{2} + 3}{2}i = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} - \frac{9 + 3\sqrt{2}}{2}i. \]
Simplifying further:
\[ w = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} - \frac{9}{2}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 3 + 3\sqrt{2} - \frac{9 + 3\sqrt{2}}{2}i. \]

The problem requires us to find the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table, with the condition that 3 specific people (Pir, Rza, and Thomas) must sit next to each other.

First, we can treat the 3 people (Pir, Rza, and Thomas) as a single unit or block, since they must sit together. This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 people and the remaining 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange the 6 units around the circular table is $(6-1)! = 5!$.

Within the block of 3 people, there are $3!$ ways to arrange Pir, Rza, and Thomas.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the circular table, with Pir, Rza, and Thomas sitting next to each other, is $5! \times 3!$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the value of $5! \times 3!$.

$5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$

$3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

So, the total number of ways is $120 \times 6 = 720$.

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term where the power of \(x\) is zero.

The general term in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^r\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\).

The general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{r} (10x^3)^{5-r} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^r\).

[ADVANCE]

To find the constant term, we need the power of \(x\) in the general term to be zero. The power of \(x\) in the general term is given by \(3(5-r) - 2r = 15 - 3r - 2r = 15 - 5r\). Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[15 - 5r = 0 \implies r = 3.\]

So, the constant term corresponds to the term when \(r = 3\). Substituting \(r = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3.\]

Simplifying this expression, we have:
\[\binom{5}{3} (10)^2 (x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 (x^2)^{-3} = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \cdot x^{-6} = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \cdot x^0.\]

Since \(x^0 = 1\), the constant term is:
\[\binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125.\]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

We can rewrite the expression in terms of $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},

\[

The problem involves finding the minimum angle by which a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise around its center to return to its original position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and the total angle around the center is 360 degrees. To find the minimum angle of rotation that brings the pentagon back to its original position, we need to divide the total angle by the number of sides.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The minimum angle of rotation can be calculated by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides of the pentagon, which is 5.

\[

\nIn a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex. Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)

\nNow, we can also calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and $(x, y)$, which should be equal to the midpoint we just calculated:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
\nBy equating the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
\nHowever, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 6$ is not a valid solution. Let's try another combination of vertices to form the diagonals. We can calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)

\nBy equating the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4

\nNow, we can also calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and $(x, y)$, which should be equal to the midpoint we just calculated:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
\nBy equating the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
\nBy equating the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9

The problem involves finding the sum of the values of the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \).

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as the function is undefined at these points.

To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to examine the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \). We can factorize the quadratic expression:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

To find the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

Let's denote the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) as \( A \). We want to find the smallest \( C \) such that \(\| A \bold{v} \| \le C \| \bold{v} \|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\).

The expression \(\| A \bold{v} \|\) represents the norm of the vector \( A \bold{v} \), and \(\| \bold{v} \|\) represents the norm of the vector \(\bold{v}\).

To find the smallest \( C \), we can use the fact that the matrix norm induced by the vector norm is the smallest number \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all vectors. The matrix norm induced by the Euclidean norm (also known as the spectral norm) is the largest singular value of the matrix.

The singular values of a matrix \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \), where \( A^T \) is the transpose of \( A \).

Let's calculate the singular values of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[ \det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 \]

We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0 \) to find the eigenvalues:
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2} \]

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are \( \lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2} \) and \( \lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2} \).

The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues:
\[ \sigma_1 = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}, \quad \sigma_2 = \sqrt{\frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}} \]

The largest singular value is \( \sigma_1 = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}} \).

Therefore, the smallest \( C \) such that the inequality \(\| A \bold{v} \| \le C \| \bold{v} \|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is \( \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}} \).

However, we can also consider the operator norm of the matrix, which is the maximum of the norms of the matrix applied to the unit vectors. For a 2x2 matrix, this can be computed as the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix \( A^T A \).

Let's calculate the value of \( \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}} \) to find the smallest \( C \).

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express the equation as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. Factoring this equation, we get:
\[
(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]
Given that $z \neq 1$, it follows that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$. We can use this equation to find the value of the expression.

[ADVANCE]

We can express $\frac{1}{z}$ and $\frac{1}{z^2}$ in terms of $z$. Since $z^5 = 1$, we have $\frac{1}{z} = z^4$ and $\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3$. Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

We recognize that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$, so $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

The number $58_9$ in base 10 is:

\[\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.\]

\[\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.\]
Using the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\), we can simplify the expression further:
\[\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.\]

We need to determine the weight relationship between trikes, golf balls, and scoops. Let's denote the weight of a trike as $T$, the weight of a golf ball as $G$, and the weight of a scoop as $S$.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Three trikes and one scoop weigh the same as four golf balls: $3T + S = 4G$.
2. Two trikes and one golf ball weigh the same as one scoop: $2T + G = S$.

We need to find how many trikes weigh the same as one scoop, i.e., we need to find the value of $\frac{S}{T}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the second equation to express $S$ in terms of $T$ and $G$: $S = 2T + G$.

Now, substitute this expression for $S$ into the first equation: $3T + (2T + G) = 4G$.

Simplify the equation: $5T + G = 4G$.

Rearrange the equation to isolate $G$: $5T = 3G$, so $G = \frac{5T}{3}$.

Now, substitute $G = \frac{5T}{3}$ back into the expression for $S$: $S = 2T + \frac{5T}{3} = \frac{6T + 5T}{3} = \frac{11T}{3}$.

This gives us the weight of one scoop in terms of the weight of one trike: $S = \frac{11T}{3}$.

To find how many trikes weigh the same as one scoop, we calculate $\frac{S}{T} = \frac{\frac{11T}{3}}{T} = \frac{11}{3}$.

Therefore, the weight of one scoop is equal to the weight of $\frac{11}{3}$ trikes.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires us to find the number of trikes that weigh the same as one scoop. We started by assessing the given information and then used the equations to express the weight of a scoop in terms of the weight of a trike. After substituting and simplifying the equations, we found that the weight of one scoop is equal to the weight of $\frac{11}{3}$ trikes.

We are given two polynomials and their product. We need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ by comparing the coefficients of the product of the two polynomials with the given product.

The product of the two polynomials is:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6
\]

We will expand the left-hand side and compare the coefficients with the right-hand side.

[ADVANCE]

We expand the product of the two polynomials:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 3t^2(4t^2+bt-2) + 5t(4t^2+bt-2) + a(4t^2+bt-2)

\[

We compare the coefficients of the expanded form with the given product $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we get the following equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26

\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-10 + ab = -16

\[

We solve the equations one by one. From the last equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute $a = -3$ into the third equation:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by substituting them into the first equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]
This is true, so our values are correct. Now, we can find $a + b$:

The problem involves a cylindrical tank being filled with water at a rate of $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius of the tank.

[ADVANCE]

The volume $V$ of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. The rate of change of the volume with respect to time is $\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}$. We are given that $\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi$ cubic meters per hour and $\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$ meters per hour. We can substitute these values into the equation to solve for $r$.

\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

[ADVANCE]

We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by $4\pi$:

\[
r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
r = \sqrt{5}

So, the radius of the tank is $\sqrt{5}$ meters.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a,
\end{cases}
\]
We need to find the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once.

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the range of the function \( f(x) \). The function has two parts, and we need to consider the range of each part separately.

1. For \( x \geq a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax^2 \). Since \( x \geq a \), the minimum value of \( ax^2 \) occurs at \( x = a \), which gives \( f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \). As \( x \) increases from \( a \) to \( \infty \), \( ax^2 \) increases from \( a^3 \) to \( \infty \). Therefore, the range of \( ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \) is \( [a^3, \infty) \).

2. For \( x < a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). This is a linear function with a slope of \( a \). The value of \( ax + 2a \) approaches \( a^2 + 2a \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left. As \( x \) decreases from \( a \) to \( -\infty \), \( ax + 2a \) decreases from \( a^2 + 2a \) to \( -\infty \) if \( a > 0 \). Therefore, the range of \( ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \) is \( (-\infty, a^2 + 2a) \) if \( a > 0 \).

To ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the range of \( f(x) \) must cover the entire set of real numbers. This means the range of \( ax^2 \) and the range of \( ax + 2a \) must together cover \( (-\infty, \infty) \).

[ADVANCE]

For the ranges to cover the entire set of real numbers, the maximum value of the range of \( ax + 2a \) must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of the range of \( ax^2 \). That is, \( a^2 + 2a \geq a^3 \).

We need to solve the inequality \( a^2 + 2a \geq a^3 \).

Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \( a \), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]

We need to find the intervals where the inequality \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) holds. The roots of the equation \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0 \) are \( a = 0 \), \( a = 2 \), and \( a = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 0) \), \( (0, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \).

Testing a point in each interval, we can determine where the inequality is satisfied. The inequality is satisfied in the intervals \( [-1, 0] \) and \( [2, \infty) \). Since we are looking for the largest value of \( a \), we consider the interval \( [2, \infty) \).

However, we need to check if \( a = 2 \) satisfies the original condition. If \( a = 2 \), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]
The range of \( 2x^2 \) for \( x \geq 2 \) is \( [8, \infty) \), and the range of \( 2x + 4 \) for \( x < 2 \) is \( (-\infty, 8) \). The ranges together cover the entire set of real numbers, so \( a = 2 \) satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the largest value of \( a \) is \( \boxed{2} \).

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1.

To solve this, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). We will complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

[ADVANCE]

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Substituting these back into the original equation, we get:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation is now in standard form, where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\).

Since the radius of the circle is given as 1, we can set up the equation:
\[ \sqrt{34 - c} = 1 \]

[ADVANCE]

To find \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

So, the value of \( c \) for which the circle has a radius of 1 is \( \boxed{33} \).

We are given a function \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \) defined on the interval \( [0,1] \) and we need to find the values of \( \lambda \) in the range \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \) such that there exists an \( x \in [0,1] \) satisfying \( f(x) \neq x \) but \( f(f(x)) = x \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the values of \( \lambda \), we need to analyze the condition \( f(f(x)) = x \). First, let's compute \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We want \( f(f(x)) = x \), so we set up the equation:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This equation is complex, so let's simplify our approach by considering the condition \( f(x) \neq x \). We can start by finding the fixed points of the function \( f(x) \), i.e., the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = x \):
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0. \]
For the second solution, we solve for \( x \):
\[ \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda x = \lambda - 1 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]
So, the fixed points of the function \( f(x) \) are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \). We are interested in the case where \( f(x) \neq x \), so we need to find \( x \) such that \( f(f(x)) = x \) but \( x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the values of \( \lambda \) that satisfy the condition, we can substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) into the equation \( f(f(x)) = x \) and check if it holds. This is because \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is a potential candidate that could satisfy \( f(f(x)) = x \) but \( f(x) \neq x \):
\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}. \]
Now, we substitute \( f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4} \) into \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f\left(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) = f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4}\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \cdot \frac{4 - \lambda}{4} = \frac{\lambda^2(4 - \lambda)}{16}. \]
We want \( f(f(x)) = x \), so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{\lambda^2(4 - \lambda)}{16} = \frac{1}{2}. \]
Multiplying both sides by 16, we get:
\[ \lambda^2(4 - \lambda) = 8. \]
Rearranging the equation, we get a cubic equation:
\[ \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0. \]
We can try to find the roots of this equation. By inspection, we can see that \( \lambda = 2 \) is a root:
\[ 2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0. \]
So, \( \lambda = 2 \) is a solution. We can factor out \( \lambda - 2 \) from the cubic equation:
\[ \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = (\lambda - 2)(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4) = 0. \]
The quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4 = 0 \) can be solved using the quadratic formula:
\[ \lambda = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}. \]
Since \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \), the only valid solution from the quadratic equation is \( \lambda = 1 + \sqrt{5} \), but we need to check if it is within the range. We know that \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \), so \( 1 + \sqrt{5} \approx 3.236 \), which is within the range \( 0 \le \lambda \le 4 \).

Therefore, the values of \( \lambda \) that satisfy the condition are \( \lambda = 2 \) and \( \lambda = 1 + \sqrt{5} \).

Then, \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \cos \phi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]
The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[VERIFY]

We need to verify that the maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) can indeed be achieved within the given constraints. Since \( \theta, \phi \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \), the sum \( \theta + \phi \) can range from \( -\pi \) to \( \pi \). Therefore, \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \) is a valid possibility.

When \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \), we have \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \). Then, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \). We need to check if these values of \( x \) and \( y \) satisfy the original constraints \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), which they do.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that achieve the maximum value. When \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \), we have \( f(x,y) = 1 \). Therefore, the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) \) is \( \boxed{1} \).

The area of the triangle $OAB$ can be calculated using the formula:
\[

where $\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}$ is the cross product of vectors $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$.

Now, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product $\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}$:

We are given that $z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. We need to find $z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote $z + \frac{1}{z} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. We recognize that $a$ is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation $a^2 = a + 1$. We can use this to find higher powers of $a$.

Next, we need to find a relationship between the powers of $z$ and the powers of $a$. We start by calculating $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$:
\[
\left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)^2 = z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 = a + 1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 1 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
So,
\[
z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Next, we calculate $z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3}$ using the identity $\left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)^3 = z^3 + 3\left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right) + \frac{1}{z^3}$:
\[
\left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)^3 = z^3 + 3\left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right) + \frac{1}{z^3} = a^3 = a \cdot a^2 = a(a + 1) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} + 3\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{8 + 4\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 + \sqrt{5}.
\]
So,
\[
z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = 2 + \sqrt{5} - 3 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{4 + 2\sqrt{5} - 3 - 3\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

We observe that the values of $z + \frac{1}{z}$, $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$, and $z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3}$ form a pattern related to the Fibonacci sequence. We can use the recurrence relation to find higher powers.

Next, we calculate $z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4}$ using the identity $\left(z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\right)^2 = z^4 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^4}$:
\[
\left(z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\right)^2 = z^4 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
So,
\[
z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

We can continue this process to find $z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5}$, $z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6}$, and so on, but it's more efficient to recognize the periodicity in the sequence. We notice that the sequence $z^n + \frac{1}{z^n}$ is periodic with a period of 6, as the values of $z^n + \frac{1}{z^n}$ repeat every 6 terms.

Since $85 \mod 6 = 1$, we have:
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.

[ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. The line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ will create a smaller triangle $AMN$ that is similar to triangle $ABC$ with a ratio of 2:3 (since $G$ is 2/3 of the way from $A$ to the midpoint of $BC$).

The area of triangle $AMN$ will be \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle $ABC$. Therefore, the area of triangle $AMN$ is \(\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64\).

Since $G$ is the centroid, the area of triangle $AGN$ is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle $ACG$, and the area of triangle $ACG$ is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle $ABC\). Therefore, the area of triangle $AGN$ is \(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16\).

The area of triangle $ENG$ is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the area of triangle $AGN\) because $G$ is the midpoint of the median $AN$ in triangle $AMN$. Therefore, the area of triangle $ENG$ is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8\).

Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence as \(a\) and the common difference as \(d\). The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

We are given:
\[a_4 = a + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a + 7d = 500\]

We can solve these two equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(d\).

[ADVANCE]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \(a\):
\[(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

To find the common divisors of 100 and 150, we first need to determine their greatest common divisor (GCD). The prime factorization of 100 is $2^2 \cdot 5^2$ and the prime factorization of 150 is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$. The GCD of 100 and 150 is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors, which is $2 \cdot 5^2 = 50$.

Therefore, we can write \( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn} \), which implies \( mn = 24 \).

We need to find all pairs of positive integers \( (m, n) \) such that \( mn = 24 \) and \( n > 1 \). The factors of 24 are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \).

To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers is even, we need to consider the cases where the sum of two numbers is even. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.

1. Both Paul and Jesse select an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse select an odd number.

There is only one even number (2), so the number of ways both can select an even number is $1 \times 1 = 1$.

There are five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, and 13), so the number of ways both can select an odd number is $5 \times 5 = 25$.

[ADVANCE]

1. Since the number must be divisible by $2$, its last digit must be $0$.
2. To be divisible by $3^2 = 9$, the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9. Given that the digits can only be 0 or 1, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9, which means the number must have at least 9 ones.
3. To be divisible by $5^2 = 25$, the number must end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00.

Combining these conditions, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 11111111100, but we need to verify if this number is indeed divisible by 450.

[VERIFY]

To verify, we need to check if 11111111100 is divisible by 450. We can do this by checking its divisibility by 2, 9, and 25.

- Divisibility by 2: The number ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.

Since 11111111100 is divisible by 2, 9, and 25, it is indeed divisible by 450.

We will iterate over all possible combinations of columns and rows to count the number of dark squares. The columns can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, and the rows can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. We need to map the remainders to the corresponding columns and rows.

The mapping for the columns is:

We will count the number of dark squares by iterating over all possible combinations of columns and rows. A square is dark if the sum of its column and row indices is odd.

Next, we will calculate the probability by dividing the number of dark squares by the total number of possible outcomes.

[ADVANCE]

We will calculate the number of dark squares. There are 8 columns and 8 rows, so there are a total of $8 \times 8 = 64$ possible outcomes.

To count the number of dark squares, we note that half of the squares on a standard chessboard are dark. Therefore, the number of dark squares is $\frac{64}{2} = 32$.

The probability of the chess piece landing on a dark square is the number of dark squares divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is $\frac{32}{64} = \frac{1}{2}$.

However, we need to consider the specific mappings of the remainders to the columns and rows. The remainders for the columns are 1, 2, 3, and the remainders for the rows are 1, 2, 3, 4. We need to map these remainders to the corresponding columns and rows and count the number of dark squares.

The columns corresponding to the remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and the rows corresponding to the remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. We will count the number of dark squares by iterating over all possible combinations of these columns and rows.

- Row remainder 2: Row 2, 6
- Row remainder 3: Row 3, 7
- Row remainder 4: Row 4, 8

We will count the number of dark squares:
- For column 1 (remainder 1), the dark squares are (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8) = 8 dark squares
- For column 2 (remainder 2), the dark squares are (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (2,7), (6,1), (6,3), (6,5), (6,7) = 8 dark squares
- For column 3 (remainder 3), the dark squares are (3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (3,8), (7,2), (7,4), (7,6), (7,8) = 8 dark squares
- For column 4 (remainder 4), the dark squares are (4,1), (4,3), (4,5), (4,7), (8,1), (8,3), (8,5), (8,7) = 8 dark squares

The total number of dark squares is $8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32$.

However, we need to consider the probability of each remainder occurring. The probability of each remainder occurring is $\frac{1}{4}$ for the column remainders and $\frac{1}{5}$ for the row remainders.

The total probability is the number of dark squares divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is $\frac{32}{4 \times 5 \times 4 \times 8} = \frac{32}{160} = \frac{1}{5}$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem involves determining the probability of a chess piece landing on a dark square after a random selection of a column and a row on a chessboard. The column is determined by the remainder when the first number is divided by 4, and the row is determined by the remainder when the second number is divided by 5.

After mapping the remainders to the corresponding columns and rows, we counted the number of dark squares and calculated the probability. The total number of dark squares is 32, and the total number of possible outcomes is $4 \times 5 \times 4 \times 8 = 160$.

The probability of the chess piece landing on a dark square is $\frac{32}{160} = \frac{1}{5}$.

The problem asks for the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$. To solve this, we need to first simplify the fraction so that its denominator is in the form of $10^k = 2^k \cdot 5^k$, which will allow us to express the fraction as a finite decimal.

[ADVANCE]

The denominator $5^7 \cdot 2^8$ can be rewritten as $5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2$. To make the denominator a power of 10, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $5$, which will give us:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321 \cdot 5}{5^7 \cdot 2^8 \cdot 5} = \frac{21605}{5^8 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{21605}{10^8}.
\]
This fraction can be expressed as a decimal by dividing the numerator by $10^8$, which is equivalent to moving the decimal point in $21605$ eight places to the left:
\[
\frac{21605}{10^8} = 0.00021605.
\]
[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation $0.00021605$. The digits are $0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5$. We can calculate the sum of these digits:
\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to rewrite the expression:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression can be rewritten as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2.
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. So, we can substitute this value into the expression:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2.
\]
Next, we can use the identity $\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x-y) - \cos (x+y)]$ to simplify the product $(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2$. However, it might be more efficient to use the identity for the product of sines directly.

We can use the identity:
\[
\sin x \sin 2x \sin 4x = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
By setting $x = 20^\circ$, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Since $\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ$, we can rewrite the original product as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) and \(\theta\) represent the radial distance and angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, respectively, and \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height above the \(xy\)-plane is constant, regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This means that for any value of \(r\) and \(\theta\), the \(z\)-coordinate is the same.

Given that \(z\) is constant and can take any value for \(r\) and \(\theta\), the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane.

We are also given the cross product of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ as $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$. We need to find the smallest possible angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.

Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{2 \cdot 7} = \frac{1}{2}.

We are given a function $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ and a new function $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. This means that $g(x)$ is a horizontal shift of the function $f(x)$ by 5 units to the left. The roots of $g(x)$ are therefore the roots of $f(x)$ shifted 5 units to the left.

Let's denote the roots of $f(x)$ as $r_1, r_2, r_3$. Then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term with the opposite sign, which is $49$.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34$.

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.

We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to proceed.

We can use the identity \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ.

So the expression becomes:

We need to find the sum of the squares of the tangents of these angles.

We can use the identity for the sum of squares of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. For angles \(10^\circ\), \(50^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), which are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of \(40^\circ\), we can use the known result:

\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

The problem involves finding the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is $1070^\circ$. We need to use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$. The sum of all interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ$. Since the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^\circ$, the measure of the remaining angle is $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ - 1070^\circ$. Since this is an interior angle of a convex polygon, its measure must be less than $180^\circ$. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
\]

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
\]

\[
180n - 360 < 1250
\]

\[
180n < 1610
\]

\[
n < \frac{1610}{180}
\]

\[
n < 8.9444
\]

Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \leq 8$. Now, we also know that the sum of all interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ$, and this sum must be greater than $1070^\circ$:

\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ > 1070^\circ
\]

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

\[
180n - 360 > 1070
\]

\[
180n > 1430
\]

\[
n > \frac{1430}{180}
\]

\[
n > 7.9444
\]

Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \geq 8$. Combining the two inequalities, we get:

\[
8 \leq n \leq 8

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is $n = 8$.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the congruence as:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves solving the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). We need to find all possible values of \(x\) that satisfy this equation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}\) is \(\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\), we can simplify the expression inside the sine function.

For \(x > 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

For \(x < 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

However, we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x\). Therefore, we can simplify the expression as:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute this into the original equation:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have:
\[
1 = \frac{1}{3},
\]
which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption about the range of \(x\) might be incorrect, or there might be another approach to solve the equation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's re-evaluate the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) by using the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\). We can let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), then \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
\sin \left( \theta + \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Again, we have a contradiction since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\).

However, we can use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) \cos \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) + \cos \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) \sin \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right).
\]
We know that \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), \(\cos \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), \(\cos \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^2}} = \frac{|x|}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\), and \(\sin \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\sqrt{1+\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\).

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{|x|}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x|x| + 1}{x^2+1} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
We need to consider two cases: \(x \geq 0\) and \(x < 0\).

For \(x \geq 0\), \(|x| = x\), so the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2+1} = \frac{1}{3},
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
1 = \frac{1}{3},
\]
a contradiction.

For \(x < 0\), \(|x| = -x\), so the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{-x^2 + 1}{x^2+1} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(3(x^2+1)\), we get:
\[
-3x^2 + 3 = x^2 + 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
-4x^2 = -2,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
x^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]
Since \(x < 0\), we have:
\[
x = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.

We are given two lines in vector form, and we need to find the distance between them. The first line is defined by \[\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},\] and the second line is defined by \[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.\] We are told that these lines are parallel.

To find the distance between two parallel lines, we can use the formula:
\[d = \frac{|\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}|}{|\mathbf{d}|},\]
where $\mathbf{PQ}$ is the vector between a point on each line, and $\mathbf{d}$ is the direction vector of the lines.

[ADVANCE]

We can choose a point on each line. Let's take $\mathbf{P} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ from the first line and $\mathbf{Q} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$ from the second line. The vector $\mathbf{PQ}$ is given by:
\[\mathbf{PQ} = \mathbf{Q} - \mathbf{P} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]

The direction vector $\mathbf{d}$ of the lines is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ (or equivalently $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$, but we will use the first one for simplicity).

Next, we need to find the cross product $\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}$:
\[\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2) = \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Now, we need to find the magnitude of $\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}$:
\[|\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.\]

We also need to find the magnitude of the direction vector $\mathbf{d}$:
\[|\mathbf{d}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.\]

Finally, we can find the distance between the two lines:
\[d = \frac{|\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}|}{|\mathbf{d}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.\]

The rectangle's width is the distance between $x = -5$ and $x = 5$, which is $10$ units, and its height is the distance between $y = -4$ and $y = 4$, which is $8$ units. However, we are interested in the points that lie completely inside the rectangle, so we need to exclude the boundary points.

We are given the cross products of vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, and we need to find the cross product of the vectors $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})$ and $(3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the distributive property of the cross product to expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$. The distributive property states that for any vectors $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{w}$, and scalar $k$, we have:
\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}
\]
and
\[
(k\mathbf{u}) \times \mathbf{v} = k(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}).
\]
Using these properties, we can expand the given expression as follows:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

\[
(-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
\[
(-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0},
\]
since the cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector.

Now, we can substitute the given values of the cross products:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get:

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, we can deduce that $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle ADC$ by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) congruence criterion. This is because $\angle BAC = \angle CAD$, $\angle ACB = \angle ACD = 90^\circ$, and $\overline{AC}$ is a common side.

Since the triangles are congruent, their areas are equal. Let the area of $\triangle ACD$ be $x$. Then the area of $\triangle ABC$ is also $x$. The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$, which is $x + x = 2x$. We are given that the area of the trapezoid is 42, so we can set up the equation:
\[2x = 42.\]

The problem is to solve for \( x \) in the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To solve for \( x \), we can start by squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[

Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

Rearranging the terms gives:

\[
8x - 27x = -9

\[

Next action: [VERIFY]
We need to ensure that the solution \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) satisfies the original equation and that the steps taken are valid. We also need to check that the expression inside the square roots is non-negative.

Substituting \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27-19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

The solution \( x = \frac{9}{19} \) satisfies the original equation. Additionally, we need to check that the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative:

\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} > 0

\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - 1 = \frac{27-19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0

The problem involves selecting four points, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle and finding the probability that the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of cyclic order. When four points are chosen on a circle, the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating order, i.e., the points are ordered as $A, C, B, D$ or $A, D, B, C$ in terms of their position on the circle.

The total number of ways to arrange four points on a circle is the same as the number of ways to arrange four points in a linear order, which is $4! = 24$. However, since the order is cyclic, we need to consider the distinct arrangements of the points.

For any selection of four points, there are exactly 3 ways to pair them into two line segments, and only one of these pairings will result in intersecting line segments. This is because the points can be paired in 3 different ways: $(AB, CD)$, $(AC, BD)$, and $(AD, BC)$. Only one of these pairings, $(AC, BD)$ or $(AD, BC)$, will have the line segments intersecting.

Therefore, the probability that the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there are 3 ways to pair the points and only 1 of them results in intersecting line segments, the probability is $\frac{1}{3}$.

However, we need to consider the correct calculation. The correct way to think about it is that for any selection of four points, the probability that the line segments intersect is the probability that the points are in an alternating order. This can be calculated by considering the number of ways to choose the positions of the points.

The correct probability can be calculated as follows: for any selection of four points, the first point can be placed anywhere on the circle. The second point can be placed anywhere on the circle, but the third point must be placed in one of the two arcs created by the first two points, and the fourth point must be placed in the remaining arc for the segments to intersect. This gives a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$.

So, the probability that the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

The problem involves finding the measure of angle $\angle ADC$ in a diagram with two circles, one with radius 1 and the other with radius 2, both centered at $D$. The shaded area is related to the areas of the circles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
The area of the larger circle is $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$. The area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, which is $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.

The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle. Let the measure of angle $\angle ADC$ be $\theta$ (in radians). The area of the sector of the larger circle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 \cdot \theta = 2\theta$, and the area of the sector of the smaller circle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta$.

The area of the shaded region is the difference between these two sector areas: $2\theta - \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{3}{2}\theta$. We know this area is equal to $\frac{5\pi}{3}$, so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Solving for $\theta$, we get:
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{9}
\]
Since the problem asks for the measure of angle $\angle ADC$ in degrees, we convert $\theta$ from radians to degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = 200^\circ
\]
However, the problem specifies the angle is the smaller angle, so we need to find the smaller angle corresponding to $\angle ADC$. Since the full circle is $360^\circ$, the smaller angle is:
\[
360^\circ - 200^\circ = 160^\circ
\]
But we need to verify if this is the correct smaller angle in the context of the problem.

Next action: [VERIFY]
We need to verify that the calculated angle is indeed the smaller angle in the context of the problem. Given the setup of the problem, the angle $\angle ADC$ should be the smaller angle formed by the radii to the points where the circles intersect the shaded region. The calculated angle of $160^\circ$ seems reasonable given the shaded area is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the larger circle's area, which indicates a relatively large sector.

However, we should also consider the possibility of an alternative solution or a different interpretation of the angle. Given the symmetry and the nature of the problem, the calculated angle appears to be correct.

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. Substituting the given values:

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical glasses are required to fill the spherical container. This can be found by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We can find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\) using the Pythagorean identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\).

So, \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine: \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta\) and \(\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta\).

So, \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}\).

And, \(\sin (\alpha - \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}\).

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta)\):

\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{21})^2}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -\frac{9}{100}.

The problem requires us to find the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from the 14 members, and then subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats.

The total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Democrats:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

[ADVANCE]

We can apply the difference of squares formula to the given expression:
\[513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487).\]

Now, we can calculate the values inside the parentheses:
\[513 - 487 = 26,\]
\[513 + 487 = 1000.\]

We are given that the product of three consecutive integers is 120. Let's denote these integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]
We are also given that the product divided by the average of these three numbers is 24. The average of the three numbers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]
So, the second condition can be written as:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]
This further simplifies to:
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]
So:
\[
n^2 = 25
\]
This gives us two possible values for \(n\):
\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]
We need to check which of these values satisfy the original equation \((n-1)n(n+1) = 120\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's check both values of \(n\):

1. If \(n = 5\), the three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\). We can calculate their product:
\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120

This satisfies the first condition.

2. If \(n = -5\), the three consecutive integers are \(-6, -5, -4\). We can calculate their product:
\[
(-6) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-4) = -120

This does not satisfy the first condition.

So, the only valid solution is \(n = 5\), and the three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\). The largest of these integers is 6.

The problem requires finding the positive value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -4092$.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Since the problem specifies that $x$ is a positive value, we discard the negative solution.

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} - 2 \pi \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

So the expression becomes \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\) to simplify the expression. Let's multiply and divide the expression by \(\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)\) to use the double-angle identity for sine.

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity \(\sin (2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \sin \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity again:

Since \(\sin (\pi + x) = -\sin x\) and \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} (-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)) (-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right))}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{16}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\), then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and the properties of the isosceles triangle to find the relationship between the sides.

Since \(D\) lies on \(AM\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). We can use trigonometric relationships in the triangle to find the length of the sides.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the tangent function to relate the angles and the sides of the triangle. Consider \(\triangle BDM\) and \(\triangle BMA\):
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{BM}{1} = BM
\]
\[
\tan \angle BMA = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11}
\]
Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we have \(\angle BDM = 3\theta - \angle MDC = 3\theta - (90^\circ - \theta) = 4\theta - 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\tan \angle BDM = \tan (4\theta - 90^\circ) = -\cot 4\theta\).

We also know that \(\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{BM}{11}\). Using the triple angle formula for tangent, we can express \(\tan 3\theta\) in terms of \(\tan \theta\):
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}
\]
Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we have \(\tan \angle BDC = \tan 3\theta\). We can use the fact that \(\tan \angle BDM = -\cot 4\theta\) and the relationship between \(\angle BDM\) and \(\angle BDC\) to find \(\theta\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that \(\tan \angle BDM = BM\) and \(\tan \angle BMA = \frac{BM}{11}\) to find the relationship between \(\theta\) and \(BM\). Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we can use the tangent triple angle formula to find \(\theta\).

Let's denote \(BM = x\). Then, \(\tan \theta = \frac{x}{11}\). We can use the fact that \(\tan \angle BDM = BM = x\) and the relationship between \(\angle BDM\) and \(\angle BDC\) to find \(\theta\).

Using the tangent triple angle formula, we have:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{x}{11} - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2}

After solving the equation, we can find the value of \(x\). Then, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(AB\) and \(AC\).

Let's solve the equation:
\[
x = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{x}{11} - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(1 - 3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2\), we get:
\[
x \left(1 - 3\left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2\right) = \frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
x - \frac{3x^3}{121} = \frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 1331, we get:
\[
1331x - \frac{3993x^3}{121} = 363x - x^3
\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[
1331x - 33x^3 = 363x - x^3
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
968x = 32x^3
\]
Dividing both sides by \(32x\), we get:
\[
30.5 = x^2
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
x = \sqrt{30.5} = \sqrt{\frac{61}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{122}}{2}
\]
Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(AB\):
\[
AB = \sqrt{BM^2 + AM^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{122}}{2}\right)^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{\frac{122}{4} + 121} = \sqrt{\frac{122 + 484}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{606}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{303}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{606}}{2}

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + 2BM = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{606}}{2} + 2 \cdot \sqrt{30.5} = \sqrt{606} + \sqrt{122} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 303} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 61} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{303} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{61} = \sqrt{2} (\sqrt{303} + \sqrt{61})

However, we can simplify this further by checking the answer choices.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that \(AB = AC\) and the altitude \(AM = 11\) to find the length of \(AB\) and \(AC\). We can also use the relationship between the sides of the triangle to find the perimeter.

\[
y^2 = BM^2 + AM^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{122}}{2}\right)^2 + 11^2 = \frac{122}{4} + 121 = \frac{122 + 484}{4} = \frac{606}{4} = \frac{303}{2}

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first integer in the sequence as $x$. Since the integers are consecutive, the sequence can be written as $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) \(\times\) (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum is $3^7$, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the first and last term is $\frac{x + (x+26)}{2} = x+13$.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 3^7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 3^7 \]
\[ 3^3(x+13) = 3^7 \]
\[ x+13 = 3^4 \]
\[ x+13 = 81 \]
\[ x = 68 \]

The sequence of integers is $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$. Since there are 27 terms (an odd number), the median is the 14th term in the sequence, which is also the middle term.

The problem requires finding the values of the real number $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds true. We need to break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

[ADVANCE]
First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. To solve this, we can make a substitution, say $y = x^2$, which transforms the inequality into $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factorize the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. This inequality holds when $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we have $-7 < x^2 < 3$. Because $x^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$, the inequality simplifies to $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which is equivalent to $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, we consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$, which factors into $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $x^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$, the expression $x^2 + 2 \geq 2 > 0$ for all real $x$, and thus $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ is true for all real $x$ except when $x^2 + 2 = 0$, which has no real solutions. Therefore, the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$ holds for all real numbers $x$.

[SYNTHESIZE]
Combining the solutions from both inequalities, we find that the solution to the compound inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ is the intersection of the solutions to the individual inequalities. The inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$ holds for all real $x$, and the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds for $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the solution to the compound inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,$ we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that:
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z,$ $p = xy + yz + zx,$ and $q = xyz = 4.$ We can rewrite the above equation as:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p),$ we get:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relation involving $s$ and $p.$ We can rewrite the third equation as:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Given that $xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12$ and $xyz = 4,$ we have:
\[12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to:
\[12 = sp - 12,\]
so:
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\]
\[sp = 24.\]
We can express $p$ in terms of $s$ from the second equation:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
So, we have:
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which simplifies to:
\[s^3 = 64,\]
so:
\[s = 4.\]
Now, we can find $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s} = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $\boxed{6}.$

We are given a table showing the percentage of male and female students using the bus in a survey of high school students. We need to determine for which grade the number of male students using the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of female students using the bus.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the number of male students using the bus as $M$ and the number of female students using the bus as $F$. We are given that there are 300 male students and 300 female students in each grade. We need to find the grade for which $M$ is closest to $135\%$ of $F$, i.e., $M \approx 1.35F$.

We will calculate the number of male and female students using the bus for each grade and then check which grade satisfies the condition.

For the $9^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade:
- Number of male students using the bus = $41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3$
- Number of female students using the bus = $39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2$
- We check if $123.3 \approx 1.35 \times 118.2$: $1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.47$, which is not close to 123.3.

For the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade:
- Number of male students using the bus = $34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2$
- Number of female students using the bus = $33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3$
- We check if $103.2 \approx 1.35 \times 99.3$: $1.35 \times 99.3 = 134.055$, which is close to 103.2.

For the $11^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade:
- Number of male students using the bus = $20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8$
- Number of female students using the bus = $13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4$
- We check if $61.8 \approx 1.35 \times 41.4$: $1.35 \times 41.4 = 56.39$, which is not close to 61.8.

For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade:
- Number of male students using the bus = $11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8$
- Number of female students using the bus = $8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8$
- We check if $34.8 \approx 1.35 \times 25.8$: $1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.83$, which is very close to 34.8.

[SYNTHESIZE]

From the calculations, we see that the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade has the number of male students using the bus closest to $135\%$ of the number of female students using the bus.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator can be written as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\), and the denominator can be factored as \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\).

The inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator and when the numerator is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These values divide the real number line into intervals where the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) does not change sign.

The intervals to consider are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We need to test the sign of the expression in each interval.

[ADVANCE]

In the interval \((-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{-10(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{-10(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]

In the interval \((-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{-1(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{-1(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]

In the interval \((0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{1(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]

In the interval \((9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 18\):
\[
\frac{|(18-9)(18+9)|}{18(18-36)} = \frac{|(9)(27)|}{18(-18)} = \frac{243}{-324} < 0.
\]

In the interval \((36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
\[
\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{40(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{40(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0.
\]

From the sign analysis, the expression is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

However, we must exclude the values \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) because they make the denominator zero.

Also, \(x = 9\) makes the numerator zero, so it does not satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

[OUTPUT]

The solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

The problem involves finding the maximum area of a rectangular field within a running track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as $L$ and the width as $W$. The two semicircles together form a full circle with radius $W/2$. The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle: $2L + 2\pi(W/2) = 400$. This simplifies to $2L + \pi W = 400$.

We need to express the area of the rectangle, $A = L \cdot W$, in terms of one variable to maximize it. We can solve the perimeter equation for $L$: $L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}$.

Substituting this expression for $L$ into the area formula gives us $A = \left(\frac{400 - \pi W}{2}\right)W = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}$.

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $W$ and set it to zero: $\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0$. Solving for $W$, we get $W = \frac{200}{\pi}$.

Now, we need to find the corresponding value of $L$: $L = \frac{400 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100$.

The maximum area is $A = L \cdot W = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}$.

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ and $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows: $RS = a$, $ST = b$, and $RT = c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse.

Given $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$, we can write:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{b}{c} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This implies that $b = 2k$ and $c = 5k$ for some positive constant $k$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the side $RS$:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \implies a^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2 \implies a^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2 \implies a^2 = 21k^2 \implies a = \sqrt{21}k
\]

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, $\sin T = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{b}{c}$. However, we can also use the fact that $\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{a}{c}$. Substituting the values we found:
\[
\sin T = \frac{a}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{21}k}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of $\sin T$ is $\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The problem asks for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. We need to express this distance in the form $\sqrt{a}/b$ and find the sum $a+b$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any integer.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The distance $D$ between the origin $(0,0)$ and a point $(x,y)$ on the graph is given by the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
Since the point $(x,y)$ lies on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$, we can substitute $y$ in the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^2-3\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9\right)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's define:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
We can find the critical points by taking the derivative of $f(x)$ and setting it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
This gives us the critical points $x = 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$, and $x = -\sqrt{2}$. We can evaluate $f(x)$ at these points to find the minimum value:
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, so the minimum distance is:
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The distance is in the form $\sqrt{a}/b$ where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3-x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3+2x^2+3x & \text{if } x>3.

We will first find \( f^{-1}(0) \) and then \( f^{-1}(6) \).

**Step 1: Find \( f^{-1}(0) \)**

For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). To find \( f^{-1}(0) \), we set \( 3 - x = 0 \) and solve for \( x \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). To find \( f^{-1}(6) \), we set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \) and solve for \( x \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
We can try to find the root of this polynomial equation. By inspection, we can see that \( x = 2 \) is not a solution since \( 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). We can try \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 4 \) to see if either of them is a solution. Let's check \( x = 4 \):
\[ -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 - 6 = -64 + 32 + 12 - 6 = -26 \neq 0. \]

The problem involves comparing the accelerations of two objects (a soft ball and a baseball) given that the same force is applied to each of them. We need to use Newton's second law, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), or \( F = ma \).

Given:
- Mass of the soft ball, \( m_1 = 200 \) grams
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_2 = 150 \) grams
- The same force is applied to both objects, so \( F_1 = F_2 \)

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball, \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Since the force applied to both objects is the same, we can set up the equation:
\[ F_1 = m_1 a_1 \]
\[ F_2 = m_2 a_2 \]
Since \( F_1 = F_2 \), we can equate the two expressions:
\[ m_1 a_1 = m_2 a_2 \]
We can rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio of the accelerations:
\[ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1} \]
Substituting the given masses:
\[ \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

[OUTPUT]

The ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the baseball is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}\).

We need to find the number of common digits in the representation of the decimal number $629_{10}$ in base 7 and base 8.

First, we will convert the decimal number $629_{10}$ to its equivalent in base 7 and base 8.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
\begin{aligned}
629 \div 7 &= 89 \text{ remainder } 6 \\
89 \div 7 &= 12 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
12 \div 7 &= 1 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
1 \div 7 &= 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the representation of $629_{10}$ in base 7 is $1556_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 8, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
\begin{aligned}
629 \div 8 &= 78 \text{ remainder } 5 \\
78 \div 8 &= 9 \text{ remainder } 6 \\
9 \div 8 &= 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \\

So, the representation of $629_{10}$ in base 8 is $1165_8$.

Now, we need to find the common digits between the base 7 representation $1556_7$ and the base 8 representation $1165_8$. We will compare the digits of the two representations:

- The digits in $1556_7$ are 1, 5, 5, 6.
- The digits in $1165_8$ are 1, 1, 6, 5.

The problem involves determining the number of handshakes that occur at a magic show where 6 magicians are present. Each magician shakes hands with every other magician, but not with themselves or anyone they don't know. Since all magicians are friends and don't dislike each other, they shake hands with everyone else.

[ADVANCE]

To find the total number of handshakes, we can use the concept of combinations. Since each magician shakes hands with every other magician, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 magicians out of the total 6 magicians. This can be represented as the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the total number of magicians.

The formula for combinations is:
\[ \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]

Substituting \( n = 6 \) into the formula, we get:
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15 \]

So, the total number of handshakes is 15.

[OUTPUT]

The problem requires calculating the number of handshakes among 6 magicians, where each magician shakes hands with every other magician. Using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), we find that the total number of handshakes is \( \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15 \).

Therefore, the number of handshakes that occurred at the magic show is \(\boxed{15}\).

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to find \( g(1) \), which is equivalent to \( f(1-1) = f(0) \).

However, we can also find \( g(1) \) by substituting \( x = 1 \) into the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \). This means we need to evaluate \( f(1-1) = f(0) \).

Now, let's substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

The problem requires finding the shortest distance from the point $(6, 0)$ to the line $y = 2x - 2$. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line equation is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(6, 0)$, so $x_1 = 6$ and $y_1 = 0$. Now, we can substitute these values into the distance formula.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]
To simplify the expression, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:
\[

Next action: [ADVANCE]

By Vieta's formulas for the quartic equation $x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0$, we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.

We are interested in the set of unordered triples of the form $\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}$. Let's denote these expressions as $a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$.

Next, we note that:
\[
a + b + c = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

Thus, we have $a + b + c = 0$.

\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding this product and using the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2$, we can simplify the expression. However, we can also use the fact that the product of the roots taken two at a time is zero to find the value of $abc$.

Since $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2$, we can express $abc$ in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. After some algebraic manipulations, we can find that $abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4$.

Thus, we have $abc = 4$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we have a system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 0,

\[
abc = 4.

We need to find the set of unordered triples $\{a, b, c\}$. Since $a + b + c = 0$, we can express $c$ as $c = -a - b$. Substituting this into the equation $abc = 4$, we get:
\[
ab(-a - b) = 4 \implies -ab(a + b) = 4 \implies ab(a + b) = -4.
\]

This is a symmetric equation, and the solutions for $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be such that they satisfy the symmetry of the original polynomial. By symmetry and the fact that the product of the roots is 4 and their sum is 0, we can deduce that the solutions are $\{2, -1, -1\}$.

Thus, the set of unordered triples is:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices. The perpendicular bisectors of the segments joining the center to the vertices will divide the rectangle into regions, and the point will be closer to the center if it lies within the region formed by the intersection of these bisectors.

The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will form a smaller rectangle with its sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle $ABCD$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the segments joining the center to the vertices.

Let's assume the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle $ABCD$ are $A(-a, b)$, $B(a, b)$, $C(a, -b)$, and $D(-a, -b)$, and the center is at the origin $O(0, 0)$. The midpoint of $OA$ is $(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})$, the midpoint of $OB$ is $(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})$, the midpoint of $OC$ is $(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})$, and the midpoint of $OD$ is $(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})$. The smaller rectangle formed by these midpoints will have vertices at $(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})$, $(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})$, $(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})$, and $(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})$.

The area of the smaller rectangle is $\left(\frac{a}{2} - \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right) \left(\frac{b}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right) = ab$. The area of the original rectangle $ABCD$ is $2a \cdot 2b = 4ab$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to the center than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is $\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):

   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the first part of the definition: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the first part of the definition: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the distance traveled by James, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Here, the diagonal of the rectangular field is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs of 300 feet and 400 feet.

The distance traveled by James is:

Since $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$ and $\omega^3 = 1,$ the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{2 - 1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
However, we should also consider the case when $\omega = 1,$ because in that case, the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$ is not defined. But since $\omega \neq 1$ (because $\omega$ is a non-real cube root of unity), we don't need to consider this case.

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is $\frac{1}{2}.$

[OUTPUT]

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$

"[ASSESS]

The problem asks for the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once.

We need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and find the minimum.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We will calculate the total distance for each possible route:

1. Starting from point $A$:
   - Route $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$: $6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20$
   - Route $A \to B \to D \to C \to A$: $6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19$
   - Route $A \to C \to B \to D \to A$: $6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 19$
   - Route $A \to C \to D \to B \to A$: $6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19$
   - Route $A \to D \to B \to C \to A$: $5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19$
   - Route $A \to D \to C \to B \to A$: $5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20$

2. Starting from point $B$:
   - Route $B \to A \to C \to D \to B$: $6 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 19$
   - Route $B \to A \to D \to C \to B$: $6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20$
   - Route $B \to C \to A \to D \to B$: $5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 18$
   - Route $B \to C \to D \to A \to B$: $5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20$
   - Route $B \to D \to A \to C \to B$: $3 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 19$
   - Route $B \to D \to C \to A \to B$: $3 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 19$

3. Starting from point $C$:
   - Route $C \to A \to B \to D \to C$: $6 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 19$
   - Route $C \to A \to D \to B \to C$: $6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 19$
   - Route $C \to B \to A \to D \to C$: $5 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 19$
   - Route $C \to B \to D \to A \to C$: $5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19$
   - Route $C \to D \to A \to B \to C$: $4 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 20$
   - Route $C \to D \to B \to A \to C$: $4 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 18$

4. Starting from point $D$:
   - Route $D \to A \to B \to C \to D$: $5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 20$
   - Route $D \to A \to C \to B \to D$: $5 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 19$
   - Route $D \to B \to A \to C \to D$: $3 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 18$
   - Route $D \to B \to C \to A \to D$: $3 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 18$
   - Route $D \to C \to A \to B \to D$: $4 + 5 + 6 + 3 = 18$
   - Route $D \to C \to B \to A \to D$: $4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19$

From the calculations above, we can see that the minimum total distance is 18, which occurs for several routes starting from points $B$, $C$, and $D$.

The shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once is $\boxed{18}$.
