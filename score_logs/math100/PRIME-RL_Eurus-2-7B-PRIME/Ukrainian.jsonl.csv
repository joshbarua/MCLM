We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can substitute the given value of $\sin D$ and the length of $EF$ to find the length of $DF$. We have:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that:
\[
DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2
\]
\[
DE^2 + 49 = 100
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given a complex number $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and another complex number $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$ which is the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complex number rotation. The rotation of a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$ can be achieved by the following formula:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]
where $e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$. In this case, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, so $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to calculate $z - c$ first:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \]

Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Finally, we add $c$ to the result to get $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

The problem requires simplifying the square root of 242. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves finding the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table, with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together.

[ADVANCE]

1. Treat the 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) who must sit together as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the 5 remaining individuals plus the block of 3) around a round table.
2. The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, the number of ways to arrange the 6 units around the round table is $(6-1)! = 5!$.
3. Within the block of 3 people, there are $3!$ ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.
4. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the round table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is $5! \times 3!$.

[ADVANCE]

1. Calculate $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.
2. Calculate $3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$.

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
The general term in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\).

Simplifying the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k}(10)^{5-k}(x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k}(10)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k}(10)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]
To find the constant term, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Therefore, we set \(15 - 5k = 0\) and solve for \(k\):
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{3}(10)^{5-3}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3}(10)^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$ and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

We can rewrite $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ as $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}$, since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$.

This simplifies to:
\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, we reduce 8 modulo 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 24 \pmod{7}.

Now, we reduce 24 modulo 7:

The problem involves finding the minimum angle by which a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and its symmetry group is the dihedral group $D_5$, which consists of 5 rotations (including the identity rotation) and 5 reflections.

The rotation angles in this group are multiples of $\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ$. This means the pentagon will return to its original position after a rotation of $72^\circ \times k$, where $k$ is an integer.

To find the minimum angle of rotation, we need to find the smallest positive angle that is a multiple of $72^\circ$.

\nThe problem provides the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram: $(5, 3)$, $(6, 8)$, and $(7, 4)$, with the fourth vertex being $(x, y)$, where $x > 7$. We need to find the value of $x + y$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
[ADVANCE]
In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex $(x, y)$.

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$ is $\left(\frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2}\right)$.
The midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$ is $\left(\frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{13}{2}, 6\right)$.

Since the midpoints are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6

Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8

Solving the second equation for $y$:
\[

[ADVANCE]

We know that $\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ and $\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. This simplifies to $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$.

We also know that $\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$. Using the relationship we found, $\tan A = \frac{2 \cdot \text{adjacent}}{\text{adjacent}} = 2$.

[VERIFY]

We have used the given relationship $\sin A = 2\cos A$ to find $\tan A$. This approach is valid because $\tan A$ is defined as the ratio of $\sin A$ to $\cos A$. We can also verify this by using the identity $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$. Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we have $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A} = 2$.

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and then summing the values of the asymptotes.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression to find its roots.

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

Setting the factored form equal to zero, we get:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), where \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can find the sum of the asymptotes \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Next, we add $99$ to the result:
\[99^2 + 99 = 9801 + 99 = 9900.\]

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901.\]

To approach this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the matrix norm and the vector norm. The matrix norm induced by the vector norm is defined as the maximum ratio of the norm of the transformed vector to the norm of the original vector.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) as \( A \). We want to find the smallest \( C \) such that \(\| A \bold{v} \| \le C \| \bold{v} \|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\).

The matrix norm induced by the Euclidean vector norm is given by the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). So, we need to compute \( A^T A \).

\[ A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \]

Next, we need to find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:

\[ \det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 \]

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\) to find the eigenvalues.

\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2} \]

So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16. Therefore, the matrix norm induced by the Euclidean vector norm is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

[ADVANCE]

The smallest \( C \) such that \(\| A \bold{v} \| \le C \| \bold{v} \|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is the matrix norm of \( A \), which we have found to be 4.

To find the product of the two polynomials $3t^2+5t+a$ and $4t^2+bt-2$, we will use the distributive property to expand the product.

The product is:
\[

Combining like terms, the product becomes:
\[

We are given that this product equals $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can set up the following equations:
\[

\]
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[

\]

[ADVANCE]

From the equation $-2a = 6$, we can solve for $a$:
\[
a = -3

Substituting $a = -3$ into the equation $-10 + ab = -16$, we get:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16
\]
\[
-10 - 3b = -16
\]
\[
-3b = -6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]
We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by substituting them into the other equations. First, we substitute $b = 2$ into the equation $3b + 20 = 26$:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26

This equation holds true. Finally, we substitute $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into the equation $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8

This equation also holds true.

The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. The rate of change of the volume with respect to time is given as \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour. The rate of change of the height with respect to time is given as 4 meters per hour. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) and we need to find the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once.

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

To find the largest value of \( a \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function for both \( x \geq a \) and \( x < a \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of the function. The function \( f(x) \) must cover all possible \( y \)-values.

1. For \( x \geq a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax^2 \). Since \( x \geq a \), the minimum value of \( f(x) \) in this region occurs at \( x = a \), which gives \( f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \). As \( x \) increases, \( f(x) = ax^2 \) increases without bound.

2. For \( x < a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). This is a linear function, and its range depends on the value of \( a \). The maximum value of \( f(x) \) in this region occurs as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left, which gives \( f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a \). As \( x \) decreases, \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) decreases without bound.

To ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the range of the function must cover all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of the quadratic part \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \) should be less than or equal to the maximum value of the linear part \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \).

Therefore, we need to find the largest value of \( a \) such that \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We need to solve the inequality \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \).

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]

Factoring out \( a \), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]

Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]

To solve this inequality, we need to find the intervals where the expression \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \) is less than or equal to zero. The critical points are \( a = -1, 0, 2 \).

We can test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 0) \), \( (0, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \).

- For \( a < -1 \), the expression \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \) is negative (since \( a < 0 \), \( a - 2 < 0 \), and \( a + 1 < 0 \), the product of three negative numbers is negative).
- For \( -1 < a < 0 \), the expression \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \) is positive (since \( a < 0 \), \( a - 2 < 0 \), and \( a + 1 > 0 \), the product of two negative numbers and one positive number is positive).
- For \( 0 < a < 2 \), the expression \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \) is negative (since \( a > 0 \), \( a - 2 < 0 \), and \( a + 1 > 0 \), the product of one positive number and two negative numbers is negative).
- For \( a > 2 \), the expression \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \) is positive (since \( a > 0 \), \( a - 2 > 0 \), and \( a + 1 > 0 \), the product of three positive numbers is positive).

The inequality \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) is satisfied in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1] \), \( [0, 2] \).

Since \( a \) is a number that we are looking for, and we are asked to find the largest value of \( a \), we consider the interval \( [0, 2] \). The largest value of \( a \) in this interval is \( 2 \).

Therefore, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \( \boxed{2} \).

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the given equation of the circle represents a circle with a radius of 1. The equation of the circle is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \).

To find the value of \( c \), we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

[ADVANCE]

To rewrite the equation in standard form, we need to complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

1. Rearrange the equation: \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -c \).
2. Complete the square for the \( x \) terms: \( x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).
3. Complete the square for the \( y \) terms: \( y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).
4. Substitute the completed squares back into the equation: \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = -c \).
5. Simplify the equation: \( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 = -c \).
6. Rearrange to get the standard form: \( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \).

Since the radius of the circle is given as 1, we can set \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we have \( 34 - c = 1 \).

Now, solve for \( c \):

To find the value of \( \lambda \), we need to calculate \( f(f(x)) \) and set it equal to \( x \). First, let's find \( f(f(x)) \):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We are given that \( f(f(x)) = x \), so we can set up the equation:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This equation is complex, so let's simplify it step by step.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote \( y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \). Then, the equation \( f(f(x)) = x \) becomes \( f(y) = x \), which means:
\[ \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]
Substituting back \( y = \lambda x(1 - x) \), we get:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
Expanding the left-hand side, we have:
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0. \]
Factoring out \( x \), we obtain:
\[ x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0. \]
This equation has two possible solutions: \( x = 0 \) or \( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0 \).

If \( x = 0 \), then \( f(x) = 0 \), which means \( f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0 \). This solution corresponds to the fixed point of the function, and we are looking for a solution where \( f(x) \neq x \). Therefore, we discard \( x = 0 \) as a solution.

Now, we consider the equation:
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0. \]
We need to find the value of \( \lambda \) that satisfies this equation for some \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \).

To find the value of \( \lambda \), let's consider the case when \( x = 1 \). Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the equation \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \), we get:
\[ f(1) = \lambda \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0. \]
Then, \( f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0 \), which does not satisfy the condition \( f(f(x)) = x \) for \( x = 1 \). Therefore, \( x = 1 \) is not a solution.

Now, let's consider the case when \( f(x) = x \). We have:
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]
This equation has two solutions: \( x = 0 \) or \( \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \). We already know that \( x = 0 \) is not the solution we are looking for. Solving for the second solution, we get:
\[ \lambda x = \lambda - 1, \]
\[ x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]
Since \( x \in [0,1] \), we need \( 0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \). This inequality holds when \( \lambda \geq 1 \).

Simplifying the terms, we have:
\[ \lambda^2 \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - (\lambda - 1) + \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ \lambda \left(1 - \lambda + 1 + \frac{\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = 0, \]

The problem requires finding the smallest positive angle $\theta$ such that $\tan \theta$ is equal to a given expression involving trigonometric functions of various angles.

[ADVANCE]

We start by simplifying the given expression for $\tan \theta$. The expression is:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the numerator and the denominator.

[ADVANCE]

The numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).
\]
Applying this formula, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identity for cosine, we have:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).
\]
Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten using the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B).
\]
Applying this formula, we get:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin (-15^\circ) = -\sin 15^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (35^\circ - 50^\circ) = \sin (-15^\circ) = -\sin 15^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
-\sin 15^\circ - \sin 15^\circ = -2 \sin 15^\circ.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the expression for $\tan \theta$ as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-2 \sin 15^\circ} = -\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{2 \sin 15^\circ}.
\]

[ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x$ to rewrite $\cos 55^\circ$ as $\sin 35^\circ$. So, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{2 \sin 15^\circ}.
\]

We can use the identity $\sin (30^\circ + x) = \sin 30^\circ \cos x + \cos 30^\circ \sin x$ to expand $\sin 35^\circ$:
\[
\sin 35^\circ = \sin (30^\circ + 5^\circ) = \sin 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ + \cos 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ.
\]
Substituting this into the expression for $\tan \theta$, we get:
\[
\tan \theta = -\frac{\sqrt{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ \right)}{2 \sin 15^\circ} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left( \cos 5^\circ + \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ \right) \frac{1}{\sin 15^\circ}.
\]

We can simplify this expression further by using the identity for the sine of a sum of angles. However, we can also recognize that the expression might be simplified using known angle values or identities.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the known values of $\sin 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}$ and try to simplify the expression. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression can be simplified to a known angle value.

After re-evaluating the expression, we can find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 80^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the smallest positive angle $\theta$ is:
\[
\theta = 80^\circ.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80^\circ}.

n = 7, \quad n_E = 3, \quad n_L = 1, \quad n_P = 1, \quad n_S = 1, \quad n_I = 1

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let's set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

So, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \). We can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

Given $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, we can calculate the cross product:

\[ z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = a \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) - \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) = a(-2) - (-a) = -2a + a = -a. \]

We observe that \( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = -a \) and \( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = -2 \). This suggests a periodicity in the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) with a period of 12, since \( z^{12} + \frac{1}{z^{12}} = z^0 + \frac{1}{z^0} = 2 \) and the sequence will repeat.

To find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we note that \( 85 \mod 12 = 1 \). Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Thus, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

We need to find the area of triangle $ENG$ given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144. We know that the medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid $G$, which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. The centroid also has the property that it divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area.

[ADVANCE]

Since the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144, and the centroid divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area, the area of each of these smaller triangles is $\frac{144}{6} = 24$. The triangle $ENG$ is one of these smaller triangles.

[ADVANCE]

We also know that the line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ at $M$ and $AC$ at $N$. Since $G$ is the centroid, it divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, and the line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ will create a smaller triangle $AMN$ that is similar to triangle $ABC$ with a ratio of similarity of $\frac{2}{3}$ (since $G$ is $\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from the vertices to the midpoints of the opposite sides).

[ADVANCE]

The area of triangle $AMN$ will be $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$. So, the area of triangle $AMN$ is $\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64$. Since the area of the six smaller triangles created by the medians is 144, and triangle $AMN$ is composed of 4 of these smaller triangles, the remaining area for the other 2 smaller triangles (including $ENG$) and the triangle $AGN$ is $144 - 64 = 80$. Since $ENG$ is one of the remaining 2 smaller triangles, and we know that the smaller triangles are equal in area, the area of $ENG$ is half of the remaining area, which is $\frac{80}{2} = 40$.

However, we can simplify this by directly using the fact that $ENG$ is $\frac{1}{6}$ of the area of $ABC$ since the centroid divides the triangle into 6 equal areas.

So, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{144}{6} = 24$.

We are given an arithmetic progression (AP) with the fourth term equal to 200 and the eighth term equal to 500. We need to find the sixth term of the AP.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first term of the AP as $a$ and the common difference as $d$. The $n$-th term of an AP is given by the formula: $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.

Given that the fourth term is 200, we can write:
\[a + 3d = 200 \quad \text{(1)}\]

Given that the eighth term is 500, we can write:
\[a + 7d = 500 \quad \text{(2)}\]

We can solve these two equations to find the values of $a$ and $d$.

[ADVANCE]

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate $a$:
\[(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now, substitute $d = 75$ into equation (1) to find $a$:
\[a + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a + 225 = 200\]
\[a = -25\]

Now that we have the values of $a$ and $d$, we can find the sixth term of the AP using the formula $a_n = a + (n-1)d$:
\[a_6 = a + 5d = -25 + 5(75) = -25 + 375 = 350\]

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ into a decimal that ends.

To convert the fraction into a decimal, we need to manipulate the denominator to be a power of 10. Since $10 = 2 \cdot 5$, we can achieve this by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $2^5$ to make the denominator $10^7$.

The fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 2^5} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}

The problem involves selecting random numbers from the first six prime numbers, which are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We need to find the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Pol and Jessy is even.

[ADVANCE]

To have an even sum, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd. The first six prime numbers contain only one even number, which is 2, and five odd numbers, which are 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Since each person chooses a number from the six prime numbers, the total number of outcomes is $6 \times 6 = 36$.

Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two ways: (1) both numbers are even, or (2) both numbers are odd.

(1) The number of ways both numbers can be even is $1 \times 1 = 1$, since there is only one even number (2) and each person can choose it independently.

(2) The number of ways both numbers can be odd is $5 \times 5 = 25$, since there are five odd numbers and each person can choose any of them independently.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes is $1 + 25 = 26$.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Pol and Jessy is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}$.

The rectangle is 4 units high and 3 units wide. The diagonals divide the rectangle into four triangles, but the shaded regions are only two of these triangles. We need to calculate the area of these two triangles.

The first triangle is formed by the points (0, 4), (0, 0), and (2, 0). The base of this triangle is 2 units (from (0, 0) to (2, 0)) and the height is 4 units (from (0, 0) to (0, 4)). The area of this triangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

The second triangle is formed by the points (0, 4), (3, 4), and (3, 0). The base of this triangle is 3 units (from (0, 4) to (3, 4) horizontally, but considering the vertical distance from (3, 4) to (3, 0) which is 4 units, and the horizontal distance from (0, 4) to (3, 4) which is 3 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the actual base of the triangle, but we can also see that the triangle is a right triangle with legs 3 and 4, so the area is:
\[
\text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6
\]

However, we need to consider the correct triangles formed by the diagonals. The correct approach is to calculate the area of the triangles formed by the diagonals of the rectangle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The diagonals of the rectangle divide it into four triangles of equal area. The total area of the rectangle is $4 \times 3 = 12$ square units. Since the diagonals divide the rectangle into four equal triangles, the area of each triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of each triangle} = \frac{12}{4} = 3

The shaded region consists of two of these triangles, so the total area of the shaded region is:
\[

The problem requires finding the smallest positive multiple of 450, where all the digits are either 0 or 1.

To solve this, we need to consider the factors of 450, which are 2, 3, 3, and 5, 5. This means the number we are looking for must be divisible by $2$, $3^2$, and $5^2$.

For a number to be divisible by 2, it must end in 0.
For a number to be divisible by $3^2$ (or 9), the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.
For a number to be divisible by $5^2$ (or 25), the last two digits must be 00, 25, 50, or 75. However, since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the last two digits must be 00.

Given these constraints, we need to find the smallest number consisting of only 0s and 1s that ends in 00 and has a digit sum divisible by 9.

[ADVANCE]

The smallest number consisting of only 1s that is divisible by 9 is 111 (since $1+1+1=3$, which is not divisible by 9), then 111111 (since $1+1+1+1+1+1=6$, which is not divisible by 9), and finally 111111111 (since $1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=9$, which is divisible by 9).

We can append 00 to 111111111 to get a number that ends in 00 and is divisible by 2 and 25. Therefore, the smallest number consisting of only 0s and 1s that is a multiple of 450 is 11111111100.

[VERIFY]

We have constructed the number 11111111100, which meets all the criteria: it is a multiple of 450, and all its digits are either 0 or 1. We can verify that 11111111100 is indeed divisible by 450 by checking its divisibility by 2, 3, 3, 5, and 5.

- It is divisible by 2 because it ends in 0.
- The sum of its digits is $1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0=9$, which is divisible by 9, so it is divisible by 9.
- It is divisible by 25 because it ends in 00.

Since 11111111100 meets all the conditions, we can conclude that it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1.

The final answer is $\boxed{11111111100}$.

Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$.

(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ) = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ).
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}$. Now, we need to find the product of the remaining terms.

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x$ to simplify the product. Let's apply this identity to the terms $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Now, we need to find the product $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin^2 20^\circ)(\sin^2 40^\circ)(\sin^2 60^\circ)(\sin^2 80^\circ)$. We can rewrite it as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

The problem asks for the geometric shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) represents the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis, \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane measured from the positive \(x\)-axis, and \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height \(z\) is constant, regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This means that for any value of \(r\) and \(\theta\), the \(z\)-coordinate remains the same.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Given that \(z\) is constant and can take any value for \(r\) and \(\theta\), the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane. This is because the height \(z\) is the same for all points in the \(xy\)-plane, regardless of the radial distance \(r\) and angular coordinate \(\theta\).

Therefore, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane in 3-dimensional space.

We need to find the smallest possible angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.

Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{2 \cdot 7} = \frac{1}{2}.

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, we can express $g(x)$ as $g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015$.

The sum of the roots of a polynomial can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the sum of the roots is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$.

Since $g(x)$ is a cubic function, we can find the sum of its roots by determining the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in $g(x)$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we need to determine the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We can do this by expanding $f(x + 5)$.

Expanding $f(x + 5)$, we get:
\[
g(x) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015.
\]
Expanding each term, we have:
\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125,
\]
\[
-49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225,
\]
\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115.
\]
Combining all these terms, we get:
\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015.
\]
Simplifying the expression, we have:
\[
g(x) = x^3 + (15 - 49)x^2 + (75 - 490 + 623)x + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 188x + 0.
\]
The coefficient of the $x^2$ term in $g(x)$ is $-34$. Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $-\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{-34}{1} = 34$.

The problem requires us to compute the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression as:
\[

\]
Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\), we can further rewrite the expression as:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to proceed.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]
We need to find the sum of the squares of the tangents of these angles.

We can use the identity for the sum of squares of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. For angles \(10^\circ\), \(50^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), which are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of \(40^\circ\), we can use the known result:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

This is a known trigonometric identity for these specific angles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Substituting the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9\) into the expression, we get:

The problem involves finding the number of sides in an convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles, except one, is $1070^{\circ}$.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. If the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, then the sum of all interior angles including the missing one is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. Let the missing interior angle be $x$. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x
\]
Since the interior angle of a polygon must be less than $180^{\circ}$, we can solve for $x$ and then for $n$.

[ADVANCE]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}
\]
We know that $0 < x < 180^{\circ}$. So, we can set up the inequality:
\[
0 < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}
\]
We can split this into two inequalities:
\[
0 < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}
\]
and
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}
\]
Solving the first inequality:
\[
1070^{\circ} < (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}
\]
\[
\frac{1070^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}} < n-2
\]
\[
5.94 < n-2
\]
\[
7.94 < n
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we get:
\[
n \geq 8
\]
Solving the second inequality:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 180^{\circ} + 1070^{\circ}
\]
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ}
\]
\[
n-2 < \frac{1250^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}}
\]
\[
n-2 < 6.94
\]
\[
n < 8.94
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we get:
\[
n \leq 8
\]
Combining the two results, we get:
\[
n = 8

The problem requires finding a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to find \( t \) such that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \). We can solve this quadratic congruence by finding the values of \( t \) that satisfy the equation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), we can use the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in the values, we get:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \]

We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). Since \( 2 \) is a quadratic residue modulo \( 23 \), we can find its square root. By checking, we find that \( 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \) and \( 8^2 \equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \), but \( 10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \) and \( 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \) and \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -18 \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \).

Thus, we have two possible solutions:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 - 18 \equiv -19 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer, we select \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

The problem asks for the total surface area of a cube in square inches, given that the cube has a volume of 1 cubic foot.

First, we need to understand the conversion between feet and inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Next, we calculate the side length of the cube in inches. Since the volume of the cube is 1 cubic foot, the side length of the cube in feet is $\sqrt[3]{1} = 1$ foot. Converting this to inches, the side length is $1 \times 12 = 12$ inches.

The surface area of a cube is given by the formula $6s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the cube.

We need to simplify the expression inside the sine function. Recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\) and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\).

[ADVANCE]

For \(x > 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
For \(x < 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
However, we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x\). Therefore, we can simplify the expression as:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have a contradiction because \(1 \neq \frac{1}{3}\). This means our initial assumption or simplification might be incorrect, or there might be no real solutions to the equation.

However, we should consider the domain and range of the inverse trigonometric functions and the sine function to ensure we haven't missed any possible solutions.

Given the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\), we can use it to simplify the original equation:

This implies that the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) has no solution because the sine of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) is 1, not \(\frac{1}{3}\).

and
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.\]
Since the lines are parallel, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. We can see that the direction vector of the second line is twice the direction vector of the first line:
\[\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
This confirms that the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can use the points \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):
\[\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]
The distance between the two parallel lines is the length of the projection of this vector onto the normal vector of the planes formed by the lines. The normal vector can be found by taking the cross product of the direction vector of the lines and the vector connecting the points on the lines. However, since the lines are parallel, we can use the direction vector of the lines directly.

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines can be calculated using the formula:
\[D = \frac{\left\| \vec{a} \times \vec{b} \right\|}{\left\| \vec{b} \right\|},\]
where \(\vec{a}\) is the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line, and \(\vec{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we calculate the cross product \(\vec{a} \times \vec{b}\):
\[\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2) = \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.\]
Next, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.\]
We also calculate the magnitude of the direction vector:
\[\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.\]
Finally, we calculate the distance:
\[D = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.\]

We can use the distributive property of the cross product to expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$:
\[(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.\]
Since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, the expression simplifies to:
\[6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.\]
We can substitute the given values for the cross products:
\[6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so:
\[6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
Now we can perform the scalar multiplications and additions:
\[6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},\]
\[2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},\]
\[-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.\]

The problem involves finding the average price of Juan's stamps from the 1970s. The prices of the stamps from different countries are given, and we need to calculate the average price of the stamps from the 1970s.

The prices of the stamps are:
- Brazil: 6 cents
- France: 5 cents
- Peru: 4 cents
- Spain: 5 cents

The number of stamps from the 1970s for each country is:
- Brazil: 12 stamps

- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

We need to calculate the total cost of the stamps from the 1970s and then find the average price.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the total cost of the stamps from the 1970s, we need to multiply the number of stamps from each country by their respective prices and then sum these values.

The total cost of the stamps from Brazil is $12 \times 6 = 72$ cents.
The total cost of the stamps from France is $12 \times 5 = 60$ cents.
The total cost of the stamps from Peru is $6 \times 4 = 24$ cents.
The total cost of the stamps from Spain is $13 \times 5 = 65$ cents.

The total cost of all the stamps from the 1970s is $72 + 60 + 24 + 65 = 221$ cents.

The total number of stamps from the 1970s is $12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43$.

Next, we can calculate the average price of the stamps from the 1970s by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps.

The average price is $\frac{221}{43} \approx 5.14$ cents.

We are given a trapezium $ABCD$ where $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ divides $\angle BAD$ in half. The area of the trapezium $[ABCD]$ is 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ divides $\angle BAD$ in half and $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, we can infer that $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle with $\angle ACD = 90^\circ$. Let's denote the length of $\overline{AD}$ as $a$, the length of $\overline{CD}$ as $h$, and the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $x$.

The area of $\triangle ACD$ is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot h
\]

Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem and the properties of right triangles to find the relationship between the sides of the trapezium.

[ADVANCE]

The area of the trapezium $[ABCD]$ is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (AD + BC) \cdot h = 42
\]
We can express the area of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ in terms of their bases and heights. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAD$, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is equal to the ratio of their bases $BC$ and $AD$.

Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height for both $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$, the ratio of the areas is:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{BC}{AD}
\]
Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, the ratio of the areas of the triangles is equal to the ratio of the bases.

We know that the area of the trapezium is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$:
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]
Let $[\triangle ACD] = x$, then $[\triangle ABC] = \frac{BC}{AD} \cdot x$. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height for both triangles, we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the bases:
\[
\frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{42 - x}{x}
\]
Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector, we can also use the fact that the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the segments of the base:
\[
\frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{AC}{CD} = \frac{AC}{h}
\]
However, we need to find a direct relationship between the areas. We can use the fact that the area of the trapezium is the average of the bases times the height:
\[
\frac{AD + BC}{2} \cdot h = 42
\]
We also know that:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot h = x
\]
\[
AD \cdot h = 2x
\]
Substituting $AD \cdot h = 2x$ into the equation for the area of the trapezium:
\[
\frac{AD + BC}{2} \cdot h = 42
\]
\[
(AD + BC) \cdot h = 84
\]
\[
AD \cdot h + BC \cdot h = 84
\]
\[
2x + BC \cdot h = 84
\]
We also know that:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h = 42 - x
\]
\[
BC \cdot h = 2(42 - x) = 84 - 2x
\]
Substituting $BC \cdot h = 84 - 2x$ into the equation:
\[
2x + 84 - 2x = 84
\]
This equation is an identity, so we need to find another relationship. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height for both triangles, we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the bases:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{42 - x}{x}
\]
We can also use the fact that the trapezium can be divided into two triangles with a common height:
\[
\frac{AD + BC}{2} \cdot h = 42
\]
Since $AD \cdot h = 2x$, we can express $BC$ in terms of $x$:
\[
BC = \frac{84 - 2x}{h}
\]
Substituting $BC = \frac{84 - 2x}{h}$ into the ratio:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{84 - 2x}{h} \cdot h}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot h} = \frac{42 - x}{x}
\]
\[
\frac{84 - 2x}{AD \cdot h} = \frac{42 - x}{x}
\]
Since $AD \cdot h = 2x$:
\[
\frac{84 - 2x}{2x} = \frac{42 - x}{x}
\]
\[
42 - x = 42 - x
\]
This equation is an identity, so we need to find another approach. We can use the fact that the area of the trapezium is the sum of the areas of the triangles:
\[
x + (42 - x) = 42
\]
We can also use the fact that the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the bases. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem:
\[
\frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{BC}{AD}
\]
We can use the fact that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $x$ and the area of the trapezium is 42:
\[
x + \frac{BC}{AD} \cdot x = 42
\]
Since $\frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{42 - x}{x}$:
\[
x + \frac{42 - x}{x} \cdot x = 42
\]
\[
x + 42 - x = 42
\]
This equation is an identity, so we need to find another approach. We can use the fact that the area of the trapezium is the average of the bases times the height:
\[
\frac{AD + BC}{2} \cdot h = 42

\[
AD \cdot h + BC \cdot h = 84

\[
2x + BC \cdot h = 84

We also know that:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h = 42 - x

\[
BC \cdot h = 2(42 - x) = 84 - 2x

This equation is an identity, so we need to find another relationship. We can use the fact that the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the bases:

Since the trapezium can be divided into two triangles with a common height, we can use the fact that the area of the trapezium is the sum of the areas of the triangles:
\[
x + (42 - x) = 42

We can use the fact that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $x$ and the area of the trapezium is 42. We can also use the fact that the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the bases. Since $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem. After re-evaluating the problem, we can use the fact that the area of the trapezium is the average of the bases times the height, and the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $x$. We can also use the fact that the ratio of the areas is equal to the ratio of the bases.

To solve the equation, we can start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots. This gives us:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}

Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for $x$:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
8x - 27x = -9

\[

Dividing both sides by $-19$, we find:
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}

Next action: [VERIFY]
We need to ensure that the solution satisfies the original equation and that the expression under the square root is non-negative. We substitute $x = \frac{9}{19}$ back into the original equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27-19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
The solution satisfies the original equation. Additionally, we check that the expression under the square root is non-negative:
\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} > 0
\]
\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - 1 = \frac{27-19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0

We will substitute the given fractions into the operation definition. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Plugging these values into the operation definition, we get:

\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

Now, we will perform the multiplication and simplify the expression.

First, we multiply the numbers:
\[

So, the expression becomes:
\[

Next, we simplify the fraction $\frac{21}{30}$. The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we multiply 70 by $\frac{7}{10}$:
\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right) = \frac{70 \cdot 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

The problem involves determining the probability that two randomly chosen chords on a circle intersect. To solve this, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circle and the conditions under which the chords intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect, we can use the fact that the order of the points on the circle determines whether the chords intersect. Specifically, the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are arranged on the circle in an alternating manner (i.e., the points are in the order $ABCD$, $ADCB$, $ACBD$, or $DCBA$).

Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, we can consider the total number of possible arrangements of the four points on the circle. There are $4! = 24$ possible orderings of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.

Out of these 24 possible orderings, the number of orderings where the chords intersect is 8 (specifically, the orderings $ABCD$, $ADCB$, $ACBD$, $DCBA$, and their cyclic permutations).

Therefore, the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\frac{8}{24} = \frac{1}{3}$.

The problem requires us to calculate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\).

We can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine to simplify the expression. The angle sum identity for sine is \(\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), and the angle difference identity for sine is \(\sin (A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B\).

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\).

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), \(\alpha\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), \(\beta\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we can use the angle sum and difference identities:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}.

The expression we need to calculate is:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{21})^2}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -\frac{9}{100}.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We will calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only one party represented.

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 people is given by $\binom{14}{5}$.

The number of ways to choose 5 members with only Republicans is $\binom{8}{5}$, and the number of ways to choose 5 members with only Democrats is $\binom{6}{5}$.

We will subtract the sum of these two cases from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, let's calculate the values:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee with at least one representative from each party is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940
\]

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least one representative from each party is $\boxed{1940}$.

The problem asks for the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\). This expression is in the form of a difference of squares, which can be factored as \((a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)\).

[ADVANCE]

We can apply the difference of squares formula to the given expression:
\[513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487).\]
Now, we can calculate the values inside the parentheses:
\[513 - 487 = 26,\]
\[513 + 487 = 1000.\]
So, the expression simplifies to:
\[513^2 - 487^2 = 26 \times 1000 = 26000.\]

The problem involves finding three consecutive integers whose product is 120. We also know that the product divided by the average of these three numbers equals 24. We need to identify the three consecutive integers and determine the largest among them.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\). The product of these integers is given by:
\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]
We also know that the product divided by the average of these three numbers equals 24. The average of the three numbers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]
So, the given condition can be written as:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]
Which further simplifies to:
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]
Solving for \(n\), we get:
\[
n^2 = 25 \implies n = \pm 5
\]
We now have two possible values for \(n\): 5 and -5. We need to check which of these values satisfy the original equation \((n-1)n(n+1) = 120\).

For \(n = 5\):
\[
(5-1) \cdot 5 \cdot (5+1) = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]
This satisfies the equation.

For \(n = -5\):
\[
(-5-1) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-5+1) = (-6) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-4) = -120
\]
This does not satisfy the equation.

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\). The largest of these integers is 6.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem is to find the largest of three consecutive integers whose product is 120, and the product divided by their average is 24. We denoted the integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\), and used the given conditions to form equations. Solving these equations, we found that \(n = 5\) is the valid solution, corresponding to the integers 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the largest of these integers is \(\boxed{6}\).

The problem requires finding the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we start by isolating the expression inside the cube root. We can do this by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).

[ADVANCE]
Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
\]
This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62
\]
Since we are asked to find the positive value of \( x \), we select \( x = 66 \).

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} - 2 \pi \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

So the expression becomes \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\) to simplify the expression. Let's multiply and divide the expression by \(\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)\) to use the double-angle identity for sine.

\[

Using the double-angle identity \(\sin (2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \sin \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity again:

\[

\]

Since \(\sin (\pi + x) = -\sin x\) and \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} (-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)) (-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right))}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity again:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{16}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote $\angle BAC = \theta$, then $\angle BDC = 3\theta$. Since $AM$ is the height of the triangle $ABC$, $\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}$. We can use the fact that $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$ to find a relationship between the angles.

Since $D$ lies on $AM$, we can use the fact that $\triangle BDM$ and $\triangle CDM$ are right triangles. We can also use the fact that $\angle BDC = 180^\circ - \angle BDM - \angle CDM$.

Next, we can use the Law of Sines in $\triangle BDC$ to relate the sides and angles. We have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}
\]
Since $\angle BDC = 3\theta$ and $\angle BAC = \theta$, we can use the fact that $\angle BCD = 180^\circ - \angle BDC - \angle CBD = 180^\circ - 3\theta - \angle CBD$.

We can also use the fact that $AM = 11$ and $AD = 10$, so $DM = 1$. We can use the right triangles $\triangle ABM$ and $\triangle ADM$ to find the length of $BM$ and $AM$.

Let's denote $BM = x$, then $AB = \sqrt{x^2 + 11^2}$. We can use the fact that $\triangle BDM$ is a right triangle to find the length of $BD$:
\[
BD = \sqrt{x^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}
\]
We can use the Law of Sines in $\triangle BDC$ to relate the sides and angles:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\sin \angle BCD}

We can also use the fact that $\angle BAC = \theta$ and $\angle BAM = \frac{\theta}{2}$ to find the length of $AB$:
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}

We can use the fact that $AB = AC$ to find the length of $AC$:

\]
We can use the fact that $\triangle ABM$ is a right triangle to find the length of $BM$:
\[
BM = \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{11}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}\right)^2 - 11^2} = \sqrt{\frac{121}{\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} - 121} = \sqrt{121 \left(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} - 1\right)}
\]
We can use the fact that $\triangle BDM$ is a right triangle to find the length of $BD$:
\[
BD = \sqrt{BM^2 + MD^2} = \sqrt{121 \left(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} - 1\right) + 1}
\]
We can use the Law of Sines in $\triangle BDC$ to relate the sides and angles:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD}
\]
We can simplify the expression and solve for $\theta$.

After solving, we find that $\theta = 30^\circ$. We can use the fact that $\angle BAC = 30^\circ$ to find the length of $AB$:
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\sin 15^\circ} = \frac{11}{\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}} = \frac{44}{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{44(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{6 - 2} = 11(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})
\]
We can use the fact that $AB = AC$ to find the length of $AC$:
\[
AC = 11(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})
\]
We can use the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle ABM$ to find the length of $BM$:
\[
BM = \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = \sqrt{(11(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}))^2 - 11^2} = \sqrt{121(6 + 2 + 2\sqrt{12}) - 121} = \sqrt{121(8 + 4\sqrt{3}) - 121} = \sqrt{121(7 + 4\sqrt{3})} = 11\sqrt{7 + 4\sqrt{3}}

We can use the fact that $BC = 2BM$ to find the length of $BC$:
\[
BC = 2BM = 22\sqrt{7 + 4\sqrt{3}}

We can use the fact that the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $AB + AC + BC$ to find the perimeter:
\[

Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$. Since the sequence consists of 27 consecutive integers, the terms can be represented as $a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum can be calculated as:
\[ S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27(a + 13) \]
We are given that the sum of the sequence is $3^7 = 2187$. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 27(a + 13) = 2187 \]
Solving for $a$:
\[ a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81 \]
\[ a = 81 - 13 = 68 \]
The sequence of numbers is $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$.

[ADVANCE]
Since the sequence has an odd number of terms (27), the median is the middle term, which is the 14th term. The 14th term of the sequence can be found as:

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We can start by solving the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. Let's make a substitution to simplify the inequality. Set $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y < 21$. Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality: $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factor the quadratic expression: $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. This inequality holds when $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we substitute back to get $-7 < x^2 < 3$. Because $x^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$, the left part of the inequality $-7 < x^2$ is always true for real $x$. So, we are left with $x^2 < 3$, which gives us $-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, we need to solve the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. Using the same substitution $y = x^2$, the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y > -4$. Rearrange this to form a standard quadratic inequality: $y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0$. We can factor the quadratic expression: $(y + 2)^2 > 0$. This inequality holds for all real $y$ except when $y = -2$. Since $y = x^2$, we have $x^2 \neq -2$, which is true for all real $x$ because $x^2 \geq 0$.

\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,$ we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we need to express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ in terms of $xy + yz + zx.$ We can use the identity:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $x + y + z$ by $p$ and $xy + yz + zx$ by $q.$ Then, we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = p^2 - 2q.\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 2q - q) = p(p^2 - 3q).\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We also have the equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be factored as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = xy(p - z) + xz(p - y) + yz(p - x) = 12.\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[p(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $xyz = 4$ and $xy + xz + yz = q,$ we have:
\[pq - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[pq - 12 = 12,\]
so
\[pq = 24.\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We now have two equations:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q)\]
and
\[pq = 24.\]
We can solve for $q$ in terms of $p$ from the second equation:
\[q = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = p\left(p^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{p}\right) = p(p^2 - \frac{72}{p}) = p^3 - 72.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[p^3 = 64,\]
so
\[p = 4.\]
Now, substituting $p = 4$ back into the equation $pq = 24,$ we get:
\[4q = 24,\]
so
\[q = 6.\]

To find the class where the number of boys using the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of girls using the bus, we need to calculate the number of boys and girls using the bus for each class, and then compare the number of boys to $135\%$ of the number of girls.

Let's calculate the number of boys and girls using the bus for each class:

- For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ class:
  - Number of boys using the bus: $300 \times 0.116 = 34.8$
  - Number of girls using the bus: $300 \times 0.086 = 25.8$
  - $135\%$ of the number of girls using the bus: $25.8 \times 1.35 = 34.83$

Next, we need to find the class where the number of boys using the bus is closest to $135\%$ of the number of girls using the bus. We can calculate the absolute difference between the number of boys and $135\%$ of the number of girls for each class:

- For the $9^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: $|123.3 - 159.37| = 36.07$
- For the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: $|103.2 - 133.555| = 30.355$

- For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ class: $|34.8 - 34.83| = 0.03$

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator and when the numerator is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). However, these values make the fraction undefined because the denominator is zero. So, we must exclude \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) from the solution set.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These values also make the fraction undefined. So, we must exclude \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) from the solution set.

Now, we need to determine the sign of the fraction in the intervals defined by the critical points \(x = -9, 0, 9, 36\).

[ADVANCE]

We will test the sign of the fraction in the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
   \(\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{-10(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{-10(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
   \(\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{-1(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{-1(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
   \(\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{1(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 10\):
   \(\frac{|(10-9)(10+9)|}{10(10-36)} = \frac{|(1)(19)|}{10(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
   \(\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{40(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{40(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0\).

From the sign analysis, the fraction is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

[ADVANCE]

Since the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), we do not include the endpoints. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

The problem involves finding the maximum possible area of a rectangular field surrounded by a running track. The track consists of two straight sides of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangular field as $L$ and the width as $W$. The two semicircles together form a full circle with a radius equal to the width of the field, $W$. The circumference of this circle is $2\pi W$. The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle: $2L + 2\pi W = 400$.

We need to express the area of the rectangular field, $A = L \times W$, in terms of one variable and then find the maximum value of the area.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

From the equation $2L + 2\pi W = 400$, we can solve for $L$ in terms of $W$:
\[ L = 200 - \pi W. \]
The area of the rectangular field is given by $A = L \times W$. Substituting the expression for $L$ into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = (200 - \pi W)W = 200W - \pi W^2. \]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $W$, set it to zero, and solve for $W$:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - 2\pi W. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:
\[ 200 - 2\pi W = 0. \]
Solving for $W$, we get:
\[ W = \frac{200}{2\pi} = \frac{100}{\pi}. \]
Now, we can find the corresponding value of $L$:
\[ L = 200 - \pi \left(\frac{100}{\pi}\right) = 200 - 100 = 100. \]
The area of the field is:
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{100}{\pi} = \frac{10000}{\pi}. \]
To confirm that this value of $W$ gives a maximum, we can check the second derivative:
\[ \frac{d^2A}{dW^2} = -2\pi, \]
which is negative, indicating a maximum.

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin{T}$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the length of the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin{R} = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ has length 2 and the hypotenuse has length 5.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this length as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we can find $\sin{T}$. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle $T$, the opposite side is the side that was previously the adjacent side to angle $R$, which has length $\sqrt{21}$, and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, $\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The value of $\sin{T}$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.

The problem asks for the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. The distance between the origin and a point $(x, y)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We need to express this distance in terms of $x$ and then find the minimum value.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The distance $D$ between the origin and a point $(x, y)$ on the graph is given by:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2-3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2-3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's denote this expression as $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
This gives us the critical points $x = 0$ and $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$. We need to evaluate $f(x)$ at these points to find the minimum value.
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, which occurs at $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the minimum distance $D$ is:
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The minimum distance can be expressed as $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$.

We are given a piecewise function $f(x)$ and asked to find the value of $f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6)$. To do this, we need to find the inverse functions for both pieces of $f(x)$ and then determine the values of $f^{-1}(0)$ and $f^{-1}(6)$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find $f^{-1}(0)$, we need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$ for both pieces of the piecewise function.

1. For $x \leq 3$, we have $f(x) = 3 - x$. Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.\]
Since $x = 3$ is within the domain $x \leq 3$, it is a valid solution. Therefore, $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.

2. For $x > 3$, we have $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x$. Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.\]
This gives us two possible solutions: $x = 0$ or $-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0$. Since $x = 0$ is not within the domain $x > 3$, we discard it. Solving the quadratic equation $-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0$, we get:
\[x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \implies x = 3 \text{ or } x = -1.\]
Since neither $x = 3$ nor $x = -1$ is within the domain $x > 3$, there is no valid solution for $f(x) = 0$ in this piece of the function. Therefore, we can confirm that $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.

Next, we need to find $f^{-1}(6)$ by solving the equation $f(x) = 6$ for both pieces of the piecewise function.

1. For $x \leq 3$, we have $f(x) = 3 - x$. Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.\]
Since $x = -3$ is within the domain $x \leq 3$, it is a valid solution. Therefore, one possible value for $f^{-1}(6)$ is $x = -3$.

2. For $x > 3$, we have $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x$. Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0.\]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation. By inspection, we find that $x = 2$ is not a root, but we can check if there are any integer roots greater than 3. Trying $x = 3$, we get:
\[-3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 3 \cdot 3 - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = -6 \neq 0.\]
Since $x = 3$ is not a root and the calculations for other integers greater than 3 would be more complex without a clear root, we can verify that $x = -3$ from the first piece is the correct value for $f^{-1}(6)$ based on the given domain restrictions and the need to find a valid solution.

Therefore, $f^{-1}(6) = -3$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have found $f^{-1}(0) = 3$ and $f^{-1}(6) = -3$, we can calculate the sum:
\[f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to the other five vertices. The distances from $P$ to the five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The key insight here is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. Let's denote the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex as $x$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices of the octahedron is the same for any point $P$.

The sum of the squares of the given distances is:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324.\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices is constant, we can set up the equation:
\[324 + x^2 = \text{constant}.\]

However, we need to find the constant value. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices is the same for any point. The center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices, and the distance from the center to any vertex is the same.

Let's denote the side length of the regular octahedron as $s$. The distance from the center of the octahedron to any vertex is $\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the six vertices is:
\[6 \left(\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = 6 \cdot \frac{s^2}{2} = 3s^2.\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of the octahedron is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. Therefore, the constant value is $3s^2$.

We can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of the octahedron is equal to six times the square of the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices. However, we can directly use the sum of the squares of the given distances to find the distance to the sixth vertex.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices is constant, we can set up the equation:
\[324 + x^2 = 3s^2.\]

However, we need to find the value of $3s^2$. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. The sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is $3s^2$, and we can also express it as the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the vertices.

Since the problem does not provide the side length of the octahedron, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of the octahedron is constant. We can directly use the sum of the squares of the given distances to find the distance to the sixth vertex.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the six vertices is:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}.\]

We can assume that the constant value is the same for any point $P$. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[324 + x^2 = \text{constant}.\]

Since the problem does not provide the side length of the octahedron, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of the octahedron is constant. We can directly use the sum of the squares of the given distances to find the distance to the sixth vertex.

The correct approach is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of the octahedron is constant. We can set up the equation:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 2 \times (3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 - x^2).\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[324 + x^2 = 2 \times (324 - x^2).\]

Solving for $x^2$, we get:
\[324 + x^2 = 648 - 2x^2.\]
\[3x^2 = 324.\]
\[x^2 = 108.\]
\[x = \sqrt{108} = \sqrt{36 \times 3} = 6\sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex is $\boxed{6\sqrt{3}}$.

We can use Newton's second law, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a). For Djen's throw, the force is $F_D = m_D \cdot a_D$, and for Jack's throw, the force is $F_J = m_J \cdot a_J$. Since the forces are equal, we can set up the equation $m_D \cdot a_D = m_J \cdot a_J$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base-7:

\[ 89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5 \]

So, the base-7 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1556_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base-8:
\[ 629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
\[ 9 \div 8 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
So, the base-8 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1165_8$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the polynomial $g(x)$, we need to substitute $x-1$ for $x$ in the polynomial $f(x)$. So, we have:
\[g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2.\]

Next, we need to expand the expression for $g(x)$.

\[g(x) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2.\]

Expanding each term:
\[(x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1,\]
\[(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1.\]

Substituting these expansions back into the expression for $g(x)$:
\[g(x) = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) + 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 9(x - 1) - 2.\]

\[g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2.\]

Combining like terms:
\[g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15.\]

Next, we need to find the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ is obtained by substituting $x = 1$ into the polynomial.

So, we substitute $x = 1$ into $g(x)$:
\[g(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15.\]

We need to find the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. Let's denote these expressions as $a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. We know that:
\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

We also know that:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2(-2) = -4.
\]
This implies that $abc = -4$. Since $a + b + c = 0$, we can consider the polynomial whose roots are $a$, $b$, and $c$:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = t^3 + 4 = 0.
\]
The roots of this polynomial are the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. We can solve for the roots of $t^3 + 4 = 0$:
\[
t^3 = -4 \implies t = \sqrt[3]{-4} = \sqrt[3]{4} \cdot \sqrt[3]{-1} = \sqrt[3]{4} \cdot \omega,
\]
where $\omega$ is a cube root of $-1$. The cube roots of $-4$ are:
\[
\sqrt[3]{4} \cdot \omega, \quad \sqrt[3]{4} \cdot \omega^2, \quad \sqrt[3]{4} \cdot \omega^3 = \sqrt[3]{4} \cdot (-1) = -\sqrt[3]{4},
\]
where $\omega = e^{i\pi/3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{i2\pi/3}$. Therefore, the set of values is:
\[
\left\{ \sqrt[3]{4} \cdot e^{i\pi/3}, \sqrt[3]{4} \cdot e^{i2\pi/3}, -\sqrt[3]{4} \right\}.
\]
However, we are asked for the non-upordered set of values of the expressions, which means we need to consider the real and imaginary parts and their combinations. But since the problem is symmetric and we are dealing with roots of a polynomial, we can conclude that the set of values is simply the set of real numbers that satisfy the equation.

Next action: [SYNTHESIZE]

From the previous steps, we have determined that the values of the expressions $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$ are the roots of the polynomial $t^3 + 4 = 0$. The roots of this polynomial are $\sqrt[3]{4} \cdot e^{i\pi/3}$, $\sqrt[3]{4} \cdot e^{i2\pi/3}$, and $-\sqrt[3]{4}$. Since we are asked for the non-upordered set of values, we can conclude that the set of values is $\left\{ -\sqrt[3]{4}, \sqrt[3]{2} \right\}$, but we need to verify if $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is indeed a value.

However, we can see that the correct non-upordered set of values is indeed $\left\{ -\sqrt[3]{4} \right\}$, but we need to consider if there are other real values. By Vieta's formulas and the symmetry of the problem, we can conclude that the set of values is indeed $\left\{ -\sqrt[3]{4} \right\}$.

Therefore, the non-upordered set of values is:

The problem asks for the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$.

To solve this, we need to convert the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$ into its decimal form and then identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point.

[ADVANCE]

To convert $\frac{137}{500}$ into a decimal, we can perform the division. However, it's often easier to manipulate the fraction to have a denominator that is a power of 10.

We can rewrite $\frac{137}{500}$ by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get a denominator of 1000:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000} = 0.274
\]

Now, we can see the decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$ is 0.274.

[ADVANCE]

From the decimal expansion 0.274, we can identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point. The digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit is 4.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$ is $\boxed{4}$.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices. We are given that $\frac{AB}{AD} = k$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric regions within the rectangle where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices. The locus of points equidistant to $O$ and a vertex forms the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the center to the vertex. These bisectors divide the rectangle into regions, and we need to find the area of the region where a point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will form a smaller rectangle with its center at $O$ and sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle. The side lengths of this smaller rectangle will be half the length of the diagonals of the four quadrants formed by the perpendicular bisectors.

Let's denote the length of $AD$ as $x$ and the length of $AB$ as $kx$. The distance from $O$ to any vertex is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{kx}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{k^2+1}}{2}x$. The region closer to $O$ than to any vertex is a square with side length equal to the distance from $O$ to the midpoint of the sides of the rectangle, which is $\frac{\sqrt{k^2+1}}{2}x \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{k^2+1}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{k^2+1}} \cdot \sqrt{k^2+1} = x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^2+1}} \cdot \sqrt{k^2+1} = x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{k^2+1}}{k^2+1}$.

The area of this square is $\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{k^2+1}}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2}{k^2+1}$. The area of the original rectangle is $kx \cdot x = kx^2$. The probability that a point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the ratio of these areas: $\frac{\frac{x^2}{k^2+1}}{kx^2} = \frac{1}{k^2+1}$.

We need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) for three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if }n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.

We will calculate each term separately and then sum them up.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) is less than 4, we use \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is equal to 4, we use \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

The problem involves calculating the total amount of money earned by the four girls and then finding the remainder when this total is divided by 100 to determine how much money is left after exchanging cents for dollars and cents.

[ADVANCE]
First, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by the four girls. We will convert each amount from dollars and cents to just cents, and then sum them up.

Linda earned $\$27.47$, which is $2747$ cents.
Sherrie earned $\$35.23$, which is $3523$ cents.
John earned $\$37.37$, which is $3737$ cents.
Connie earned $\$26.52$, which is $2652$ cents.

The total amount of money earned is:
\[ 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652 \]

We will calculate this sum next.

[ADVANCE]
Now, we calculate the sum:
\[ 2747 + 3523 = 6270 \]
\[ 6270 + 3737 = 10007 \]
\[ 10007 + 2652 = 12659 \]

So, the total amount of money earned is $12659$ cents.

Next, we need to find the remainder when $12659$ is divided by $100$ to determine how much money is left after exchanging the maximum number of cents for dollars.

[ADVANCE]
We divide $12659$ by $100$ to find the quotient and the remainder:
\[ 12659 \div 100 = 126 \text{ remainder } 59 \]

The remainder is $59$, which means that after exchanging the maximum number of cents for dollars, they have $59$ cents left.

n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\

We can start by using the property of the magic square that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. Let's denote this common sum as \( S \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can write the equation for the sum of the first row:
\[ (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = S \]
Simplifying this, we get:

Next, we can write the equation for the sum of the second row:
\[ (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = S \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 3n - 6 = S \]

Since both expressions are equal to \( S \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \]
Solving for \( n \), we get:

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the distance traveled by Jim, we need to calculate the length of the diagonal of the rectangular field. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this purpose. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal is the hypotenuse, and the length and width of the field are the other two sides.

The distance traveled by Jim is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Jim}} = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

The distance traveled by Marta is the sum of the length and width of the field:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Marta}} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ feet} \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find out how many feet less Jim traveled compared to Marta, we need to subtract the distance traveled by Jim from the distance traveled by Marta:

We are given that $\omega$ is a complex number such that $\omega^3 = 1.$ We need to find all possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.$

[ADVANCE]

Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2,$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i.$ Note that $\omega^3 - 1 = 0$ can be factored as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.$ Since $\omega \neq 1,$ we have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.$

We can use this relationship to simplify the given expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]
Since $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0,$ we have $\omega^2 = -1 - \omega.$ Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]
To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.
\]
We can simplify further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\omega^2$ (since $\omega^3 = 1$):
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{\omega^2}{\omega^3(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{\omega^2}{1 + \omega}.
\]
Since $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0,$ we have $\omega^2 = -1 - \omega.$ Substituting this in, we get:
\[
-\frac{\omega^2}{1 + \omega} = -\frac{-1 - \omega}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega} = 1.

Thus, the expression simplifies to $1.$
