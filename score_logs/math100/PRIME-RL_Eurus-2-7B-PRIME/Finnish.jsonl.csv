We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can substitute the given value of $\sin D$ and the length of $EF$ to find the length of $DF$. We have:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($DF$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($DE$ and $EF$). Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Solving for $DE^2$, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

# The problem involves complex numbers and rotation in the complex plane.
# We are given the complex number $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$.
# We need to find the complex number $w$ which is the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

# To rotate $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise, we can use the formula for rotation of complex numbers: $w = c + (z - c) \cdot e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta$ is the angle of rotation.
# In this case, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, so $e^{i\theta} = e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
# First, we need to find the difference $z - c$: 
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i. \]
# Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$:
\[ (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right). \]
# We expand this product:
\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. \]
# Finally, we add $c$ to this result to find $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i. \]

The problem asks us to simplify $\sqrt{242}$. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can divide 242 by 2, the smallest prime number, to get:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]
Next, we recognize that 121 is a perfect square, specifically:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root expression:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem is asking for the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table, with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We need to consider the circular permutation and the fact that rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can treat them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the 5 remaining individuals plus the block of 3) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange $n$ units in a circle is $(n-1)!$. So, for 6 units, the number of arrangements is $(6-1)! = 5!$.

Next, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Since there are 3 people in the block, they can be arranged in $3!$ ways.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the units around the circle and the number of ways to arrange the people within the block: $5! \times 3!$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we calculate the value of $5! \times 3!$:
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]
\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]
\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

The problem asks us to find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). The constant term occurs when the powers of \(x\) in the term cancel out, resulting in a term that is independent of \(x\).

[ADVANCE]

To find the constant term, we need to consider the general term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), which is given by the binomial theorem:
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k.
\]
Simplifying this expression, we get:
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}.
\]
Combining the powers of \(x\), we have:
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}.
\]
For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3.
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125.

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. However, it's simpler to directly substitute $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$ into the expression $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ and simplify.

We have:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

So, the product $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 24 \pmod{7}$.

Now, we need to find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7. We can calculate:

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram given the coordinates of the other three vertices. The coordinates of the three vertices are (5, 3), (6, 8), and (7, 4), and we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex (x, y) where x > 7. We also need to calculate the sum x + y.

[ADVANCE]

In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals are the same. Let's use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex. We can consider two possible pairs of diagonals: one pair with vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4), and the other pair with vertices (6, 8) and (x, y).

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal between (5, 3) and (7, 4):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal between (6, 8) and (x, y):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for x:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that x > 7, so x = 6 is not a valid solution. Let's consider the other pair of diagonals: one pair with vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8), and the other pair with vertices (7, 4) and (x, y).

The midpoint of the diagonal between (5, 3) and (6, 8) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal between (7, 4) and (x, y) is:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for x:
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

However, we are given that x > 7, so x = 4 is not a valid solution. We need to reconsider the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

Let's find the fourth vertex by using the property that the vector sum of the diagonals is zero. The vector from (5, 3) to (6, 8) is (1, 5), and the vector from (7, 4) to the fourth vertex (x, y) should be the same.

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex (x, y) can be found by adding the vector (1, 5) to the vertex (7, 4):
\[
(x, y) = (7, 4) + (1, 5) = (8, 9)
\]

Now, we can calculate x + y:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17
\]

Therefore, the value of x + y is \boxed{17}.

We are given a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with $\angle B = 90^\circ$, and the relationship $\sin A = 2\cos A$. We need to find the value of $\tan A$.

[ADVANCE]

We know that $\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ and $\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. This simplifies to $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$.

We also know that $\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$. Using the relationship $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$, we can substitute to find $\tan A$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can divide both sides by $\cos A$ to get $\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = 2$. We know that $\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = \tan A$, so $\tan A = 2$.

Thus, the value of $\tan A$ is $\boxed{2}$.

The problem involves finding the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \). We need to determine the vertical asymptotes \( x = a \) and \( x = b \), and the horizontal asymptote \( y = c \), and then find the sum \( a + b + c \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \), so we solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

We can factor the quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
This gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can calculate the sum \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

We can rewrite the expression using the identity \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\):

We are given two quadratic expressions $3t^2+5t+a$ and $4t^2+bt-2$, and their product is $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. We need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ and then calculate $a+b$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the product of the two quadratic expressions, we can use the distributive property:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
12t^4 + (3b+20)t^3 + (5b-6+4a)t^2 + (ab-10)t - 2a.
\]
We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can set up the following equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26,
\]
\[
5b - 6 + 4a = -8,
\]
\[
ab - 10 = -16,
\]
\[
-2a = 6.
\]

[ADVANCE]

We can solve the equation $-2a = 6$ to find the value of $a$:
\[
a = -3.
\]
Next, we substitute $a = -3$ into the equation $ab - 10 = -16$ to find the value of $b$:
\[
-3b - 10 = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2.
\]
We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by checking the other equations. Substituting $b = 2$ into the equation $3b + 20 = 26$, we get:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26,
\]
which is true. Finally, substituting $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into the equation $5b - 6 + 4a = -8$, we get:
\[
5(2) - 6 + 4(-3) = 10 - 6 - 12 = -8,
\]
which is also true.

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have verified the values of $a$ and $b$, we can calculate $a + b$:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1.

The problem involves finding the radius of a right circular cylinder (lieriön muotoinen säiliö) based on the rate at which it is being filled with water and the rate at which the water level rises.

Given:
- The rate at which the cylinder is being filled with water is $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour.
- The rate at which the water level rises when the cylinder is full is 4 meters per hour.

We need to find the radius of the cylinder.

[ADVANCE]

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour, and the rate at which the height of the water is increasing is 4 meters per hour. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height.

Since the rate of change of the volume is $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour and the rate of change of the height is 4 meters per hour, we can write:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
We can simplify this equation to solve for $r$:
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2
\]
Dividing both sides by $4\pi$:
\[
5 = r^2
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}

The problem involves finding the maximum value of the parameter \(a\) such that the graph of the piecewise function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once. The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]
We need to ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line \(y = k\) for any real number \(k\).

 next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of \(a\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) for both \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

1. For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a quadratic function that opens upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). Since we want the graph to intersect every horizontal line, we need \(a > 0\), otherwise, the quadratic part will not be able to cover all possible \(y\)-values.
2. For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). If \(a > 0\), this linear part will increase as \(x\) increases, and if \(a < 0\), it will decrease.

We need to find the value of \(f(x)\) at the point where the two parts of the function meet, i.e., at \(x = a\). For the quadratic part, \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). For the linear part, as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph to intersect every horizontal line, the value of the quadratic part at \(x = a\) must be less than or equal to the value of the linear part at \(x = a\), i.e., \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).

 next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\). Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.\]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.\]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.\]
We need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true. The critical points are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\).

We can test the sign of the expression \(a(a - 2)(a + 1)\) in the intervals defined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a < -1\), the expression is negative (since there are three negative factors).
- For \(-1 < a < 0\), the expression is positive (since there are two negative factors and one positive factor).
- For \(0 < a < 2\), the expression is negative (since there are two positive factors and one negative factor).
- For \(a > 2\), the expression is positive (since all three factors are positive).

Since we need the expression to be less than or equal to zero, the valid intervals are \((-\infty, -1)\), \([0, 2]\).

However, we also need to ensure that the function \(f(x)\) can intersect every horizontal line. If \(a < 0\), the quadratic part \(ax^2\) will not be able to cover all possible \(y\)-values because it will be a downward-facing parabola and will have a maximum value. Therefore, we discard the interval \((-\infty, -1)\).

The maximum value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is the upper bound of the interval \([0, 2]\), which is \(a = 2\).

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for a given circle equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) with a radius of 1.

To solve this, we need to rewrite the circle equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). We will complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

[ADVANCE]

1. Complete the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

2. Complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

3. Substitute the completed square terms back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we have:
\[ r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \]
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

We need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which there exists $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$ but $f(f(x)) = x$, where $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ and $0 \leq \lambda \leq 4$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, we need to find the expression for $f(f(x))$. We start by calculating $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]
We are given that $f(f(x)) = x$, so we set up the equation:
\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
Since we are looking for $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$, we can assume $x \neq 0$. Therefore, we can divide both sides by $x$:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
Next, we need to find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy this equation for some $x \in [0,1]$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can expand the left-hand side of the equation:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda x^3).\]
So the equation becomes:
\[\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 = 1.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[-\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.\]
We need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which this equation has a solution $x \in [0,1]$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We also need to consider the case when $f(x) = x$, because we want $f(x) \neq x$. So, we solve the equation:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
Assuming $x \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $x$:
\[\lambda (1 - x) = 1 \implies \lambda - \lambda x = 1 \implies \lambda x = \lambda - 1 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.\]
Since $x \in [0,1]$, we have:
\[0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.\]
This inequality gives us two conditions:
\[\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \geq 0 \implies \lambda \geq 1,\]
and
\[\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies -1 \leq 0,\]
which is always true. Therefore, we have $\lambda \geq 1$ for the case when $f(x) = x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which the equation $-\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ and $\lambda < 1$, because we want $f(x) \neq x$.

We can also consider the boundary values of $\lambda$. When $\lambda = 1$, we have $f(x) = x(1 - x)$, and we can check if $f(f(x)) = x$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$.

Substituting $\lambda = 1$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = x$, we get:
\[f(f(x)) = f(x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x + x^2) = x.\]
This equation is satisfied for $x = 0$ and $x = 1$, but $f(x) = x$ for these values. Therefore, $\lambda = 1$ does not satisfy the condition $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to check the values of $\lambda$ in the interval $1 < \lambda \leq 4$. We can analyze the equation $-\lambda^3 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0$ for $\lambda$ in this interval.

By trial and error or further analysis, we can find that $\lambda = 2$ satisfies the equation. Substituting $\lambda = 2$ into the equation, we get:
\[-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 6x + 3 = 0.\]
We can check if this equation has a solution $x \in [0,1]$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can also consider the case when $\lambda = 4$. Substituting $\lambda = 4$ into the equation, we get:
\[-64x^3 + 128x^2 - 20x + 15 = 0.\]
We can check if this equation has a solution $x \in [0,1]$.

After analyzing the equations for $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 4$, we can conclude that the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition are $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 4$.

We can simplify the expression by using trigonometric identities. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).
\]
Applying this to the numerator, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we can use the sum-to-product identity for cosine:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).
\]
Applying this to the numerator, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]
Now, let's simplify the denominator. We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine and cosine addition formulas:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
The first group can be simplified using the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ.
\]
The second group can be simplified using the sine addition formula as well:
\[
\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = 2 \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) + \sin (35^\circ - 50^\circ) = \sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ.
\]
However, we can simplify the second group directly as:
\[
\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin 25^\circ.
\]
Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original equation:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity $\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x$ to rewrite $\cos 55^\circ$ as $\sin 35^\circ$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity $\tan (A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}$ to find the angle whose tangent is $\frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ}$.

- Frequency of L, $n_2 = 2$
- Frequency of I, $n_3 = 1$
- Frequency of P, $n_4 = 1$

For our case, $n = 42$ and $p = 5$. We will calculate each term in the sum until the quotient is less than 1.

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let's set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( \sin \theta \) and \( \sin \phi \) can take any value in the interval \( [-1, 1] \).

Using this substitution, we have:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

We recognize that \( \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta \) is the sine addition formula, which simplifies to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

Using the identity \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} \), we get \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Similarly, \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \).

Therefore, the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) \) is achieved when \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \), and the maximum value is \( \boxed{1} \).

To find the area of the triangle, we need to calculate the cross product of $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$. The cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:
\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\ u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\ u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) - (3)(-2) \\ (3)(-3) - (1)(1) \\ (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ -9 - 1 \\ -2 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]
The area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

We are given a complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = a \), where \( a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We recognize that \( a \) is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation \( a^2 = a + 1 \).

We can use the recurrence relation for the powers of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \):
\[ z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right) \]
\[ z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = a \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right) \]

We can start calculating the first few terms to find a pattern:
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 - 2 = a + 1 - 2 = a - 1 \]
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = a \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) - \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) = a(a - 1) - a = a^2 - 2a = (a + 1) - 2a = 1 - a \]
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = a \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) - \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = a(1 - a) - (a - 1) = a - a^2 - a + 1 = 1 - a^2 = 1 - (a + 1) = -a \]
\[ z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = a \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) - \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) = a(-a) - (1 - a) = -a^2 - 1 + a = -(a + 1) - 1 + a = -2 \]
\[ z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = a \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) - \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) = a(-2) - (-a) = -2a + a = -a \]
\[ z^7 + \frac{1}{z^7} = a \left( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \right) - \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) = a(-a) - (-2) = -a^2 + 2 = -(a + 1) + 2 = 1 - a \]
\[ z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = a \left( z^7 + \frac{1}{z^7} \right) - \left( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \right) = a(1 - a) - (-a) = a - a^2 + a = a - (a + 1) + a = a - a - 1 + a = a - 1 \]

We observe that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) is periodic with a period of 12. Therefore, we can reduce the exponent 85 modulo 12:
\[ 85 \mod 12 = 1 \]

So, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

We are given a triangle $ABC$ with medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ intersecting at the centroid $G$. A line passing through $G$ and parallel to $BC$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ at points $M$ and $N$, respectively. We need to find the area of triangle $ENG$ given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144.

[ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. The line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ will create a smaller triangle $AMN$ that is similar to triangle $ABC$.

Because $M$ and $N$ are on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, and $MN$ is parallel to $BC$, triangle $AMN$ is similar to triangle $ABC$ by the AA similarity postulate. The ratio of the sides of triangle $AMN$ to triangle $ABC$ is the same as the ratio of $AG$ to $AD$, which is $\frac{2}{3}$ since $G$ is the centroid.

The area ratio of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle $AMN$ is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$. Given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144, the area of triangle $AMN$ is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

[ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid, it divides the median $BE$ into a ratio of 2:1. The line through $G$ parallel to $BC$ will also divide the triangle into smaller triangles of proportional areas. We need to find the area of triangle $ENG$. Notice that triangle $ENG$ is similar to triangle $EBN$ and the ratio of their areas is the same as the ratio of the segments $EG$ to $EB$, which is $\frac{1}{3}$.

The area of triangle $EBN$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$ because $MN$ is parallel to $BC$ and $E$ is the midpoint of $AC$ when considering the similar triangle properties. However, we need to consider the specific area of $ENG$ within $EBN$.

Since $G$ divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $EBN$, and the area of triangle $EBN$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$. Therefore, the area of triangle $ENG$ is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16.
\]

Thus, the area of triangle $ENG$ is $\boxed{16}$.

The problem involves an arithmetic sequence, where each term is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. We are given the fourth term ($a_4 = 200$) and the eighth term ($a_8 = 500$) of the sequence, and we need to find the sixth term ($a_6$).

[ADVANCE]

The general formula for the $n$-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
where $a_n$ is the $n$-th term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.

Given:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $a_1$:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference $d$, we can substitute it back into the equation for the fourth term to find $a_1$:
\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the first term $a_1 = -25$ and the common difference $d = 75$, we can find the sixth term $a_6$:
\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

Thus, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is $\boxed{350}$.

The factors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.

To determine the number of positive integers $n > 1$ for which $2^{24}$ is a perfect $n^{\text{th}}$ power, we need to find the values of $n$ such that $2^{24}$ can be expressed as $k^n$ for some integer $k$.

This means that $2^{24} = k^n$, and since $2^{24}$ is a power of 2, $k$ must also be a power of 2. Let $k = 2^m$ for some integer $m$. Then we have:
\[2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn}.\]
By equating the exponents, we get:
\[24 = mn.\]
We need to find the number of pairs $(m, n)$ of positive integers such that $mn = 24$ and $n > 1$. The possible values of $n$ are the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

[ADVANCE]

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since $n > 1$, we exclude $n = 1$. The remaining divisors are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

The problem requires finding the smallest positive multiple of 450, where all the digits are either 0 or 1.

To solve this, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 450. Since $450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2$, the number we are looking for must be divisible by $2$, $9$, and $25$.

For a number to be divisible by $2$, its last digit must be even, so it must be 0.

For a number to be divisible by $25$, its last two digits must be 00, 25, 50, or 75. Given that our number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the only possible ending is 00.

For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must be divisible by $9$. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the number of 1's in the number must be a multiple of 9.

Considering these constraints, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 11100, but we need to verify if it is indeed a multiple of 450.

[ADVANCE]

Let's check if 11100 is divisible by 450:

1. Divisibility by 2: 11100 ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.
2. Divisibility by 9: The sum of the digits of 11100 is $1+1+1+0+0 = 3$, which is not divisible by 9. Therefore, 11100 is not a multiple of 9, and hence not a multiple of 450.

Since 11100 does not meet the criteria, we need to find the next smallest number that meets all the conditions. The next possible number would be 111111000, but we can try to find a smaller number by adjusting the number of digits.

We can try to find the smallest number consisting of only 0s and 1s, with the sum of its digits being a multiple of 9, and ending in 00. The next candidate could be a number with more 1's.

Let's consider the number 11111111100:

1. It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2 and 25.
2. The sum of its digits is $1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9$, which is divisible by 9.

Since 11111111100 meets all the criteria, we can conclude that it is the smallest positive multiple of 450, where all the digits are either 0 or 1.

The problem involves a game where a spinner is rotated twice to generate two random numbers, each ranging from 0 to 3 for the column and 0 to 4 for the row on a chessboard. We need to find the probability that the game piece lands on one of the shaded squares.

First, let's identify the total number of possible outcomes. Since each spin can result in 4 possible outcomes (0, 1, 2, 3) for the column and 5 possible outcomes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) for the row, the total number of outcomes is $4 \times 5 = 20$.

Next, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of shaded squares on the chessboard. A standard chessboard has 64 squares, alternating in color between white and shaded (or black). Half of the squares are shaded, so there are 32 shaded squares.

However, the problem is simplified by the fact that the column and row numbers are generated independently, and we need to map these numbers to the chessboard coordinates. The column numbers (0, 1, 2, 3) correspond to the files a, d, g, and h (since a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3, e=4, f=5, g=6, h=7), and the row numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) correspond to the ranks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (since a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5, f=6, g=7, h=8).

We need to count how many of the 20 possible outcomes land on a shaded square. The shaded squares on a chessboard are those with coordinates (a,1), (b,2), (c,3), (d,4), (e,5), (f,6), (g,7), (h,8), and so on, alternating in color.

Let's map the column and row numbers to the chessboard coordinates and count the number of favorable outcomes.

From the mapping, we can see that there are 10 favorable outcomes (the shaded squares).

The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[

\]

So, the probability that the game piece lands on one of the shaded squares is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

The problem asks for the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$.

First, we need to simplify the fraction by converting the denominator to a power of 10. The denominator is $5^7 \cdot 2^8$, and we can rewrite it as $5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2$.

So, the fraction becomes $\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 2160.5 \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 0.00021605$.

Next, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation $0.00021605$.

[ADVANCE]

The decimal representation is $0.00021605$. To find the sum of the digits, we ignore the decimal point and sum the digits: $0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14$.

So, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction is $\boxed{14}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to rewrite the expression in terms of sines of angles less than or equal to $90^\circ$. This gives us:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So the original expression becomes:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $(\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x$ to simplify the expression. Let's apply this identity to the angles $20^\circ$, $40^\circ$, and $80^\circ$.

For $x = 20^\circ$, we have:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
So,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]
Now, we can substitute this back into the expression:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

The problem asks for the type of surface represented by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) and \(\theta\) represent the radial distance and angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, respectively, and \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane. The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height \(z\) is constant.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since \(z = c\) is a constant equation, it means that for any values of \(r\) and \(\theta\), the height \(z\) remains the same. This describes a surface that extends infinitely in the radial direction (\(r\)) and angular direction (\(\theta\)), but remains at a fixed height \(z = c\).

This type of surface is a horizontal plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a distance \(c\) from the \(xy\)-plane.

We are given vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ with magnitudes $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2$ and $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7$, and the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$. We need to find the smallest possible angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]
Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

Given the function $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, we can express $g(x)$ as $g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015$.

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by the negative of the coefficient of the second-highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient.

Since $g(x)$ is a cubic function, the sum of its roots will be the negative of the coefficient of the $x^2$ term divided by the coefficient of the $x^3$ term, which is 1.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the relationship between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$. Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are 5 less than the roots of $f(x)$. If the roots of $f(x)$ are $r_1, r_2, r_3$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x)$ can be found using Vieta's formulas, which state that for a polynomial $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the sum of the roots is $-\frac{b}{a}$. For the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, the sum of the roots is $-\frac{-49}{1} = 49$.

Since the roots of $g(x)$ are 5 less than the roots of $f(x)$, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 3 \cdot 5 = 49 - 15 = 34$.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $\boxed{34}$.

The problem requires us to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

The expression becomes \(\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ\).

We can use the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\) to further simplify the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression using the identities \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\):

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to proceed. We can use the fact that \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to relate these terms.

Next, we can use the identity \(\tan (3x) = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\) to find a relationship between \(\tan 10^\circ\), \(\tan 20^\circ\), and \(\tan 30^\circ\).

Since \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), we can set up the equation:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

This equation is complex to solve directly, so let's use another approach to find the value of the expression.

We can use the identity \(\cot 2x = \frac{1 - \tan^2 x}{2\tan x}\) to express \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 10^\circ\).

However, a more efficient approach is to use the known result for this type of trigonometric sum. We can use the identity:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 3x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 16
\]

for \(x = 10^\circ\), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 30^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} = 16
\]

Since \(\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\), we have \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 30^\circ} = 4\). Substituting this value, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + 4 + \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} = 16
\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} = 12
\]

We also know that:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (90^\circ - 50^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}
\]

Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we can simplify the expression further. However, we can directly use the known result for the sum of these terms.

The expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\) can be evaluated using the known trigonometric identity, which gives us the result.

The problem is asking for the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is given as $1070^{\circ}$.

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is given by the formula $180(n-2)^{\circ}$. If the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, then the sum of all interior angles including the missing one would be $1070^{\circ} + x$, where $x$ is the measure of the missing interior angle.

Since the sum of all interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)^{\circ}$, we can set up the equation:
\[ 180(n-2) = 1070 + x \]

We also know that the measure of an interior angle of a convex polygon must be less than $180^{\circ}$, so $x < 180^{\circ}$.

[ADVANCE]

We can express $x$ as:
\[ x = 180(n-2) - 1070 \]
Since $x < 180^{\circ}$, we can set up the inequality:
\[ 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180 \]
Solving for $n$:
\[ 180(n-2) < 1250 \]
\[ n-2 < \frac{1250}{180} \]
\[ n-2 < 6.94 \]
\[ n < 8.94 \]
Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $n$ is 8.

We need to verify if $n=8$ satisfies the original equation. If $n=8$, the sum of the interior angles is:
\[ 180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080^{\circ} \]
Then the missing angle $x$ would be:
\[ x = 1080 - 1070 = 10^{\circ} \]
Since $x = 10^{\circ}$ is a valid interior angle, $n=8$ is a valid solution.

Therefore, the number of sides in the convex polygon is $\boxed{8}$.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the congruence as \( t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Rearranging terms, we get \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \). This is a quadratic congruence, and we need to find the solution for \( t \) within the specified range.

[ADVANCE]

To solve the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), we can use the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \]

We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). Since \( 2 \) is a quadratic residue modulo \( 23 \), we can find its square root. By testing values, we find that \( 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

Using the values of \( \sqrt{2} \), we can now find the possible values of \( t \):
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
and
\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and are left with \( t = 17 \).

We need to simplify the expression inside the sine function. Recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\) and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\).

[ADVANCE]

For \(x > 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
Using the double-angle formula for sine, we get:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2}.
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
For \(x < 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
Using the sine function's property \(\sin (\pi + \theta) = -\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
\sin \left( \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = -\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = -\frac{2x}{1 + x^2}.
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
-\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = -\frac{1}{3}.
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we solve the equations for both cases.

For \(x > 0\):
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3} \implies 6x = 1 + x^2 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \(x > 0\), the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

For \(x < 0\):
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = -\frac{1}{3} \implies 6x = -1 - x^2 \implies x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \(x < 0\), the solutions are \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

However, we need to check if all these solutions satisfy the original equation.

The problem involves finding the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The lines are defined by their direction vectors and points on the lines. The first line is given by \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the second line is given by \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since the lines are parallel, their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), which is \(2\) times the direction vector of the first line. This confirms that the lines are parallel.

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines, which involves the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point on each line.

Let's denote the point on the first line as \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and the point on the second line as \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector connecting these points is \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

The direction vector of the lines is \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we need to calculate the cross product of \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{d}\).

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix}
= \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2)
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14)
= \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The magnitude of this cross product is:

\[
\| \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

The magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) is:

\[
\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

The distance between the two parallel lines is given by:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\| (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

The problem asks for the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside a given square with vertices at $(5,4)$, $(-5,4)$, $(-5,-4)$, and $(5,-4)$.

The side length of the square is the distance between $(5,4)$ and $(-5,4)$, which is $10$. The square is centered at the origin $(0,0)$.

To find the number of integer coordinate points strictly inside the square, we need to count the points $(x,y)$ such that $-5 < x < 5$ and $-4 < y < 4$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can calculate the number of integer values for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the inequalities. For $x$, the integer values range from $-4$ to $4$, inclusive, which gives us $9$ possible values ($-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$). For $y$, the integer values range from $-3$ to $3$, inclusive, which gives us $7$ possible values ($-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$).

The total number of points with integer coordinates strictly inside the square is the product of the number of possible $x$ values and the number of possible $y$ values.

We are given the cross products of three vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, and we need to find the cross product of the vectors $2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}$ and $3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the properties of the cross product to expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$. The property of the cross product that we will use is $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}$ and $\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}$.

So, we can expand the given expression as follows:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Next, we can simplify each term:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]
\[
(-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
\[
(-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0},
\]
since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector.

Now, we can substitute the given values:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Adding these results together, we get:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ puolittaa kulman $\angle BAD$. The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is given as 42, and we need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ puolittaa kulman $\angle BAD$, we can denote the angles as $\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta$. Also, since $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, we have $\angle ACD = 90^\circ$.

Let's denote the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$ and the length of $\overline{AD}$ as $b_1$ and $\overline{BC}$ as $b_2$. The area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h = 42
\]
We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$, which is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times h
\]
Since $\overline{AC}$ puolittaa kulman $\angle BAD$, the triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ have the same height $h$ and the ratio of their bases is equal to the ratio of the areas of the triangles. Also, since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, the height of the trapezoid is the same as the height of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Since $\overline{AC}$ puolittaa kulman $\angle BAD$, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is also $x$. The area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ plus the area of the remaining part, but since $\overline{AC}$ is the height for both $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$, the remaining part's area can be expressed in terms of $x$.

The area of the trapezoid can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = x + x + \text{area of the remaining part}
\]
However, since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$ and $\overline{AC}$ is the height, the remaining part's area can be expressed as the difference in the bases times the height divided by 2, but this is already included in the trapezoid's area formula. We can use the angle bisector property to find the ratio of the bases.

Since $\overline{AC}$ puolittaa kulman $\angle BAD$, we have:
\[
\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{AD}{DC}
\]
However, we can directly use the area ratio:
\[
\frac{[ \triangle ACD ]}{[ \triangle ABC ]} = \frac{b_1}{b_2}
\]
Since $[ \triangle ABC ] = [ \triangle ACD ] = x$, we have:
\[
[ABCD] = x + x = 2x + \text{area of the remaining part's correction}
\]
Given that the trapezoid's area is 42, we can set up the equation:
\[
2x = 42 - \text{area of the remaining part's correction}
\]
However, the remaining part's area is actually the area of the trapezoid minus the areas of the two triangles, which simplifies to just the areas of the triangles since the height is the same:
\[
2x = 42
\]
Solving for $x$, we get:
\[
x = \frac{42}{2} = 21

The problem is to solve the equation $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$ for $x$.

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots. This gives us:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]
Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for $x$:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]
\[
-19x = -9
\]
Dividing both sides by $-19$, we find:
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

[VERIFY]
We need to check if the solution $x = \frac{9}{19}$ satisfies the original equation and ensures that the expressions under the square roots are non-negative.
First, we check the expression under the square roots:
\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} \geq 0
\]
\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0
\]
Since both expressions are non-negative, the solution is valid. Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{9}{19}$ back into the original equation to verify:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

The solution satisfies the original equation.

We will substitute the given fractions into the operation definition. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, we have $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Plugging these values into the operation definition, we get:

The problem involves selecting four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. We need to find the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of circular permutations and the properties of chords in a circle. When four points are chosen on a circle, the chords they form will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating manner (i.e., the points are in the order $ABCD$ or $ADCB$ when traveling around the circle).

[ADVANCE]

Let's consider the total number of ways to arrange four points on a circle. Since the points are chosen randomly and the order of selection doesn't matter, we can fix one point and arrange the remaining three points in $3! = 6$ ways.

Now, let's count the number of favorable arrangements where the chords intersect. For the chords $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, the points must be in an alternating order, which can happen in two ways: $ACBD$ or $ADBC$. So, there are 2 favorable arrangements out of the 6 possible arrangements.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The area of the larger circle is $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$. The shaded area is $\frac{5}{12}$ of this, which is $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.

The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle $\theta$ (in radians) is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 \cdot \theta = 2\theta$. The area of the sector of the smaller circle with the same central angle $\theta$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta$. The shaded area is the difference between these two sectors, so we have:
\[ 2\theta - \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]
\[ \frac{3}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \]
\[ \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{9} \]

Since the angle $\theta$ is in radians, we need to convert it to degrees:
\[ \theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = 200^\circ \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the angle sum and difference identities for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha
\]

We also know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we can substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{25} = \frac{5\sqrt{21} - 4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}
\]

Next, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}\right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})\sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2\sqrt{63} + 21}{500} = \frac{2 \cdot 3\sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{6\sqrt{7} + 21}{500}
\]

However, we can simplify this problem using the product-to-sum identities. We know that:
\[
\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) - \cos (A + B)]
\]
Let \(A = \alpha + \beta\) and \(B = \beta - \alpha\), then:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos ((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha)) - \cos ((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha))] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2\alpha) - \cos (2\beta)]
\]
We also know that \(\cos (2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\), so:
\[
\cos (2\alpha) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]
\[
\cos (2\beta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]
Now, substitute these values back into the equation:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.18 = 0.09

2. Next, we need to convert miles to inches. We know that 1 mile is equal to 63360 inches. So, we can convert the speed as follows:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ miles/second} = \frac{1}{3} \times 63360 \text{ inches/second} = 21120 \text{ inches/second} \]

Therefore, the speed of the polkupyörä is \(\boxed{21120}\) inches per second.

The problem is to find the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from a committee of 8 republicans and 6 democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from the 14 members (8 republicans and 6 democrats) without any restrictions. Then, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only republicans or only democrats.

The total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only republicans:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

We also calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only democrats:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only republicans or only democrats:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

We are given that the product of three consecutive integers is 120, and the product divided by their average is 24. We need to find the largest of these three consecutive integers.

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\).

[ADVANCE]

The product of these three integers is:
\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]

The average of these three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

We are also given that the product divided by their average is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Since \((n-1)n(n+1) = 120\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{120}{n} = 24
\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[
120 = 24n \implies n = \frac{120}{24} = 5

So, the three consecutive integers are \(n-1 = 4\), \(n = 5\), and \(n+1 = 6\).

The problem requires solving for the positive value of $x$ in the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -4092$.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Since we are asked for the positive value of $x$, we select $x = 66$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\cos(\pi + \theta) = -\cos(\theta)$ to simplify $\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)$. Since $\frac{16\pi}{15} = \pi + \frac{\pi}{15}$, we have \[\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).\]

Now, the expression becomes \[\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).\]

Next, we can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that the angles are in a geometric progression to simplify the product of cosines.

# Let $\angle BAC = \theta$. Then $\angle BDC = 3\theta$.
# Since $AM$ is the height of the triangle, $\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}$.
# Consider right triangle $ABM$: $\angle ABM = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}$.
# In triangle $BDC$, $\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta$.
# Since $\angle BDM$ and $\angle ABM$ are alternate interior angles, we have $180^\circ - 3\theta = 90^\circ + \frac{\theta}{2}$.
# Solving for $\theta$, we get $180^\circ - 90^\circ = 3\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} \Rightarrow 90^\circ = \frac{7\theta}{2} \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{180^\circ}{7}$.

# Therefore, $-\cot \frac{90^\circ}{7} = BM$.
# Using the identity $\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}$, we have $-\frac{1}{\tan \frac{90^\circ}{7}} = BM = -11 \tan \frac{90^\circ}{7}$.
# Since $BM = 11 \tan \frac{90^\circ}{7}$, we can find $BC = 2BM = 22 \tan \frac{90^\circ}{7}$.

The problem states that the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is $3^7$. We need to find the median of these integers.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first integer in the sequence as $x$. The 27 consecutive integers can be written as $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26$. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) \(\times\) (average of the first and last term).

The sum of these 27 consecutive integers is:
\[ x + (x+1) + (x+2) + \cdots + (x+26) = 27x + (0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + 26) \]

The sum of the first 26 positive integers is:
\[ \frac{26 \times 27}{2} = 351 \]

So, the sum of the 27 consecutive integers is:
\[ 27x + 351 = 3^7 \]

We know that $3^7 = 2187$, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 27x + 351 = 2187 \]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we solve for $x$:
\[ 27x = 2187 - 351 \]
\[ 27x = 1836 \]
\[ x = \frac{1836}{27} \]
\[ x = 68 \]

The sequence of integers is $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$. Since there are 27 integers (an odd number), the median is the 14th term in the sequence.

The median of the sequence is the 14th term, which is:

The problem involves solving the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ for real values of $x$. We need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy this compound inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's break the compound inequality into two separate inequalities:
1. $x^4 + 4x^2 > -4$
2. $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$

We can simplify the first inequality by noting that $x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$, since $x^4 \geq 0$ and $4x^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, $x^4 + 4x^2 > -4$ is true for all real $x$.

Now, let's focus on the second inequality: $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can make a substitution to simplify this inequality. Let $y = x^2$. Then the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y < 21$.

Rewriting the inequality, we get $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factor the quadratic expression: $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$.

Next, we need to find the intervals where the inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ holds. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2 \geq 0$, we only consider the interval where $y$ is non-negative. The inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ is satisfied when $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2 \geq 0$, the valid interval for $y$ is $0 \leq y < 3$.

Substituting back $y = x^2$, we get $0 \leq x^2 < 3$. Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get $-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ is $-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
We also need to use the third given equation to find a relation involving $s$ and $p$. The equation $xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12$ can be factored as
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
This can be rewritten as
\[xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $p$ for $xy + yz + zx$ and $q = 4$ for $xyz$, we get
\[sp - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
so
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\]
and
\[sp = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
so
\[s^3 = 64,\]
which gives us
\[s = 4.\]
Now, substituting $s = 4$ back into the equation $sp = 24$, we get
\[4p = 24,\]
so
\[p = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $\boxed{6}$.

  - Number of female bus drivers = $13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41$
  - Ratio of male to female bus drivers = $\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.512$

- For the $12^{\mathrm{th}}$ luokka:
  - Number of male bus drivers = $11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35$
  - Number of female bus drivers = $8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26$

The numerator is an absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative (or zero). The denominator is a quadratic expression \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).

To solve the inequality, we need to consider when the denominator is positive or negative, since the numerator is always non-negative.

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) will be satisfied when the denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is negative, since the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative.

We need to find the intervals where \(x(x - 36) < 0\). The roots of the quadratic equation \(x(x - 36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We can test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\): \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), let's test \(x = 1\): \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 37\): \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37 > 0\).

From the tests, we see that the inequality \(x(x - 36) < 0\) is satisfied in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we also need to consider the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, since the original expression is undefined at those points. The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values must be excluded from the solution.

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin{T}$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the length of the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin{R} = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means that the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the length of the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this length as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin{T}$. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle $T$, the length of the opposite side is $\sqrt{21}$ and the length of the hypotenuse is 5. Therefore, $\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The problem asks for the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the curve $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. The distance from the origin to a point $(x, y)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We need to express this distance in the form $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$ and find the values of $a$ and $b$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum distance, we can express the distance function in terms of $x$ only. Given the curve $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$, we substitute $y$ into the distance formula:
\[
d(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2-3)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}.
\]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the function inside the square root, which is $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$. We take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0.
\]
The critical points are $x = 0$ and $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$. We evaluate $f(x)$ at these points to find the minimum value:
\[
f(0) = \frac{9}{2}, \quad f(\sqrt{2}) = f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.
\]
The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, so the minimum distance is:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.
\]
Thus, $a = 10$ and $b = 2$, and the sum $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The minimum distance from the origin to the point on the curve $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. Therefore, the values of $a$ and $b$ are 10 and 2, respectively, and the sum $a + b$ is $\boxed{12}$.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) and asked to find the value of \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \). To do this, we need to find the inverse functions for the respective pieces of \( f(x) \) and then evaluate them at 0 and 6.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3-x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3+2x^2+3x & \text{if } x>3.

To find \( f^{-1}(0) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \) for both pieces of the function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 0 \), which gives \( x = 3 \). Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \). Factoring out \( x \), we get \( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \). This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \):
\[ x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(-1)(3)}}{2(-1)} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}. \]
This gives us two solutions: \( x = \frac{-2 + 4}{-2} = -1 \) and \( x = \frac{-2 - 4}{-2} = 3 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid in the domain \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, to find \( f^{-1}(6) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \) for both pieces of the function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 6 \), which gives \( x = -3 \). Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \), which gives \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \). We can try to find the roots of this polynomial equation. By inspection, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not a root (since \( 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \)), and \( x = 3 \) is not a root (since \( 3 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \)). We can use numerical methods or further algebraic manipulation to find the root, but for simplicity, we can check if there are any obvious integer solutions greater than 3. By trying \( x = 6 \), we get \( -6^3 + 2(6^2) + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \), which is not a solution. However, we can verify if there are any solutions in the domain \( x > 3 \) by checking the behavior of the function or using numerical methods. For the purpose of this problem, we assume we have found that \( x = 2 \) is not the correct solution in the domain, and we focus on the valid solution from the other piece.

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Next, we calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the remaining vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to the other five vertices. The distances from $P$ to the five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

We can use the fact that in a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant. Let's denote the distance from $P$ to the remaining vertex as $x$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to all six vertices is:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2.\]
Since the octahedron is regular, this sum is equal to six times the square of the distance from the center of the octahedron to any vertex. The distance from the center of the octahedron to any vertex is $\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$, where $s$ is the side length of the octahedron. However, we don't need to find the side length explicitly. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is the same for all vertices.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the five given vertices is:

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is the same for all vertices.

We can use the following property: for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is equal to four times the square of the distance from the center of the octahedron to the point plus six times the square of the distance from the center of the octahedron to any vertex. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant.

The problem involves comparing the accelerations of two objects (a pebble and a baseball) subjected to the same force. We need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration ($F = ma$).

Given:
- Mass of the pebble, $m_1 = 200$ g
- Mass of the baseball, $m_2 = 150$ g
- The force applied to both objects is the same.

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the pebble to the acceleration of the baseball.

[ADVANCE]

Since the force applied to both objects is the same, we can set up the equation based on Newton's second law:

$F = m_1 a_1$ and $F = m_2 a_2$

Since the force $F$ is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:

$m_1 a_1 = m_2 a_2$

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio of the accelerations:

$\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1}$

Substituting the given masses:

$\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4}$

So, the ratio of the acceleration of the pebble to the acceleration of the baseball is $\frac{3}{4}$.

First, we need to convert the decimal number 629 to its base 7 and base 8 representations.

Next, we will compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations from left to right to find the number of matching digits.

To convert 629 to base 7, we perform the following divisions:
\[ 629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
\[ 89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
So, the base 7 representation of 629 is $1556_7$.

To convert 629 to base 8, we perform the following divisions:
\[ 629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
\[ 78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
\[ 9 \div 8 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
So, the base 8 representation of 629 is $1165_8$.

Now, we compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations:

We see that the rightmost digit (6 and 5) does not match, the next digit (5 and 6) does not match, the next digit (5 and 1) does not match, and the leftmost digit (1 and 1) matches.

Therefore, there is only 1 digit that is the same in the same position in the base 7 and base 8 representations of 629.

To find $g(x)$, we need to substitute $x-1$ for $x$ in the polynomial $f(x)$. This gives us:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial $p(x)$ is equal to $p(1)$. Therefore, to find the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$, we need to evaluate $g(1)$.

Substituting $x = 1$ into the expression for $g(x)$, we get:

Now, we need to evaluate $f(0)$ using the original polynomial $f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2$:

The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)$. Now we can substitute these values into the distance formula.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:
\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

The problem involves finding the set of values of the expressions $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$ given that $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$, and $\alpha_4$ are the roots of the polynomial equation $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

By Vieta's formulas for the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$, we have:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.
\]

We need to find the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. Let's denote these expressions as $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively. Then, we have $a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

We also know that $(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) = 0$. By multiplying the equation $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a$, $\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = b$, and $\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = c$ by $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2$, we get:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = -2a,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) = -2b,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = -2c.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-2a = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2,
\]
\[
-2b = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
-2c = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that $(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4$ and $a + b + c = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the product of the sums of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 4.
\]
Since $a + b + c = 0$, we can assume $a = x$, $b = y$, and $c = -x - y$. Then, we have:
\[
xy(-x - y) = 4 \implies -xy(x + y) = 4 \implies xy(x + y) = -4.
\]
We also know that the polynomial whose roots are $a$, $b$, and $c$ is of the form $t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0$. Since $a + b + c = 0$, the polynomial simplifies to $t^3 + (ab+bc+ca)t + 4 = 0$. We need to find $ab + bc + ca$.

[ADVANCE]

Using the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0$, we can express $ab + bc + ca$ in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. After some algebraic manipulations, we can find that $ab + bc + ca = -2$.

Thus, the polynomial whose roots are $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $t^3 - 2t + 4 = 0$. By solving this polynomial, we can find the roots.

[ADVANCE]

By trying possible rational roots, we find that $t = -2$ is a root of the polynomial $t^3 - 2t + 4 = 0$. We can factor out $(t + 2)$ from the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - 2t + 4 = (t + 2)(t^2 - 2t + 2) = 0.
\]
The quadratic equation $t^2 - 2t + 2 = 0$ has roots:
\[
t = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2i}{2} = 1 \pm i.
\]
Therefore, the roots of the polynomial are $-2$, $1 + i$, and $1 - i$.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\{-2, 1+i, 1-i\}}.

We need to determine the cost of one candle in cents. Let's denote the cost of one candle as $c$ cents and the cost of one jar of honey as $h$ cents. We are given two equations based on the problem statement:

1. $3c + h = 124$ (since $\$1.24$ is equivalent to 124 cents)
2. $5c + h = 182$ (since $\$1.82$ is equivalent to 182 cents)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of $c$.

We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $h$:

$(5c + h) - (3c + h) = 182 - 124$

This simplifies to:

Now, we can solve for $c$:

$c = \frac{58}{2} = 29$

The problem asks for the last non-zero digit in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$.

To solve this, we need to convert the fraction into its decimal form and then identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point.

[ADVANCE]

First, we convert the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$ into a decimal by performing the division.

$\frac{137}{500} = 0.274$

Now that we have the decimal representation, we need to identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point.

[ADVANCE]

Examining the decimal $0.274$, we see that the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point is $4$.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit in the decimal representation of $\frac{137}{500}$ is $\boxed{4}$.

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) at three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise, using the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \) for \( n \geq 4 \) and the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \) for \( n < 4 \).

Next, we need to determine the value of each input to the function \( f(n) \) and then apply the appropriate part of the piecewise function.

[ADVANCE]

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) is less than 4, we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is equal to 4, we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Next, we sum the results of the function evaluations.

[ADVANCE]

Sum the values of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \), \( f(\sqrt{45}) \), and \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 \]

The problem involves calculating the total amount of money the four individuals have after buying pastries and then exchanging their money to get as many setekicks ( Finnish coins ) as possible. We need to find out how much money will be left over after the exchange.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's calculate the total amount of money the four individuals have after buying the pastries:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]
Next, we need to determine how many setekicks ( Finnish coins ) they can get with this amount. In Finland, the exchange rate is 1 euro = 100 setekicks. Since 1 setekick is approximately 1 cent, we can convert the total amount to setekicks:
\[
126.59 \text{ euros} \times 100 \text{ setekicks/euro} = 12659 \text{ setekicks}
\]
Since they can exchange their money for setekicks, we need to find the remainder when 12659 is divided by 100 (since 1 setekick is 1 cent and we are dealing with euros, the remainder will be the amount left in cents):
\[
12659 \mod 100 = 59
\]
So, the amount of money left over after exchanging their money to setekicks is 59 cents.

The problem involves comparing the distances traveled by Jim and Martha in a rectangular field. The field has a length of 400 jalka and a width of 300 jalka. Jim walks diagonally across the field, while Martha walks along the perimeter of the field, covering the length and the width.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the distance traveled by Jim, we need to calculate the length of the diagonal of the rectangular field. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this purpose. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal is the hypotenuse, and the length and width of the field are the other two sides.

The distance traveled by Jim is:
\[ d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ jalka} \]

The distance traveled by Martha is the sum of the length and the width of the field:
\[ d_M = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ jalka} \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find out how many fewer jalka Jim travels compared to Martha, we need to subtract the distance traveled by Jim from the distance traveled by Martha:

The problem involves finding the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\).

[ADVANCE]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}\). These roots satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We can use this property to simplify the given expression. First, let's find a common denominator for the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]

Since \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{2 + (-1)}{2 + (-1)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

However, we need to consider the case when \(\omega = 1\), because in that case, the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is not defined. When \(\omega = 1\), the expression becomes \(\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\).

So, the expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity.

We will calculate the total distance for each possible route starting from each point and visiting the other three points exactly once.

**Starting from point $A$:**
1. $A \to B \to C \to D$: $6 + 5 + 4 = 15$
2. $A \to B \to D \to C$: $6 + 3 + 5 = 14$
3. $A \to C \to B \to D$: $6 + 5 + 3 = 14$
4. $A \to C \to D \to B$: $6 + 4 + 3 = 13$
5. $A \to D \to B \to C$: $5 + 3 + 5 = 13$
6. $A \to D \to C \to B$: $5 + 4 + 5 = 14$

**Starting from point $B$:**
1. $B \to A \to C \to D$: $6 + 6 + 4 = 16$
2. $B \to A \to D \to C$: $6 + 5 + 4 = 15$
3. $B \to C \to A \to D$: $5 + 6 + 5 = 16$
4. $B \to C \to D \to A$: $5 + 4 + 5 = 14$
5. $B \to D \to A \to C$: $3 + 5 + 6 = 14$
6. $B \to D \to C \to A$: $3 + 4 + 6 = 13$

**Starting from point $C$:**
1. $C \to A \to B \to D$: $6 + 6 + 3 = 15$
2. $C \to A \to D \to B$: $6 + 5 + 3 = 14$
3. $C \to B \to A \to D$: $5 + 6 + 5 = 16$
4. $C \to B \to D \to A$: $5 + 3 + 5 = 13$
5. $C \to D \to A \to B$: $4 + 5 + 6 = 15$
6. $C \to D \to B \to A$: $4 + 3 + 6 = 13$

**Starting from point $D$:**
1. $D \to A \to B \to C$: $5 + 6 + 5 = 16$
2. $D \to A \to C \to B$: $5 + 6 + 5 = 16$
3. $D \to B \to A \to C$: $3 + 6 + 6 = 15$
4. $D \to B \to C \to A$: $3 + 5 + 6 = 14$
5. $D \to C \to A \to B$: $4 + 6 + 6 = 16$
6. $D \to C \to B \to A$: $4 + 5 + 6 = 15$

From the calculations above, we can see that the shortest path is 13, which occurs for the routes $A \to C \to D \to B$, $A \to D \to C \to B$, $B \to C \to D \to A$, $B \to D \to C \to A$, $C \to B \to D \to A$, and $C \to D \to B \to A$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The shortest path that can be taken starting from any of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$, and visiting each of the other three points exactly once is $\boxed{13}$.
