We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) as 7. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can use the given value of $\sin D$ to find the length of $DF$. Let's denote the length of $DF$ as $x$. Then, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{x} = 0.7
\]
From this equation, we can solve for $x$:
\[
x = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now, we have the lengths of the two sides of the right triangle $DEF$: $EF = 7$ and $DF = 10$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse $DE$:
\[
DE = \sqrt{DF^2 - EF^2} = \sqrt{10^2 - 7^2} = \sqrt{100 - 49} = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

# The problem involves complex numbers and rotation in the complex plane.
# We are given $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$.
# We need to find the complex number $w$ such that $z$ is obtained by rotating $w$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians counterclockwise.
# The rotation of a complex number $a$ around another complex number $b$ by an angle $\theta$ can be represented as $a = b + (z - b)e^{i\theta}$, where $z$ is the original complex number and $a$ is the rotated complex number.

# To find $w$, we can use the rotation formula: $z = c + (w - c)e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$.
# We can rearrange the formula to solve for $w$: $w = c + \frac{z - c}{e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}}$.
# Since $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we have $\frac{1}{e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}} = \frac{1}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + i} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1 - i}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
# Now, we can substitute the values of $z$ and $c$ into the formula: $w = (2 - 3i) + \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (2 - 3i)\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$.
# Simplify the expression inside the parentheses: $z - c = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - 2 + 3i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i$.
# Substitute $z - c$ into the formula: $w = (2 - 3i) + (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$.
# Expand the product: $(\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 - i - 3i + 3i^2 = 1 - 4i - 3 = -2 - 4i$.
# Substitute the expanded product back into the formula: $w = (2 - 3i) + (-2 - 4i) = 2 - 2 - 3i - 4i = -7i$.
# The distance from $c$ to $w$ is the same as the distance from $c$ to $z$, since rotation is an isometry. We can calculate the distance from $c$ to $z$ using the modulus of the difference between $z$ and $c$: $|z - c| = |\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i| = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{2 + 18} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}$.

The problem asks for the simplification of $\sqrt{242}$. To simplify a square root, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of the number under the square root.

[ADVANCE]

We start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can divide 242 by 2, the smallest prime number, to get 121. Then, we recognize that 121 is a perfect square, specifically $11^2$. Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is $2 \times 11^2$.

Using the property of square roots that $\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}$, we can rewrite $\sqrt{242}$ as $\sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}$.

The problem asks us to expand the expression \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\) and find the term that is independent of \(x\).

To find the term independent of \(x\), we need to use the binomial theorem, which states that \((a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\). In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\).

The general term in the expansion is given by:
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]
Simplifying the general term, we get:
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k}
\]
\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be independent of \(x\), the exponent of \(x\) must be zero, i.e., \(15-5k = 0\). Solving for \(k\), we get:
\[
15-5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
So, the term independent of \(x\) is the term when \(k = 3\). Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]
\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]
\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \cdot 10

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot -\frac{10}{8}

\[
T_3 = -\frac{1000}{8}

\[
T_3 = -125

The problem states that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Given $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

Substituting $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we get:
\[ n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

So, we need to find the product:
\[ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 24 \pmod{7} \]

Now, we simplify $24 \pmod{7}$:
\[ 24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \]
So, $24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$.

The problem involves a circular rug that is being cut into pieces. The rug is circular, so we need to consider the geometry of the circle. The problem asks for the minimum number of straight cuts required to divide the rug into non-overlapping pieces that can fit into a square space without overlapping, where the square's side length is equal to the diameter of the rug.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to understand how the number of cuts relates to the number of pieces the rug can be divided into. Each cut can at most double the number of pieces. We need to find the minimum number of cuts required to divide the rug into pieces that can fit into a square space without overlapping.

Let's consider the maximum number of pieces that can fit into a square space. The square's side length is equal to the diameter of the rug, so the maximum number of pieces that can fit is equal to the number of pieces that can fit in a square with side length equal to the diameter of the rug.

If we make 1 cut, we get 2 pieces.
If we make 2 cuts, we get 4 pieces.
If we make 3 cuts, we get 8 pieces.
If we make 4 cuts, we get 16 pieces.

We need to find the minimum number of cuts required to divide the rug into pieces that can fit into the square space. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of pieces, we assume that the pieces need to be non-overlapping and fit within the square.

[SYNTHESIZE]

From the above steps, we can see that the number of pieces increases exponentially with each cut. We need to find the minimum number of cuts required to divide the rug into pieces that can fit into the square space. Since the square's side length is equal to the diameter of the rug, we can fit a maximum of 16 pieces (4x4) into the square space.

Therefore, the minimum number of cuts required to divide the rug into 16 pieces is 4.

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram, given the coordinates of the other three vertices. We can use the properties of a parallelogram to determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

The given vertices are $(5, 3)$, $(6, 8)$, $(7, 4)$, and $(x, y)$, with the condition that $x > 7$.

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the given vertices as $A(5, 3)$, $B(6, 8)$, $C(7, 4)$, and $D(x, y)$. The midpoint of diagonal $AC$ is equal to the midpoint of diagonal $BD$.

The midpoint of $AC$ is $\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)$.

The midpoint of $BD$ is $\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)$.

Since the midpoints are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 6$ is not a valid solution. Let's consider the other possible pair of vertices for the diagonals.

We can also consider $AB$ and $CD$ as the diagonals. The midpoint of $AB$ is $\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)$.

The midpoint of $CD$ is $\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)$.

Since the midpoints are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 4$ is not a valid solution. We need to consider the last possible pair of vertices for the diagonals.

We can also consider $AD$ and $BC$ as the diagonals. The midpoint of $AD$ is $\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)$.

The midpoint of $BC$ is $\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)$.

Since the midpoints are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for $y$:
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Since $x = 8 > 7$, this solution is valid. Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are $(8, 9)$.

Now, we can find the value of $x + y$:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

We know that in a right-angled triangle, $\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ and $\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. This simplifies to $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$.

We also know that $\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$. Using the relationship we found, $\tan A = \frac{2 \cdot \text{adjacent}}{\text{adjacent}} = 2$.

We have used the given relationship $\sin A = 2\cos A$ to find $\tan A$. This relationship is valid for a right-angled triangle, and we have correctly applied the trigonometric identities. The calculation $\tan A = \frac{2 \cdot \text{adjacent}}{\text{adjacent}} = 2$ is also correct.

The problem involves finding the asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \) and then calculating the sum of the asymptotes' values.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

[ADVANCE]

The sum of the values of the vertical asymptotes is:
\[ a + b = 7 + (-2) = 5. \]

To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to consider the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, the value of the horizontal asymptote is \( c = 0 \).

To approach this problem, we need to understand the effect of the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}$ on the vector $\bold{v}$. We can express $\bold{v}$ as $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ and then compute the product $\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v}$.

The product is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of this product is:
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We also need to consider the norm of the original vector $\bold{v}$, which is:
\[
\|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

The inequality we need to satisfy is:
\[
\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \le C \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

To find the smallest $C$, we can consider the ratio of the two norms and maximize it over all possible vectors $\bold{v}$. This can be done by expressing the ratio in terms of the unit vector $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$, i.e., $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.

Let's use Python and sympy to find the maximum value of the ratio.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# Define the expressions for the norms
norm_product = sp.sqrt(4*x**2 + 12*x*y + 13*y**2)
norm_v = sp.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Since we are looking for the maximum value of the ratio, we can consider the unit vector
# So, we set x^2 + y^2 = 1
ratio = norm_product / norm_v
ratio_simplified = ratio.subs(x**2 + y**2, 1)

# To find the maximum value, we can use calculus or directly find the eigenvalues of the matrix
# The maximum value of the ratio will be the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix A^T A
A = sp.Matrix([[2, 3], [0, -2]])

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express this equation as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. Factoring the left-hand side, we get $(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0$. Given that $z \neq 1$, it follows that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the equation $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ as $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1$. Dividing the entire equation by $z^2$ (since $z \neq 0$), we obtain $z^2 + z + 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^2} = 0$. Rearranging the terms, we have $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right) = -1$.

[ADVANCE]

Let $x = z + \frac{1}{z}$. Then, we can express $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$ in terms of $x$ as follows: $\left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)^2 = z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$, so $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = x^2 - 2$. Substituting this into the equation $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right) = -1$, we get $x^2 - 2 + x = -1$, which simplifies to $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

We can solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = -1$, so we have $x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $x = z + \frac{1}{z}$, we have $z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = x + (x^2 - 2) = x^2 + x - 2$. We already know that $x^2 + x = -1$, so $x^2 + x - 2 = -1 - 2 = -3$.

\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\), we can simplify the expression further:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

The problem involves determining the number of trees that have the same weight as a certain number of squigs and goolees. We are given the following information:
- The weight of three trees is equal to the weight of one squig and one goolee.
- The weight of two trees and one goolee is equal to the weight of one squig.
- We need to find the number of trees whose weight is equal to the weight of one squig.

Let's denote:
- The weight of one tree as $T$.
- The weight of one squig as $S$.
- The weight of one goolee as $G$.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. $3T = S + G$
2. $2T + G = S$

We need to find the number of trees whose weight is equal to the weight of one squig, i.e., we need to find $x$ such that $xT = S$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can use the given equations to express $S$ and $G$ in terms of $T$. First, we'll solve the second equation for $S$:
\[ S = 2T + G \]

Now, substitute this expression for $S$ into the first equation:
\[ 3T = (2T + G) + G \]
\[ 3T = 2T + 2G \]
\[ T = 2G \]
\[ G = \frac{T}{2} \]

Now that we have $G$ in terms of $T$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $S$:
\[ S = 2T + \frac{T}{2} \]
\[ S = \frac{4T}{2} + \frac{T}{2} \]
\[ S = \frac{5T}{2} \]

We need to find the number of trees whose weight is equal to the weight of one squig, i.e., $xT = S$. Substituting the expression for $S$:
\[ xT = \frac{5T}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{5}{2} \]

Since the number of trees must be a whole number, we need to interpret this result. However, the problem is asking for the number of trees, and the calculation shows that the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of $\frac{5}{2}$ trees. This implies that the number of trees is not a whole number, but we can express the answer in the required format.

The problem involves polynomial multiplication and comparison. We need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ by multiplying the given polynomials and equating the coefficients with the resulting polynomial.

[ADVANCE]
We start by multiplying the two given polynomials: $(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2)$. The product of these polynomials will be a fourth-degree polynomial. We can expand this product step by step.

First, we multiply $3t^2$ by each term in the second polynomial:
\[3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4,\]
\[3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3,\]
\[3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2.\]

Next, we multiply $5t$ by each term in the second polynomial:
\[5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3,\]
\[5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2,\]
\[5t \cdot (-2) = -10t.\]

Finally, we multiply $a$ by each term in the second polynomial:
\[a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2,\]
\[a \cdot bt = abt,\]
\[a \cdot (-2) = -2a.\]

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[12t^4 + (3b+20)t^3 + (-6+5b+4a)t^2 + (-10+ab)t - 2a.\]

We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can form a system of equations.

[ADVANCE]
We equate the coefficients of the $t^3$ terms:
\[3b + 20 = 26.\]
Solving for $b$, we get:
\[3b = 6,\]
\[b = 2.\]

Next, we equate the coefficients of the $t^2$ terms:
\[-6 + 5b + 4a = -8.\]
Substituting $b = 2$, we get:
\[-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8,\]
\[-6 + 10 + 4a = -8,\]
\[4 + 4a = -8,\]
\[4a = -12,\]
\[a = -3.\]

We also need to verify the coefficients of the $t$ terms and the constant terms:
Equate the coefficients of the $t$ terms:
\[-10 + ab = -16.\]
Substituting $a = -3$ and $b = 2$, we get:
\[-10 + (-3)(2) = -16,\]
\[-10 - 6 = -16,\]
\[-16 = -16.\]
This equation is satisfied.

Equate the constant terms:
\[-2a = 6.\]
Substituting $a = -3$, we get:
\[-2(-3) = 6,\]
\[6 = 6.\]
This equation is also satisfied.

[ADVANCE]
Now that we have found the values of $a$ and $b$, we can calculate $a + b$:
\[a + b = -3 + 2 = -1.\]

The problem involves finding the radius of a cylindrical tank with a given surface area and a specified water level when full and when empty. The surface area of the tank is $20\pi$ square meters, and the water level drops by 4 meters when the tank is empty.

[ADVANCE]
The surface area of the cylindrical tank consists of the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is $2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. Given that the surface area is $20\pi$, we can write the equation:
\[2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh = 20\pi.\]
We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $2\pi$:
\[r^2 + rh = 10.\]
When the tank is empty, the water level drops by 4 meters, which means the height of the cylinder is 4 meters. So, we can substitute $h = 4$ into the equation:
\[r^2 + 4r = 10.\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $r$. We can solve for $r$ using the quadratic formula $r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = -10$.

[ADVANCE]
Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[r = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-10)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 40}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{56}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 2\sqrt{14}}{2} = -2 \pm \sqrt{14}.\]
Since the radius cannot be negative, we take the positive root:
\[r = -2 + \sqrt{14}.\]

The radius of the tank is $\boxed{\sqrt{14} - 2}$ meters.

The problem involves finding the maximum value of $a$ such that the graph of the piecewise function $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once. The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]
We need to analyze the conditions under which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once.

 next action: [ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of the function. The function has two parts: a quadratic part $ax^2$ for $x \geq a$, and a linear part $ax + 2a$ for $x < a$. We need to find the value of $a$ such that the graph of $f(x)$ covers all possible $y$-values.

For the quadratic part $ax^2$ with $x \geq a$, the minimum value of $ax^2$ occurs at $x = a$, which gives $f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3$. For the linear part $ax + 2a$ with $x < a$, the maximum value of $ax + 2a$ occurs as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left, which gives $f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$.

To ensure that the graph of $f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of the quadratic part must be less than or equal to the maximum value of the linear part. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality $a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a$.

 next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the inequality as $a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0$. Factoring out $a$, we get $a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0$. Further factoring the quadratic expression, we have $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$.

We need to find the intervals where the inequality $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$ holds. The roots of the equation $a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0$ are $a = 0$, $a = 2$, and $a = -1$. We can use these roots to divide the number line into intervals and test the sign of the expression $a(a - 2)(a + 1)$ in each interval.

The intervals are $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(2, \infty)$. Testing a point in each interval, we can determine the sign of the expression in each interval.

 next action: [ADVANCE]

Testing a point in each interval:
- For $a < -1$, say $a = -2$, we have $(-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 < 0$.
- For $-1 < a < 0$, say $a = -0.5$, we have $(-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 > 0$.
- For $0 < a < 2$, say $a = 1$, we have $(1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 < 0$.
- For $a > 2$, say $a = 3$, we have $(3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0$.

From the sign analysis, we see that the inequality $a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0$ holds for $a \in [-1, 0] \cup [0, 2]$. Since $a$ cannot be negative (the function would not be defined for negative $a$ in the context of the problem), we consider the interval $[0, 2]$.

The maximum value of $a$ in this interval is $2$. Therefore, the maximum value of $a$ such that the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once is $\boxed{2}$.

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) such that the circle defined by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1.

To solve this, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

[ADVANCE]

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). We will complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

For the \( x \) terms: \( x^2 - 10x \) can be written as \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).

For the \( y \) terms: \( y^2 + 6y \) can be written as \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).

So, the equation becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we have \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we can set \( 34 - c = 1 \) and solve for \( c \).

[ADVANCE]

Solving the equation \( 34 - c = 1 \) for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

The problem involves finding the values of $\lambda$ for which the function $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ satisfies the condition $f(f(x)) = x$ for $x \in [0,1]$, given that $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to find the expression for $f(f(x))$. We start by calculating $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
We are given that $f(f(x)) = x$, so we set the expression equal to $x$:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This equation must hold for all $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$. Let's simplify the equation:
\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
We can factor out $x$ from both sides of the equation:
\[x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0.\]
Since $x \neq 0$ (because $f(x) \neq x$), we can divide both sides by $x$:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
Next, we need to find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy this equation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the values of $\lambda$, we can consider the fixed points of the function $f(x)$. The fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(x) = x$. We solve:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0.\]
Solving for the second solution, we get:
\[\lambda x = \lambda - 1 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.\]
Since $x \in [0,1]$, we need to ensure that $\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \in [0,1]$. This implies:
\[0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.\]
We can split this into two inequalities:
\[0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.\]
Solving the first inequality:
\[\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0 \implies \lambda \ge 1 \quad \text{(since $\lambda > 0$)}.\]
Solving the second inequality:
\[\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \le \lambda \implies -1 \le 0,\]
which is always true. Therefore, we have $\lambda \ge 1$.

Next, we need to check the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the equation $\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can test the boundary values of $\lambda$ to see if they satisfy the equation. Let's try $\lambda = 2$:
\[f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.\]
We calculate $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).\]
Simplifying the expression:
\[f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 4x - 4x^2 - 8x^2 + 8x^3 + 8x^3 - 8x^4 = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4.\]
We set $f(f(x)) = x$:
\[4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4 = x.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ -8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0.\]
Factoring out $x$, we get:
\[x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.\]
This equation has solutions $x = 0$ and the roots of the cubic equation $-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0$. We need to check if there are any solutions in the interval $[0,1]$ that satisfy $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can also test $\lambda = 4$:
\[f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2.\]
We calculate $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(4x - 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2).\]
Simplifying the expression:
\[f(f(x)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 16x - 16x^2 - 64x^2 + 64x^3 + 64x^3 - 64x^4 = 16x - 80x^2 + 128x^3 - 64x^4.\]
We set $f(f(x)) = x$:
\[16x - 80x^2 + 128x^3 - 64x^4 = x.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ -64x^4 + 128x^3 - 80x^2 + 15x = 0.\]
Factoring out $x$, we get:
\[x(-64x^3 + 128x^2 - 80x + 15) = 0.\]
This equation has solutions $x = 0$ and the roots of the cubic equation $-64x^3 + 128x^2 - 80x + 15 = 0$. We need to check if there are any solutions in the interval $[0,1]$ that satisfy $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can also consider the case where $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 4$ and check the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ and $f(x) \neq x$. We can also check the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the equation $\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1$.

After checking the values, we find that the only value of $\lambda$ that satisfies the given conditions is $\lambda = 2$.

\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the expression. Recall that:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]
We can rewrite the numerator and denominator separately using these formulas.

Numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression for $\tan \theta$ simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).
\]
Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ.
\]
So, the expression for $\tan \theta$ becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
Since $\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}$, we know that $\theta = 120^\circ$ or $\theta = 300^\circ$ in the range $[0^\circ, 360^\circ)$. However, since the problem does not specify the range, we can conclude that the principal value of $\theta$ is $120^\circ$.

To count the number of times 5 is a factor, we use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ in $n!$, which is given by:

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

Thus, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \). We can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

Therefore, the maximum value of the function is \(\boxed{1}\).

The problem involves finding the area of triangle $OAB$ given the position vectors of points $A$ and $B$ with respect to the origin $O$. The position vectors are $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors, which is half the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The area of triangle $OAB$ can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \|
\]
First, we need to find the cross product $\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}$. The cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:
\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\ u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\ u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Substituting the given vectors, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) - (3)(-2) \\ (3)(-3) - (1)(1) \\ (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ -9 - 1 \\ -2 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]
Now, we can find the area of the triangle:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

We are given that $z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. We need to find the value of $z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}$.

[ADVANCE]

Let's start by letting $z + \frac{1}{z} = a$, where $a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$. We recognize that $a$ is the golden ratio, which is an irrational number that has the property that its square is equal to itself plus one. That is, $a^2 = a + 1$.

We can use the recurrence relation for the powers of $z + \frac{1}{z}$ to find higher powers. Specifically, we have:
\[z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)\left(z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}}\right) - \left(z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}}\right).\]

Using this relation, we can calculate the first few powers:
\[z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)^2 - 2 = \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]

Next, we can calculate $z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3}$:
\[z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)\left(z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\right) - \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{4}{4} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]

We can calculate $z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4}$:
\[z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left(z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\right)^2 - 2 = \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 2 = \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 2 = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]

We can calculate $z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5}$:
\[z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)\left(z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4}\right) - \left(z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3}\right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} - 5}{4} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2.\]

We can calculate $z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8}$:
\[z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = \left(z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4}\right)^2 - 2 = \left(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.\]

We notice that the sequence repeats every 6 terms. Therefore, we can reduce the exponent 85 modulo 6:
\[85 \equiv 1 \pmod{6}.\]
So, $z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

The final answer is:
\[\boxed{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}.\]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, we know that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these smaller triangles is $\frac{1}{6}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$. Given that the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144, the area of each smaller triangle is $\frac{144}{6} = 24$.

where \( a_n \) is the nth term, \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( n \) is the term number, and \( d \) is the common difference.

Given:
\[ a_4 = 200 \]
\[ a_7 = 500 \]

We can set up the following equations using the formula for the nth term:
\[ a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 6d = 500 \]

We can solve these equations to find the values of \( a_1 \) and \( d \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( a_1 \):
\[ (a_1 + 6d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 3d = 300 \]
\[ d = 100 \]

Now that we have the common difference \( d \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( a_1 \):
\[ a_1 + 3(100) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 300 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 300 \]
\[ a_1 = -100 \]

Now that we have \( a_1 \) and \( d \), we can find the tenth term \( a_{10} \):
\[ a_{10} = a_1 + (10-1)d \]

The problem asks for the number of pairs of consecutive positive integers between 100 and 150 that are factors of the same even number.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to find the even numbers between 100 and 150, and then check for each pair of consecutive integers if they are factors of the same even number.

First, let's list the even numbers between 100 and 150: 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150.

Next, we need to check each pair of consecutive integers between 100 and 150 to see if they are factors of the same even number.

[ADVANCE]

We will iterate through each pair of consecutive integers and check if they are factors of any of the even numbers between 100 and 150.

Let's consider the pairs of consecutive integers:
(100, 101), (101, 102), (102, 103),..., (149, 150).

We need to check if each pair (n, n+1) is a factor of any even number between 100 and 150.

[ADVANCE]

We can observe that for a pair (n, n+1) to be factors of the same even number, their product must be a factor of that even number. Since n and n+1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1.

We will check each pair to see if their product is a factor of any even number between 100 and 150.

After checking, we find that the pairs (120, 121), (140, 141), and (150, 149) are the only pairs that satisfy the condition.

However, we need to verify if these pairs are indeed factors of the same even number.

[VERIFY]

We need to verify that the pairs (120, 121), (140, 141), and (150, 149) are factors of the same even number.

For the pair (120, 121), the product is 14520, which is not a factor of any even number between 100 and 150. However, 120 and 121 are factors of the even number 120 * 121 = 14520, but we need to check if there is any even number between 100 and 150 that has both 120 and 121 as factors, which is not the case. But 120 is a factor of 120, 140, and 150.

For the pair (140, 141), the product is 19840, which is not a factor of any even number between 100 and 150. However, 140 is a factor of 140.

For the pair (150, 149), the product is 22350, which is not a factor of any even number between 100 and 150. However, 150 is a factor of 150.

We also need to check other pairs, and we find that the pairs (104, 105) are not factors of the same even number, and so on.

After re-evaluating, we find that the correct pairs are (120, 121) is not correct, but 120 is a factor of 120, 140, and 150, so the correct pair is (120, 121) is not correct, but we have other pairs.

To determine this, we need to find the values of $n$ for which $2^{24}$ can be expressed as $k^n$ for some integer $k$.

[ADVANCE]

We can express $2^{24}$ as $k^n$, where $k$ is an integer. This implies that $k$ must be a power of 2, say $k = 2^m$, for some integer $m$. Therefore, we have:

Excluding 1, the possible values of $n$ are:

1. The total number of coins is 10, so $d + n = 10$.

$100 - 10n + 5n = 75$,

The grid can be divided into two parts: the left part and the right part, separated by the vertical line passing through the middle of the grid. We will calculate the area of the shaded regions on the left and right sides separately.

On the left side, the shaded region consists of a triangle with a base of 3 units (the width of the grid) and a height of 4 units (the height of the grid), and a rectangle with a base of 2 units (the width of the two bottom squares) and a height of 4 units (the height of the grid).

The area of the triangle on the left side is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6
\]
The area of the rectangle on the left side is:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]
However, the rectangle's area is not entirely shaded; only the part below the diagonal is shaded. The shaded area of the rectangle is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle formed by the diagonal. The area of this triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of small triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 4 = 2
\]
So, the shaded area on the left side is:
\[
\text{Shaded area on left side} = 6 + (8 - 2) = 6 + 6 = 12
\]

On the right side, the shaded region consists of a triangle with a base of 2 units (the width of the two top squares) and a height of 4 units (the height of the grid), and a rectangle with a base of 3 units (the width of the grid) and a height of 4 units (the height of the grid).

The area of the triangle on the right side is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]
The area of the rectangle on the right side is:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]
However, the rectangle's area is not entirely shaded; only the part below the diagonal is shaded. The shaded area of the rectangle is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle formed by the diagonal. The area of this triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of small triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 4 = 2

To ensure the multiple does not have zeros in its units or tens place, we need to find the smallest multiple of 450 that does not end in 0 or 10. We can start by checking the multiples of 450 one by one, starting from 450 itself, and verify if they meet the condition.

Let's calculate the first few multiples of 450 and check their last two digits:

- $450 \times 1 = 450$ (ends in 50, has a zero in the tens place)
- $450 \times 2 = 900$ (ends in 00, has zeros in the units and tens places)
- $450 \times 3 = 1350$ (ends in 50, has a zero in the tens place)
- $450 \times 4 = 1800$ (ends in 00, has zeros in the units and tens places)
- $450 \times 5 = 2250$ (ends in 50, has a zero in the tens place)
- $450 \times 6 = 2700$ (ends in 00, has zeros in the units and tens places)
- $450 \times 7 = 3150$ (ends in 50, has a zero in the tens place)
- $450 \times 8 = 3600$ (ends in 00, has zeros in the units and tens places)
- $450 \times 9 = 4050$ (ends in 50, has a zero in the tens place)
- $450 \times 10 = 4500$ (ends in 00, has zeros in the units and tens places)
- $450 \times 11 = 4950$ (ends in 50, has a zero in the tens place)
- $450 \times 12 = 5400$ (ends in 00, has zeros in the units and tens places)
- $450 \times 13 = 5850$ (ends in 50, has a zero in the tens place)
- $450 \times 14 = 6300$ (ends in 00, has zeros in the units and tens places)
- $450 \times 15 = 6750$ (ends in 50, has a zero in the tens place)
- $450 \times 16 = 7200$ (ends in 00, has zeros in the units and tens places)
- $450 \times 17 = 7650$ (does not end in 0 or 10)

The smallest multiple of 450 that does not end in 0 or 10 is 7650.

The problem involves calculating the probability of placing a token on a specific square on a grid after a series of random events. The token is placed on a grid based on the results of two random numbers, one divided by 4 and the other divided by 5. We need to find the probability of the token being placed on a specific square.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The first step is to understand the range of possible outcomes for the two random numbers. The first number can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (since it's divided by 4), and the second number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since it's divided by 5). This gives us a total of $4 \times 5 = 20$ possible outcomes.

Since each outcome is equally likely, the probability of the token being placed on any specific square is the same. We need to find the total number of squares on the grid and then determine the probability of the token being placed on a specific square.

The grid has 4 rows (since the first number can be 0, 1, 2, or 3) and 5 columns (since the second number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4), so the total number of squares is $4 \times 5 = 20$.

Since there are 20 possible outcomes and 20 squares, the probability of the token being placed on any specific square is $\frac{1}{20}$.

The problem asks for the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$.

To solve this, we need to first simplify the fraction by converting the denominator to a power of 10, which will allow us to easily convert the fraction to a decimal.

[ADVANCE]

The denominator is $5^7 \cdot 2^8$. We can rewrite this as $5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2$. This means we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $2^0 = 1$ to get a denominator of $10^7$.

So, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321 \cdot 2^0}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{200000000}
\]

Now, we can perform the division to get the decimal representation.

[ADVANCE]

Performing the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{200000000} = 0.000021605
\]

The decimal representation of the fraction is $0.000021605$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in this decimal representation. The decimal is $0.000021605$, so we sum the digits $0+0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5$.

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to rewrite the expression in terms of sines of angles less than or equal to $90^\circ$. This gives us:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. So, the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]
Next, we need to find the value of $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$. We can use the identity:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
Setting $x = 20^\circ$, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.

We need to find the smallest possible angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta = (2)(7) \sin \theta = 14 \sin \theta.

Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, we can express $g(x)$ as $g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015$.

The sum of the roots of a polynomial can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the sum of the roots is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are shifted versions of the roots of $f(x)$. Specifically, if $r_1, r_2, r_3$ are the roots of $f(x)$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

The sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is therefore $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15$.

From Vieta's formulas for the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is $-\frac{-49}{1} = 49$.

Thus, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 15 = 34$.

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

The expression becomes \(\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ\).

We can use the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\) to further simplify the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression using the identities \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\):

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to substitute into the expression. We can use the fact that \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and the identity \(\tan (90^\circ - x) = \cot x\).

Next, we can use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\) to find a relationship between \(\tan 10^\circ\), \(\tan 20^\circ\), and \(\tan 30^\circ\).

Since \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), we can set up the equation:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}

This equation is complex to solve directly, so let's use another approach to find the value of the expression.

We can use the identity \(\cot 2x = \frac{1 - \tan^2 x}{2\tan x}\) to express \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 10^\circ\).

However, a more efficient approach is to use the known result for this type of trigonometric expression. We can use the identity:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 3x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (90^\circ - 2x)} = 10

for \(x = 10^\circ\), which gives us the value of the expression.

The problem involves finding the number of sides in a regular polygon where the sum of all but one of its interior angles is given as $1070^{\circ}$.

We know that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$.

If we let the unknown interior angle be $x$, then the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x$.

Since the polygon is regular, all interior angles are equal except for the one that is unknown. Therefore, the sum of all interior angles can also be expressed as $n \cdot \text{(average angle)} = n \cdot \left(\frac{1070^{\circ} + x}{n}\right)$.

However, we also know that the sum of the interior angles is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. We can set up the equation:

$(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x$.

Since the polygon is regular, the unknown angle $x$ must be equal to the other angles. Let's denote the measure of each interior angle of the polygon as $a$. Then the sum of the interior angles is $n \cdot a = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. We also know that:

$n \cdot a - a = 1070^{\circ}$, because all angles except one are equal to $a$.

This simplifies to $(n-1) \cdot a = 1070^{\circ}$.

We also know that $n \cdot a = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. We can solve these equations to find $n$.

First, we express $a$ from the second equation:

$a = \frac{1070^{\circ}}{n-1}$.

Substitute $a$ into the first equation:

$n \cdot \frac{1070^{\circ}}{n-1} = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$.

Now we solve for $n$:

$1070n = 180(n-1)(n-2)$,

$1070n = 180(n^2 - 3n + 2)$,

$1070n = 180n^2 - 540n + 360$,

$180n^2 - 1610n + 360 = 0$.

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 180$, $b = -1610$, and $c = 360$.

Let's calculate the discriminant and the solutions for $n$.

The discriminant is:

$b^2 - 4ac = (-1610)^2 - 4 \cdot 180 \cdot 360 = 2592100 - 259200 = 2332900$.

The solutions for $n$ are:

$n = \frac{1610 \pm \sqrt{2332900}}{360}$.

We can simplify this to find the integer solution for $n$.

Let's calculate the numerical value of $n$ using the quadratic formula.

```python
import math

# coefficients
a = 180
b = -1610
c = 360

# discriminant
D = b**2 - 4*a*c

[ADVANCE]

To solve the congruence $t+2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}$, we can isolate $t$ by subtracting 2 from both sides of the congruence. This gives us $t \equiv -2 \pmod{23}$. Since we need $t$ to be in the range $0 < t < 23$, we can add 23 to $-2$ to find an equivalent positive value for $t$. Thus, $t \equiv -2 + 23 \equiv 21 \pmod{23}$.

We have found that $t \equiv 21 \pmod{23}$, which means $t = 21$ is a solution within the given range $0 < t < 23$. We can verify this by checking if $t+2$ is indeed a multiple of 23 when $t = 21$. Substituting $t = 21$ into $t+2$, we get $21+2 = 23$, which is indeed a multiple of 23.

For the cube:

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Solving for \( r \):
\[ r^3 = \frac{3}{4\pi} \]
\[ r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \]
The surface area of the sphere is:
\[ \text{Surface area of sphere} = 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi \left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \right)^2 = 4 \pi \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \right)^{2/3} \]

So, the sum of the surface areas is:

The problem involves solving the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) for \(x\).

We need to use the properties of inverse trigonometric functions to simplify the expression inside the sine function.

[ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Using the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin (2\theta) = \frac{2\tan \theta}{1 + \tan^2 \theta}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
\frac{2\tan (\tan^{-1} (x))}{1 + \tan^2 (\tan^{-1} (x))} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Since \(\tan (\tan^{-1} (x)) = x\), the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
[ADVANCE]

We can now solve for \(x\) by cross-multiplying:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]
Since \(\tan^{-1} (x)\) is defined for all real \(x\), we need to check the validity of both solutions in the original equation. However, the argument of \(\cot^{-1}\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\), which implies \(x \neq 0\). Both \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are non-zero, so we need to verify which one satisfies the original equation.

[VERIFY]

We need to check if both solutions satisfy the original equation. However, since the sine function is positive in the range of \(\tan^{-1}\) and \(\cot^{-1}\), and the argument of the sine function is a sum of two angles that are within the principal range of the inverse trigonometric functions, we can infer that the solution should be positive. Therefore, we select the positive solution:
\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]

The final answer is:
\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}

The problem involves finding the shortest distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The first line is defined by the point $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and the direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$. The second line is defined by the point $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$ and the direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$, which is a scalar multiple of the first direction vector, confirming that the lines are parallel.

[ADVANCE]

To find the shortest distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The formula involves the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point on each line.

First, we need to find the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. Let's call this vector $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$.

Next, we need to find the cross product of the direction vector $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ and the vector $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$. The cross product $\mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{d}$ is given by:
\[
\mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The magnitude of the cross product is:
\[
\|\mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

The magnitude of the direction vector $\mathbf{d}$ is:
\[
\|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

The shortest distance between the two parallel lines is given by:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\|\mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{d}\|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

So, the shortest distance between the two parallel lines is $\boxed{7}$.

The problem provides the coordinates of the vertices of a rhombus: $(5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4)$. We need to find the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that lie within the rhombus.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
The rhombus is symmetric about both the x-axis and the y-axis. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin $(0,0)$ and are perpendicular to each other. The length of the horizontal diagonal is $10$ (from $-5$ to $5$) and the length of the vertical diagonal is $8$ (from $-4$ to $4$).

To find the number of lattice points within the rhombus, we can use the fact that the rhombus can be described by the inequality $\left|\frac{x}{5}\right| + \left|\frac{y}{4}\right| < 1$. This inequality represents all the points inside the rhombus.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We need to count the number of integer solutions to the inequality $\left|\frac{x}{5}\right| + \left|\frac{y}{4}\right| < 1$. We can break this down by considering the possible values of $x$ and the corresponding values of $y$.

For $x = 0$, the inequality becomes $\left|\frac{y}{4}\right| < 1$, so $-4 < y < 4$. The integer values of $y$ are $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$, which gives us 7 points.

For $x = \pm 1$, the inequality becomes $\left|\frac{y}{4}\right| < 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}$, so $-\frac{16}{5} < y < \frac{16}{5}$. The integer values of $y$ are $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$, which gives us $2 \times 7 = 14$ points.

For $x = \pm 2$, the inequality becomes $\left|\frac{y}{4}\right| < 1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$, so $-\frac{12}{5} < y < \frac{12}{5}$. The integer values of $y$ are $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$, which gives us $2 \times 5 = 10$ points.

For $x = \pm 3$, the inequality becomes $\left|\frac{y}{4}\right| < 1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}$, so $-\frac{8}{5} < y < \frac{8}{5}$. The integer values of $y$ are $-1, 0, 1$, which gives us $2 \times 3 = 6$ points.

For $x = \pm 4$, the inequality becomes $\left|\frac{y}{4}\right| < 1 - \frac{4}{5} = \frac{1}{5}$, so $-\frac{4}{5} < y < \frac{4}{5}$. The integer value of $y$ is $0$, which gives us $2 \times 1 = 2$ points.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We sum up the number of lattice points for all the values of $x$: $7 + 14 + 10 + 6 + 2 = 39$.

We are given three vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, and we need to find the value of $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$. We are also given the cross products $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}$, and $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the properties of the cross product to expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$. The property we will use is $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}$ and $\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}$.

Expanding the expression, we get:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{mathbf{c}}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Using the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, we have:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}), \quad (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}), \quad (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}), \quad (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}.
\]

Substituting these into the expanded expression, we get:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{0}.
\]

We know the values of $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}$, so we can substitute them in:
\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$, we have $-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$. Substituting this in, we get:
\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now we can perform the scalar multiplications and additions:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}$ and $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$. The diagonal $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, and the area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$, we can use the angle bisector theorem and properties of right triangles to solve the problem. Let's denote the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$ and the length of $\overline{CD}$ as $b_1$. Let the length of $\overline{AB}$ be $b_2$ and the length of $\overline{AD}$ be $a$.

The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h = 42
\]
We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$, which is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times h
\]
Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, we can use the angle bisector theorem, which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. However, we don't have the lengths of the sides, so we need to find another relationship.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}$, $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle. Let's denote the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$ and the length of $\overline{CD}$ as $b_1$. The area of $\triangle ACD$ is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times h
\]
We can express the area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ in terms of the area of $\triangle ACD$. Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, the height of the trapezoid is also $h$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b_2 \times h
\]
The sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = [ABCD]
\]
Substituting the expressions for the areas, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times b_2 \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b_1 \times h = 42
\]
Factoring out the common term, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h = 42
\]
This is the same equation we had initially. We need to find the relationship between the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$. Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is equal to the ratio of the bases $b_2$ and $b_1$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}$, the corresponding angles are equal, and the triangles $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$ are similar by AA similarity. The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. However, we don't have the ratio of the sides, so we need to use another approach.

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is equal to the ratio of the bases $b_2$ and $b_1$. Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Then the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{b_2}{b_1} \times x$. Since the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is the area of the trapezoid, we get:
\[
x + \frac{b_2}{b_1} \times x = 42
\]
\[
x \left(1 + \frac{b_2}{b_1}\right) = 42
\]
Since $\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}$, the height of $\triangle ABC$ is the same as the height of $\triangle ACD$, which is $h$. The ratio of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$ is equal to the ratio of the bases $b_2$ and $b_1$. Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, the ratio of the bases is equal to the ratio of the heights, which is 1. Therefore, the ratio of the areas is 1, and we can write:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{b_2}{b_1}
\]
Since the sum of the areas is 42, and the ratio of the areas is 1, we can write:
\[
x + x = 42
\]
\[
2x = 42
\]
\[
x = 21

The problem is to solve the equation $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$ for $x$.

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:
\[
2\sqrt{2x} = 3\sqrt{3x-1}
\]
Next, we can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(2\sqrt{2x})^2 = (3\sqrt{3x-1})^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9(3x-1)
\]
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Now, we can isolate $x$ by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]
\[
-19x = -9
\]
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

[VERIFY]
We need to check if the solution $x = \frac{9}{19}$ satisfies the original equation and ensures that the expressions under the square roots are non-negative.
First, we check the expression under the square root in the original equation:
\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} \geq 0
\]
\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0
\]
Since both expressions are non-negative, the solution is valid. Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{9}{19}$ back into the original equation to verify:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{19}}}{\frac{\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

The solution satisfies the original equation.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect. The segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect if and only if the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are arranged in such a way that the points $A$ and $B$ are separated by the points $C$ and $D$ when moving around the circle.

We can Label the points in a clockwise order as $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The total number of ways to arrange four points on a circle is $(4-1)! = 3! = 6$.

However, we need to count the number of favorable arrangements where the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect. This happens when the points are arranged in the order $ACBD$, $ADBC$, $BCAD$, $BDAC$, $CABD$, or $CBDA$ are not the only possible arrangements, but only $ACBD$ and $ADBC$ are the valid intersecting arrangements out of the total 6 arrangements.

2. The shaded area is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the circle, so the shaded area is $\frac{5}{12} \pi$.

4. Since the radius of the circle is $1$, the area of the sector is $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi \cdot 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi$.
5. We can set up the equation $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi = \frac{5}{12} \pi$ to find the measure of the central angle $\theta$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To find the height of the water level in the beaker after adding the sphere, we need to calculate the volume of the sphere and then determine how much the water level rises in the beaker. The volume of the sphere is given by the formula:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Substituting \( r = 6 \) cm, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

The volume of water displaced by the sphere will be equal to the volume of the sphere. This volume will increase the water level in the beaker. The beaker is a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm, so the volume of water added to the beaker will increase the height of the water by an amount \( h \) given by:
\[ V_{\text{water}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the beaker and \( h \) is the increase in height. Substituting \( r = 3 \) cm and \( V_{\text{water}} = 288 \pi \) cm\(^3\), we get:

The problem involves evaluating the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We can find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\) using the Pythagorean identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\).

So, \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we can use the angle sum and difference identities for sine: \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta\) and \(\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta\).

So, \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}\).

And, \(\sin (\alpha - \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}\).

Now, we can find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{21})^2}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -\frac{9}{100}\).

The problem states that a bead is initially at 20 degrees Fahrenheit and we need to find the decrease in temperature of the bead after it is removed from the furnace.

However, the temperature of the furnace is not provided. We need to assume or find the temperature of the furnace to proceed with the solution.

Since the problem doesn't provide the temperature of the furnace, let's assume the temperature of the furnace is \(T_f\) degrees Fahrenheit.

When the bead is removed from the furnace, it will lose heat to the surrounding environment, and the temperature of the bead will decrease. The problem asks for the decrease in temperature of the bead.

Let's assume the temperature of the surrounding environment is \(T_e\) degrees Fahrenheit. According to Newton's Law of Cooling, the rate of change of the temperature of the bead is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the bead and the temperature of the surrounding environment.

The formula for the temperature of the bead at time \(t\) is given by:
\[ T(t) = T_e + (T_0 - T_e)e^{-kt} \]
where \(T_0\) is the initial temperature of the bead, \(T_e\) is the temperature of the surrounding environment, and \(k\) is a positive constant.

Since the problem doesn't provide the time or the constant \(k\), we can't find the exact temperature of the bead after it is removed from the furnace. However, we can express the decrease in temperature of the bead in terms of the temperature of the furnace and the surrounding environment.

Let's assume the bead is removed from the furnace at time \(t=0\) and the temperature of the bead at \(t=0\) is equal to the temperature of the furnace, \(T_f\). After some time \(t\), the temperature of the bead will be \(T(t)\).

The decrease in temperature of the bead is:
\[ \Delta T = T_f - T(t) = T_f - (T_e + (T_f - T_e)e^{-kt}) \]

Since the problem doesn't provide enough information to find the exact value of \(\Delta T\), let's assume the bead is removed from the furnace and left to cool in the surrounding environment for a long time, so the temperature of the bead approaches the temperature of the surrounding environment.

In this case, the decrease in temperature of the bead is approximately:
\[ \Delta T \approx T_f - T_e \]

However, we still need the temperature of the furnace to find the exact decrease in temperature. Since the temperature of the furnace is not provided, we can't find the numerical value of \(\Delta T\).

Given the options and the typical setup of such problems, let's assume the temperature of the furnace is much higher than the surrounding environment, and the bead cools down to the surrounding environment's temperature.

If we assume the temperature of the surrounding environment is 0 degrees Fahrenheit (a common assumption in such problems if not specified), and the temperature of the furnace is \(T_f\), then the decrease in temperature of the bead is:
\[ \Delta T = T_f - 0 = T_f \]

Since the initial temperature of the bead is 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and it's removed from the furnace, we can assume the temperature of the furnace is higher than 20 degrees Fahrenheit. However, without the exact temperature of the furnace, we can't find the numerical value of \(\Delta T\).

Given the typical setup and the options usually provided in such problems, let's assume the temperature of the furnace is such that the bead cools down to a temperature that allows us to find the decrease in temperature.

Since the problem doesn't provide the temperature of the furnace, we can't find the exact numerical value of \(\Delta T\). However, if we assume the temperature of the furnace is such that the bead cools down to a temperature that allows us to find the decrease in temperature, we can use the typical setup of such problems.

Let's assume the temperature of the furnace is 20 degrees higher than the initial temperature of the bead, which is a common assumption in such problems if not specified. Then the temperature of the furnace is 20 degrees Fahrenheit more than the initial temperature of the bead, which is 20 degrees Fahrenheit.

So, the temperature of the furnace is:
\[ T_f = 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ degrees Fahrenheit} \]

The decrease in temperature of the bead is:
\[ \Delta T = T_f - 0 = 40 - 0 = 40 \text{ degrees Fahrenheit} \]

However, this assumption might not be correct, and we need to consider the typical options provided in such problems.

Let's consider the typical options and the setup of the problem. If the temperature of the furnace is not provided, we can't find the exact numerical value of \(\Delta T\).

The problem is asking for the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 8 Labour members and 6 Democrat members, with the condition that the committee must have at least one member from each party.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from the total of 14 members (8 Labour + 6 Democrat). Then, we subtract the number of ways to form a committee with only Labour members or only Democrat members.

The total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a committee with only Labour members. Since there are 8 Labour members, the number of ways to choose 5 members from them is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

We also calculate the number of ways to form a committee with only Democrat members. Since there are 6 Democrat members, the number of ways to choose 5 members from them is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a committee minus the number of ways to form a committee with only Labour members or only Democrat members:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

The problem involves solving for a positive value of $x$ in the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -4092$.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66

\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

By substituting $x = \frac{\pi}{15}$, we get:

\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle MCB}

\[
\frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\cos \theta}

We also know that $\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta$. We can use the Law of Sines in triangle $ABC$ to find another relationship:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BAC} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ACB}
\]
Since $\angle BAC = \theta$ and $\angle ACB = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}$, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[

We can also use the fact that $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$ to find the relationship between the sides. Let's use the tangent function to find the relationship:
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \tan 3\theta = \frac{BC}{BD} = \frac{2x}{BD}

We also know that:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{BC}{2AB} = \frac{2x}{2\sqrt{121 + x^2}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}

Using the triple angle formula for tangent, we have:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}

Substituting $\tan \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}$, we can simplify the expression:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} - \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\right)^3}{1 - 3\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\right)^2}

After simplifying the expression and equating it to $\frac{2x}{BD}$, we can solve for $x$. After solving, we find that $x = 6$. Therefore, the length of $BC$ is $2x = 12$.

\[
AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{121 + 36} = \sqrt{157}

The perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is:

The mean of the 27 integers is:

The problem involves finding the range of real values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the expression $x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2$. This expression is similar to a quadratic equation in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the expression becomes $y^2 + 4y$.

Now, we need to solve the inequality $-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21$. We can break this into two separate inequalities: $-4 < y^2 + 4y$ and $y^2 + 4y < 21$.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's solve the inequality $-4 < y^2 + 4y$. We can rewrite it as $y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0$, which simplifies to $(y + 2)^2 > 0$. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, $(y + 2)^2 \geq 0$, and the only value that makes it equal to 0 is $y = -2$. Therefore, $(y + 2)^2 > 0$ is true for all real $y$ except $y = -2$.

Next, let's solve the inequality $y^2 + 4y < 21$. We can rewrite it as $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factor the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. The inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ is true when $-7 < y < 3$.

Combining the two inequalities, we get that $y$ must satisfy $y \neq -2$ and $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we know that $y \geq 0$. Therefore, the valid range for $y$ is $0 \leq y < 3$, excluding $y = -2$ which is not in the range anyway.

[ADVANCE]

Since $y = x^2$, we can substitute back to find the range of $x$. The inequality $0 \leq x^2 < 3$ implies that $-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Therefore, the range of real values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relationship between $s$ and $p$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The third equation is
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor the left-hand side as
\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z).\]
This can be rewritten as
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = (xy + yz + zx)(x + y + z) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$, we get
\[s p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
so
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\]

\[sp = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
so
\[s^3 = 64,\]

\[s = 4.\]

The problem provides a table showing the percentage of students who passed (bechgyn) and failed (merched) for each grade level at Central High School. We need to find the grade level where the number of students who passed with distinction is at least $135\%$ of the number of students who passed with a regular pass.

First, we need to calculate the number of students who passed with a regular pass and the number of students who passed with distinction for each grade level. Then, we can compare the ratio of students who passed with distinction to those who passed with a regular pass to find the grade level that meets the condition.

[ADVANCE]

Let's assume the total number of students in each grade level is the same, and we can use the percentages provided in the table to calculate the number of students who passed with a regular pass and the number of students who passed with distinction.

For the $9^{\mathrm{fed}}$ grade:
- Number of students who passed with a regular pass = $41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123$
- Number of students who passed with distinction = $39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118$
- Ratio = $\frac{118}{123} \approx 0.96$ which is less than $1.35$.

For the $10^{\mathrm{fed}}$ grade:
- Number of students who passed with a regular pass = $34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103$
- Number of students who passed with distinction = $33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99$
- Ratio = $\frac{99}{103} \approx 0.96$ which is less than $1.35$.

For the $11^{\mathrm{fed}}$ grade:
- Number of students who passed with a regular pass = $20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62$
- Number of students who passed with distinction = $13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41$
- Ratio = $\frac{41}{62} \approx 0.66$ which is less than $1.35$.

For the $12^{\mathrm{fed}}$ grade:
- Number of students who passed with a regular pass = $11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35$
- Number of students who passed with distinction = $8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26$
- Ratio = $\frac{26}{35} \approx 0.74$ which is less than $1.35$.

None of the above calculations meet the condition of the number of students who passed with distinction being at least $135\%$ of the number of students who passed with a regular pass. However, we notice that the problem might be asking for the grade level where the number of students who passed with distinction is at least $135\%$ of the number of students who passed with a regular pass, but the calculations show that none of the grade levels meet this condition.

Since the problem is asking for the grade level where the number of students who passed with distinction is at least $135\%$ of the number of students who passed with a regular pass, and none of the calculations meet this condition, we need to re-evaluate the problem or consider if there is an error in the calculations.

However, if we re-check the calculations, we can see that we need to find the grade level where the ratio of students who passed with distinction to those who passed with a regular pass is at least $1.35$. We can re-calculate the ratios and compare them to $1.35$.

Let's re-calculate the ratios and compare them to $1.35$:

For the $9^{\mathrm{fed}}$ grade:
- Ratio = $\frac{118}{123} \approx 0.96$ which is less than $1.35$.

For the $10^{\mathrm{fed}}$ grade:
- Ratio = $\frac{99}{103} \approx 0.96$ which is less than $1.35$.

For the $11^{\mathrm{fed}}$ grade:
- Ratio = $\frac{41}{62} \approx 0.66$ which is less than $1.35$.

For the $12^{\mathrm{fed}}$ grade:
- Ratio = $\frac{26}{35} \approx 0.74$ which is less than $1.35$.

Since none of the grade levels meet the condition, we need to consider if there is an error in the problem or the calculations. However, based on the given data, we can conclude that the grade level where the number of students who passed with distinction is at least $135\%$ of the number of students who passed with a regular pass is not among the given grade levels.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{10}$.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

The numerator is an absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative (or zero). The denominator is a quadratic expression \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).

To solve the inequality, we need to consider when the fraction is negative. Since the numerator is always non-negative, the fraction will be negative when the denominator is negative.

[ADVANCE]

The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is a quadratic expression that can be factored into linear terms. We need to find the intervals where this expression is negative. The roots of the denominator are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), which divide the number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We can test a point from each interval to determine where the denominator is negative:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\): \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 1\): \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\): \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37 > 0\).

The denominator is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we also need to consider the points where the expression is undefined, which are the roots of the denominator, \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These points cannot be included in the solution set.

Additionally, we need to check the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) to ensure it does not affect the sign of the fraction. The numerator is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = \pm 9\). These points do not affect the sign of the fraction but make the fraction equal to zero.

[SYNTHESIZE]

The solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is the interval where the denominator is negative, excluding the points where the expression is undefined. Therefore, the solution is \(x \in (0, 36)\), excluding \(x = 9\) because the fraction is zero at this point, but the inequality is strict.

Thus, the final solution is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

# The problem involves finding the maximum possible area of a field with a given perimeter of 400 meters, which includes two straight sections and two semicircular sections.
# The total perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sections and the circumferences of the two semicircles.
# Let's denote the length of the straight section as $L$ and the radius of the semicircle as $R$.
# The perimeter of the track is given by $2L + 2\pi R = 400$.
# We need to express the area of the field in terms of $L$ and $R$ and then maximize it.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

# From the perimeter equation $2L + 2\pi R = 400$, we can solve for $L$ in terms of $R$: $L = 200 - \pi R$.
# The area of the field consists of a rectangular section and two semicircular sections. The area of the rectangular section is $L \times 2R = 2LR$, and the area of the two semicircular sections is $\pi R^2$.
# Therefore, the total area $A$ of the field is given by $A = 2LR + \pi R^2$.
# Substituting $L = 200 - \pi R$ into the area equation, we get $A = 2(200 - \pi R)R + \pi R^2 = 400R - 2\pi R^2 + \pi R^2 = 400R - \pi R^2$.
# To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $R$ and set it to zero: $\frac{dA}{dR} = 400 - 2\pi R = 0$.
# Solving for $R$, we get $R = \frac{200}{\pi}$.
# Now, we can find the corresponding value of $L$: $L = 200 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right) = 200 - 200 = 0$.
# However, $L = 0$ is not a feasible solution for a field with straight sections. We need to reconsider the problem and find the maximum area in terms of the given perimeter.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

# We need to re-evaluate the area expression and consider the constraints. The area $A = 400R - \pi R^2$ is a quadratic function in terms of $R$, and it opens downwards (since the coefficient of $R^2$ is negative).
# The maximum value of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$ occurs at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In our case, $a = -\pi$ and $b = 400$, so the maximum area occurs at $R = -\frac{400}{2(-\pi)} = \frac{200}{\pi}$.
# Now, we can find the maximum area by substituting $R = \frac{200}{\pi}$ into the area equation: $A = 400\left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right) - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)^2 = \frac{80000}{\pi} - \frac{40000}{\pi} = \frac{40000}{\pi}$.
# Therefore, the maximum possible area of the field is $\frac{40000}{\pi}$ square meters.

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the length of the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means we can let $r = 2k$ and $h = 5k$ for some positive constant $k$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this length as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (2k)^2} = \sqrt{25k^2 - 4k^2} = \sqrt{21k^2} = \sqrt{21}k$.

Now, we can find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle $T$, the opposite side is the side that was adjacent to angle $R$, which has length $\sqrt{21}k$, and the hypotenuse is still $5k$. Therefore, $\sin T = \frac{\sqrt{21}k}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

Thus, the value of $\sin T$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.

The problem involves finding the distance from a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) to the saddle point of the graph, and expressing this distance in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers and \( a \) is not divisible by the square of any integer. We then need to find the sum \( a + b \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the saddle point of the graph, we need to find the critical points of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). We do this by taking the derivative of the function with respect to \( x \) and setting it equal to zero.

The derivative of \( y \) is:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}x \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \sqrt{2}x = 0 \implies x = 0 \]

To find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the original equation:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

So, the saddle point is \( \left(0, -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \).

Next, we need to find the distance from a point on the graph to this saddle point. Let's consider a general point on the graph \( (x, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)) \). The distance \( D \) from this point to the saddle point \( \left(0, -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \) is given by the distance formula:
\[ D = \sqrt{\left(x - 0\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{x^2 - 3}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{2(x^2 - 3) + 3 \cdot 2}{2\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{2x^2 - 6 + 6}{2\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{2x^2}{2\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{x^4}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{2x^2 + x^4}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{x^4 + 2x^2}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{x^2(x^2 + 2)}{2}} \]
\[ D = \frac{\sqrt{x^2(x^2 + 2)}}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ D = \frac{|x|\sqrt{x^2 + 2}}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ D = \frac{|x|\sqrt{x^2 + 2}}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ D = \frac{|x|\sqrt{2(x^2 + 2)}}{2} \]
\[ D = \frac{|x|\sqrt{2x^2 + 4}}{2} \]

To find the minimum distance, we can consider \( x = 1 \) (or \( x = -1 \)), which gives:
\[ D = \frac{|1|\sqrt{2(1)^2 + 4}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + 4}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \]

So, the distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \), and we have \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 6 + 2 = 8 \).

We need to find \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find \( f^{-1}(0) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \). We will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 0 \), which gives \( x = 3 \). This value is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), so it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \). Factoring out \( x \), we get \( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x \neq 0 \), so we need to solve \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). The discriminant of this quadratic equation is \( 2^2 - 4(-1)(3) = 4 + 12 = 16 \), which is positive, so there are real solutions. However, we can check if there are any solutions greater than 3 by using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \). This gives \( x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2} \), which yields \( x = -1 \) or \( x = 3 \). Since neither of these solutions is greater than 3, there are no valid solutions in this case.

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, to find \( f^{-1}(6) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \). Again, we will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 6 \), which gives \( x = -3 \). This value is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), so it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \), which gives \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \). We can try to find the roots of this polynomial equation. By inspection or using the Rational Root Theorem, we can test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \) does not work, but testing \( x = 3 \) gives \( -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = -6 \neq 0 \), so \( x = 3 \) is not a solution. However, we can check \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) are not the only possible integer solutions, and we should verify if there are any other solutions greater than 3.

Since \( x = -3 \) is a valid solution for the first case, we have \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the inverse function values: \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from that point to the center of the octahedron and the vertices of the octahedron's circumscribed sphere.

Let's denote the center of the octahedron as $O$ and the distance from $P$ to $O$ as $d$. The distance from any vertex to the center of the octahedron is the same, and since the octahedron is regular, we can use the formula:

\[PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 3(AB^2) + 6d^2\]

However, for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is equal to 4 times the sum of the squares of the distances from that point to the center of the octahedron plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices. Since the octahedron is regular, the distance from the center to any vertex is the same, and we can simplify the problem.

However, we can use a simpler approach by noting that the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the vertices is equal to 4 times the square of the distance from $P$ to the center plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices, which is a constant for a regular octahedron.

The problem involves finding the ratio of Jen's candle wax to Jack's candle wax, given that the cost of the candles is proportional to the amount of wax they contain. We need to use the given costs and weights of the candles to determine this ratio.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the cost of the wax as $C$ and the amount of wax as $W$. The problem states that the cost of the candles is proportional to the amount of wax they contain, so we can write the equation as $C = kW$, where $k$ is the proportionality constant.

For the candle with a weight of 200g and a cost of $200, we can write the equation as $200 = k \cdot 200$. For the candle with a weight of 150g and a cost of $150, we can write the equation as $150 = k \cdot 150$.

Since the proportionality constant $k$ is the same for both candles, we can see that the cost per gram of wax is the same for both candles. This means that the ratio of the weights of the wax will be the same as the ratio of the costs.

Let's denote the weight of Jen's wax as $W_J$ and the weight of Jack's wax as $W_{Jack}$. The ratio of Jen's candle wax to Jack's candle wax is $\frac{W_J}{W_{Jack}}$.

Since the cost of the candles is proportional to the amount of wax, the ratio of the weights of the wax is the same as the ratio of the costs. Therefore, we can write the ratio as $\frac{W_J}{W_{Jack}} = \frac{200}{150} = \frac{4}{3}$.

First, we need to convert the decimal number 629 to its representations in base 7 and base 8.

To convert 629 to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

So, the representation of $629_{10}$ in base 7 is $1556_7$.

Next, to convert 629 to base 8, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
\begin{aligned}
629 \div 8 &= 78 \text{ R } 5 \\
78 \div 8 &= 9 \text{ R } 6 \\
9 \div 8 &= 1 \text{ R } 1 \\
1 \div 8 &= 0 \text{ R } 1 \\

So, the representation of $629_{10}$ in base 8 is $1165_8$.

The problem describes a scenario where a group of individuals (dewiniaid) are interacting in a social setting (arcanaidd). The conversation involves a question about the number of individuals present, and it is mentioned that each individual knows the number of others present but not their own. This implies that if there were only one person, they would know they are the only one and thus wouldn't say they don't know their number, as they would be certain of it. Similarly, if there were two people, each would see the other and know their number, as the other person doesn't know their number, indicating there must be another person.

The problem states that one of the conversation participants realized they had a certain number of legs, but it doesn't specify the number of legs. However, the key point is that this realization didn't change the fact that each person knows the number of others present but not their own.

[ADVANCE]

Let's assume the number of individuals is \( n \). Each person sees \( n-1 \) others and knows that the total number of individuals is \( n \), but they don't know their own number. If there were only 1 person, they would know they are the only one. If there were 2 people, each would see the other and know their number. If there were 3 people, each would see 2 others, and so on.

The realization of having a certain number of legs doesn't change the fact that each person knows the number of others present but not their own. This implies that the number of legs doesn't provide new information about the number of individuals. The only way this can happen is if the number of individuals is such that each person's observation of the others doesn't change their knowledge of the total number of individuals.

[ADVANCE]

Given the above reasoning, let's consider the possible number of individuals. If there were 1 person, they would know they are the only one. If there were 2 people, each would see the other and know their number. This pattern continues until we find a number where the realization of having legs doesn't change the situation.

The key insight is that if there are \( n \) people, each person sees \( n-1 \) others. The realization of having legs means that the person who realized it must have seen a certain number of legs that would lead them to conclude their own number. However, the problem states that this realization didn't change the fact that each person knows the number of others present but not their own.

This implies that the number of legs must be such that it doesn't provide new information about the number of individuals. The only way this can happen is if the number of individuals is 3. If there are 3 people, each person sees 2 others, and the realization of having legs doesn't change the fact that each person knows the number of others present but not their own.

[ADVANCE]

Let's verify this conclusion. If there are 3 people, each person sees 2 others. When one person realizes they have a certain number of legs, it doesn't change the fact that each person knows the number of others present but not their own. This is because the number of legs doesn't provide new information about the number of individuals.

The problem involves finding the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial $g(x)$, which is defined as $f(x-1)$, where $f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2$.

[ADVANCE]
To find the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial $p(x)$ is equal to $p(1)$. Therefore, we need to find $g(1)$, which is equivalent to $f(1-1) = f(0)$.

However, we can also find the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$ by substituting $x = 1$ into the expression for $g(x)$, which is $f(x-1)$. This means we need to evaluate $f(1-1) = f(0)$.

Let's calculate $f(0)$:
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

So, the sum of the coefficients of $g(x)$ is $-2$.

The problem requires finding the shortest distance from the point $(6, 0)$ to the line $y = 2x - 2$. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.

[ADVANCE]

The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line equation is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(6, 0)$, so $x_1 = 6$ and $y_1 = 0$. Now we can substitute these values into the distance formula:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:
\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

The problem involves finding the set of values for the expressions $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$ given that $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$ are the four distinct roots of the polynomial equation $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$.

We can use Vieta's formulas to relate the roots of the polynomial to the coefficients. For a polynomial $x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0$, Vieta's formulas tell us that:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -b = -2,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = c = 0,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -d = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = e = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$.

Let's denote these expressions as $a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. We know that:
\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2(-2) = -4.
\]

Since $a + b + c = 0$, we can consider the polynomial whose roots are $a, b, c$:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = t^3 + (ab+bc+ca)t + 4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:
\[
(ab+bc+ca) = \sum_{sym} \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

Thus, the polynomial simplifies to:
\[
t^3 + 4 = 0.
\]

The roots of this polynomial are the values of $a, b, c$. Solving $t^3 + 4 = 0$, we get:
\[
t^3 = -4 \implies t = \sqrt[3]{-4} = -\sqrt[3]{4}, \sqrt[3]{4} \left( \cos \frac{2\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{2\pi}{3} \right), \sqrt[3]{4} \left( \cos \frac{4\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{4\pi}{3} \right).

Let's denote the cost of a pencil as $p$ and the cost of a jumbo eraser as $e$. We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point within a rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. The rectangle has a point $O$ as its center, and the ratio of the lengths of the sides $AB$ and $AD$ is given as $k$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices. The perpendicular bisectors of the segments joining $O$ to each vertex will divide the rectangle into regions, and the points closer to $O$ will be within the region formed by the intersection of these bisectors.

The perpendicular bisectors of $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will form a smaller rectangle with its center at $O$ and with sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle. The distance from $O$ to the sides of this smaller rectangle will be half the length of the corresponding side of the original rectangle.

Let's assume the coordinates of $A$ are $(-a, b)$, $B$ are $(a, b)$, $C$ are $(a, -b)$, and $D$ are $(-a, -b)$. The center $O$ is at $(0, 0)$. The ratio $\frac{AB}{AD} = k$ implies $\frac{2a}{2b} = k$, so $a = kb$.

The area of the original rectangle is $AB \cdot AD = 2a \cdot 2b = 4ab = 4kb^2$.

The smaller rectangle, formed by the perpendicular bisectors, will have sides of length $a$ and $b$, so its area is $ab = kb^2$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle.

The probability is given by the ratio of the areas of the smaller rectangle to the original rectangle:

The function \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise, using the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \) for \( n \geq 4 \) and the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \) for \( n < 4 \).

We need to determine which part of the piecewise function to use for each value and then compute the corresponding \( f(n) \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), which is less than 4, we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), which is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), which is equal to 4, we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can sum the values of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \), \( f(\sqrt{45}) \), and \( f(8^{2/3}) \).

Sum the values:

The problem involves calculating the total amount of money won by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie, and then determining how much each person will contribute to the charity after they share the total amount equally.

- Linda: $\$27.47$
- Sherry: $\$35.23$
- June: $\$37.37$
- Connie: $\$26.52$

We will sum these amounts to find the total.

Next, we will divide the total amount by 4 to find out how much each person will have after sharing the money equally.

Then, we will subtract each person's share from their original amount to find out how much each person will contribute to the charity.

Finally, we will sum the contributions to the charity to find the total amount donated.

Let's perform the calculations step by step.

[ADVANCE]
First, we calculate the total amount of money won:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]
Next, we divide the total amount by 4 to find out how much each person will have after sharing the money equally:
\[
\frac{126.59}{4} = 31.6475
\]
Since we need to find the amount each person will contribute to the charity, we subtract each person's share from their original amount:
- Linda's contribution: $27.47 - 31.6475 = -4.1775$
- Sherry's contribution: $35.23 - 31.6475 = 3.5825$
- June's contribution: $37.37 - 31.6475 = 5.7225$
- Connie's contribution: $26.52 - 31.6475 = -5.1275$
Since negative contributions don't make sense in this context, we will consider the absolute values of the negative contributions as zero, meaning Linda and Connie will not contribute to the charity.

The total amount donated to the charity is the sum of the positive contributions:
\[
3.5825 + 5.7225 = 9.305

We need to round this amount to the nearest cent, as we are dealing with dollars and cents.

Rounding $9.305 to the nearest cent gives us $9.31. To present the answer in the required format, we need to convert the amount to cents. Since $1 is equal to 100 cents, we multiply $9.31 by 100:

The problem involves comparing the number of times Jim and Martha can draw a certain length from a beam of wood. The beam is 300 troddedfedd long and 400 troddedfedd wide. Jim can draw any length up to the width of the beam, while Martha can only draw lengths that are multiples of the length she draws.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's calculate the number of times Jim can draw a length of 300 troddedfedd from the beam. Since Jim can draw any length up to the width of the beam, he can draw 400/300 = 1.33 times, but since he can't draw a fraction of a time, we take the floor value, which is 1 time.

Next, let's calculate the number of times Martha can draw a length of 300 troddedfedd from the beam. Since Martha can only draw lengths that are multiples of the length she draws, she can draw 400/300 = 1.33 times, but again, we take the floor value, which is 1 time.

However, we need to consider that Martha can draw other lengths as well. Let's calculate the number of times Martha can draw different lengths:
- For a length of 1 troddedfedd, she can draw 400 times.
- For a length of 2 troddedfedd, she can draw 200 times.
- For a length of 4 troddedfedd, she can draw 100 times.
- For a length of 5 troddedfedd, she can draw 80 times.
- For a length of 10 troddedfedd, she can draw 40 times.
- For a length of 20 troddedfedd, she can draw 20 times.
- For a length of 25 troddedfedd, she can draw 16 times.
- For a length of 50 troddedfedd, she can draw 8 times.
- For a length of 100 troddedfedd, she can draw 4 times.
- For a length of 125 troddedfedd, she can draw 3 times.
- For a length of 250 troddedfedd, she can draw 1 time.
- For a length of 300 troddedfedd, she can draw 1 time.

The maximum number of times Martha can draw is 400 times for a length of 1 troddedfedd.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find out how many more times Martha can draw than Jim. Since Jim can draw 1 time and Martha can draw 400 times, the difference is 400 - 1 = 399.

However, we need to consider the context of the problem again. The problem asks for the number of times Martha can draw a length that is a multiple of the length she draws, and compare it to Jim's draws. We should focus on the length that Jim draws, which is 300 troddedfedd.

Martha can draw 300 troddedfedd 1 time, and she can also draw other lengths that are multiples of 300, but the problem is asking for the comparison of the number of draws, not the length. So, we need to recalculate the number of times Martha can draw a length that is a multiple of 300.

Martha can draw 300 troddedfedd 1 time, and she can also draw other lengths that are multiples of 3, such as 600 (which is not possible since the beam is only 400 troddedfedd wide), so we only consider the length 300.

Jim can draw 300 troddedfedd 1 time, and Martha can draw 300 troddedfedd 1 time. But we need to consider other lengths that Martha can draw, such as 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250.

The total number of times Martha can draw is 400 (for length 1) + 200 (for length 2) + 100 (for length 4) + 80 (for length 5) + 40 (for length 10) + 20 (for length 20) + 16 (for length 25) + 8 (for length 50) + 4 (for length 100) + 3 (for length 125) + 1 (for length 250) + 1 (for length 300) = 1023.

But the problem is asking for the number of times Martha can draw a length that is a multiple of the length she draws, and compare it to Jim's draws. We should focus on the length that Jim draws, which is 300 troddedfedd.

Martha can draw 300 troddedfedd 1 time, and the total number of times Martha can draw is more than Jim.

The difference is 1023 - 1 = 1022, but we need to consider the context of the problem again. The problem is asking for the number of times Martha can draw a length that is a multiple of the length she draws, and compare it to Jim's draws.

Since Jim can draw 1 time, and Martha can draw 1 time for the length 300, the problem is actually asking for the number of times Martha can draw a length that is a multiple of 300, which is 1 time.

But we need to consider the other lengths that Martha can draw, and compare it to Jim's draws.

The correct answer is the difference between the total number of times Martha can draw and the number of times Jim can draw.

Let's recalculate the correct answer.

The correct answer is $\boxed{399}$.

We are given that $\omega$ is a complex number such that $\omega^3 = 1$. We need to find the possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}$. These roots satisfy the equation $\omega^3 - 1 = 0$, which can be factored as $(\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0$. Since $\omega \neq 1$, we have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

We can use this equation to simplify the given expression. Let's calculate $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$.

[ADVANCE]

We can find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]
Since $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, we have:
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the value of the expression is $\boxed{1}$.

The problem asks for the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points before returning to the starting point.

We need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the shortest possible route that visits all points and returns to the starting point.

The given distances are:
- $AB = 6$
- $AC = 6$
- $AD = 5$
- $BC = 5$
- $BD = 3$
- $CD = 4$

We can use the concept of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to find the shortest route. However, since there are only 4 points, we can also consider all possible routes and calculate their total distances.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We will calculate the total distance for each possible route starting and ending at each point. There are $4! = 24$ possible permutations of the points, but we can reduce this by considering the symmetry of the problem and the fact that the route is a cycle.

Let's calculate the total distance for each route:

1. Starting at $A$: $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$
   - Distance: $AB + BC + CD + DA = 6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20$
2. Starting at $A$: $A \to B \to D \to C \to A$
   - Distance: $AB + BD + DC + CA = 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 19$
3. Starting at $A$: $A \to C \to B \to D \to A$
   - Distance: $AC + CB + BD + DA = 6 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 19$
4. Starting at $A$: $A \to C \to D \to B \to A$
   - Distance: $AC + CD + DB + BA = 6 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 19$
5. Starting at $A$: $A \to D \to B \to C \to A$
   - Distance: $AD + DB + BC + CA = 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19$
6. Starting at $A$: $A \to D \to C \to B \to A$
   - Distance: $AD + DC + CB + BA = 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20$

We can see that the shortest distance is 19, which occurs for several routes.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points before returning to the starting point is $\boxed{19}$.
