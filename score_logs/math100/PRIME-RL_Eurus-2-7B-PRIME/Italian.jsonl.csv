We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of $DE$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can substitute the given value of $\sin D$ and the length of $EF$ to find the length of $DF$. We have:
\[
\sin D = 0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($DF$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($DE$ and $EF$). Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

[OUTPUT]

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

# We need to find the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in the counterclockwise direction, denoted as $w$.

# To find $w$, we need to calculate $z - c$ first.
# $z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i$.

# Now, we multiply $z - c$ by the rotation factor: $(z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$.

The problem asks us to simplify $\sqrt{242}$. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root by taking out any perfect squares.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root by taking out the perfect square:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem involves arranging 8 people around a round table, with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We need to account for the circular permutation and the fact that the 3 people can be arranged among themselves.

[ADVANCE]

1. Treat the 3 people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) as a single block, since they must sit together. This reduces the problem to arranging 6 entities (the block and the remaining 5 individuals) around a round table.
2. The number of ways to arrange \(n\) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). So, the number of ways to arrange the 6 entities (the block and the remaining 5 individuals) around the round table is \((6-1)! = 5!\).
3. Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways.
4. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the round table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, is \(5! \times 3!\).

[ADVANCE]

1. Calculate \(5!\): \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).
2. Calculate \(3!\): \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term where the power of \(x\) is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}x^{3(5-k)}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{-2k}
\]
Simplifying the exponents of \(x\), we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-5k}
\]
For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term, we get:
\[

Simplifying further, we have:
\[
\binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. However, we can directly use the congruence to simplify the expression $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$.

We have:
\[ n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

So, the expression $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is congruent to $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we calculate the product:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \]
\[ 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

The problem involves finding the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to coincide with its original position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and the sum of the internal angles of a pentagon is given by $(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ$. The internal angle of each vertex of a regular pentagon is $\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ$.

However, to find the minimum degrees of rotation to coincide with the original position, we need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it looks the same after a rotation of $\frac{360^\circ}{5}$.

The minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is $\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ$.

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram, given the coordinates of the other three vertices. We can use the property of parallelograms that the diagonals bisect each other to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

The given coordinates are $(5, 3)$, $(6, 8)$, $(7, 4)$, and $(x, y)$, with the condition that $x > 7$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$ is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$.

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$ is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$ is the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving these equations, we get:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Since $x > 7$, the solution $x = 8$ and $y = 9$ satisfies the condition.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the coordinates of the fourth vertex as $(8, 9)$, we can find the value of $x + y$:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

We are given a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with $\angle B = 90^\circ$, and the relationship $\sin A = 2\cos A$. We need to find the value of $\tan A$.

[ADVANCE]

We know that $\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ and $\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$. This simplifies to $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$.

We also know that $\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$. Using the relationship we found, $\tan A = \frac{2 \cdot \text{adjacent}}{\text{adjacent}} = 2$.

([ADVANCE])

We can also verify this using the trigonometric identity $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$. Given $\sin A = 2\cos A$, we can substitute this into the identity to get $\tan A = \frac{2\cos A}{\cos A} = 2$.

Therefore, the value of $\tan A$ is $\boxed{2}$.

The problem involves finding the asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and then calculating the sum of the asymptotes' values.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression to find its roots.

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

Setting the factored form equal to zero, we get:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), where \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), which means \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can calculate the sum \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

The problem asks us to calculate the value of $99^2 + 99 + 1$ mentally. We need to find a way to simplify this expression to make it easier to compute.

[ADVANCE]

We can start by recognizing that $99^2 + 99 + 1$ is close to the expression $(99+1)^2$, but not quite. Let's rewrite the expression to see if we can simplify it:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \left(99 + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}.\]
However, this approach seems to be making the calculation more complicated. Instead, let's try to use the fact that $99$ is close to $100$ to simplify the calculation.

We can calculate $99^2$ as $(100-1)^2$:
\[99^2 = (100-1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.\]
Now, we can substitute this value back into the original expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9901.\]

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

We can use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) to simplify the numerator:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

12t^4 + (3b+20)t^3 + (5b-6+4a)t^2 + (ab-10)t - 2a

We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can set up the following equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26

We can solve the equation $-2a = 6$ to find the value of $a$:
\[

\[
-3b - 10 = -16

\[
-3b = -6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]
We can verify our values of $a$ and $b$ by substituting them into the other equations. First, substitute $b = 2$ into the equation $3b + 20 = 26$:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]
This equation holds true. Next, substitute $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into the equation $5b - 6 + 4a = -8$:
\[
5(2) - 6 + 4(-3) = 10 - 6 - 12 = -8

This equation also holds true. Therefore, our values of $a$ and $b$ are correct.

The problem involves finding the radius of a cylindrical serbatoio (water tank) given the rate at which it is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rising.

We are given:
- The rate at which the serbatoio is being filled with water is $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour.
- The rate at which the water level is rising is 4 meters per hour.

We need to find the radius of the serbatoio.

[ADVANCE]

The volume $V$ of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.

Since the water is being added at a rate of $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour, we can express this as $\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi$.

The water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so we can express this as $\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$.

Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we can differentiate both sides with respect to time $t$ to get:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
We can simplify this equation to solve for $r$:
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2
\]
Dividing both sides by $4\pi$, we get:
\[
r^2 = 5
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

[OUTPUT]

The radius of the serbatoio is $\boxed{\sqrt{5}}$ meters.

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the given circle equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1. To solve this, we need to rewrite the circle equation in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

[ADVANCE]

To rewrite the equation in standard form, we need to complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

1. Start with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

2. Rearrange the terms to complete the square:
\[ (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) = -c \]

3. Complete the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

4. Complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

5. Substitute the completed square terms back into the equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = -c \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 = -c \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the radius of the circle is given as 1, we can set \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

Now, solve for \( c \):

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the given conditions, we need to analyze the equation $f(f(x)) = x$. First, let's compute $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
We want $f(f(x)) = x$, so we set up the equation:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
This equation is quite complex, so let's simplify it step by step. We can start by considering the case where $f(x) = x$, and then exclude those values of $x$ for which $f(x) = x$ but $f(f(x)) = x$.

The equation $f(x) = x$ gives:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
This equation has solutions $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$. Since we are looking for $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$, we need to exclude these values.

Next, we substitute $y = \lambda x(1 - x)$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = x$:
\[f(y) = x \implies \lambda y(1 - y) = x.\]
Since $y = \lambda x(1 - x)$, we substitute this back into the equation:
\[\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.\]
We can simplify this equation by considering the quadratic nature of $f(x)$. Let's solve for $\lambda$ by examining the fixed points and the behavior of the function.

We need to find the values of $\lambda$ for which the equation $\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$. We can start by considering the case where $x \neq 0$ and $x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$.

Let's rewrite the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ as:
\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
For $x \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $x$:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
We need to find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy this equation for some $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$.

Next, we can analyze the quadratic equation $f(x) = x$ and the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ to find the range of $\lambda$. We know that the function $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ is a quadratic function, and its fixed points are $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$.

To find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the given conditions, we need to ensure that the equation $\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1$ has a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$.

After solving the equation, we find that the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the given conditions are $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 4$.

The problem requires finding the measure in degrees of the smallest positive angle $\theta$ for which the given equation involving trigonometric functions holds. We need to simplify the expression for $\tan \theta$.

[ADVANCE]

We start with the given expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the expression. Notice that $\cos 50^\circ = \cos (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$ and $\cos 35^\circ = \cos (90^\circ - 55^\circ) = \sin 55^\circ$. However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the given expression can be simplified using the angle addition formula for cosine and sine.

Rewriting the expression, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \sin 55^\circ \sin 40^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the terms. However, a simpler approach is to notice that the expression can be rewritten using the angle addition formula.

After careful examination, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ)}{\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{85^\circ - 25^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ.
\]
Substituting these into the expression for $\tan \theta$, we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
Since $\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}$, the smallest positive angle $\theta$ is in the second quadrant, and we know that $\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the measure of the smallest positive angle $\theta$ is $120^\circ$.

where \(n\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

- Frequency of E, \(n_2 = 2\)
- Frequency of I, \(n_3 = 1\)
- Frequency of P, \(n_4 = 1\)

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

Thus, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \). We can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

Given $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, we can calculate the cross product:

\[ \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 = z^4 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^4} \implies z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = (a - 1)^2 - 2 = a^2 - 2a + 1 - 2 = a - 2a = -a + 1. \]

We can continue this process to find \( z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} \):
\[ \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right)^2 = z^8 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^8} \implies z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = (-a + 1)^2 - 2 = a^2 - 2a + 1 - 2 = -a - 1. \]

We notice a pattern in the powers of \( z + \frac{1}{z} \). To find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we can use the fact that the sequence of \( z^{2^n} + \frac{1}{z^{2^n}} \) follows a periodic pattern due to the properties of the golden ratio.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that the golden ratio \( a \) satisfies \( a^2 = a + 1 \) to find the periodicity. We have:
\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = a, \]
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a - 1, \]
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = -a + 1, \]
\[ z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = -a - 1, \]
\[ z^{16} + \frac{1}{z^{16}} = a, \]
and the sequence repeats every 6 terms (since \( z^{32} + \frac{1}{z^{32}} = a - 1 \), and so on).

Since \( 85 = 6 \cdot 14 + 1 \), we have:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^{6 \cdot 14 + 1} + \frac{1}{z^{6 \cdot 14 + 1}} = z + \frac{1}{z} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

We are given an arithmetic sequence where the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500. We need to find the sixth term of the sequence.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence as \(a\) and the common difference as \(d\). The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

Given that the fourth term is 200, we can write:
\[a + 3d = 200 \quad \text{(1)}\]

Given that the eighth term is 500, we can write:
\[a + 7d = 500 \quad \text{(2)}\]

We can solve these two equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(d\).

[ADVANCE]

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \(a\):
\[(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now, substitute \(d = 75\) back into equation (1) to find \(a\):

\[a + 225 = 200\]
\[a = -25\]

Now that we have \(a = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term of the sequence:
\[a_6 = a + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]

[ADVANCE]

The denominator $2^2 \cdot 5^7$ can be rewritten as $2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot \frac{2^5}{2^5} = \frac{2^7 \cdot 5^7}{2^5} = \frac{10^7}{2^5}$. Therefore, the fraction becomes $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{10^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}$.

The problem asks for the number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150. To solve this, we need to find the common factors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers.

\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

Next, we will determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 by taking the lowest power of each prime factor that appears in both factorizations:

[ADVANCE]

To determine the possible values of $n$, we start by expressing $2^{24}$ as a perfect $n$th power. This means $2^{24} = k^n$ for some integer $k$. Since $2^{24}$ is a power of 2, $k$ must also be a power of 2, say $k = 2^m$ for some integer $m$. Therefore, we have:
\[2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn}.\]
This implies that $mn = 24$. We need to find all pairs of integers $(m, n)$ such that $mn = 24$ and $n > 1$.

[ADVANCE]

Now, we list all the factors of 24:
\[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\]
Since $n > 1$, we exclude $n = 1$ from the list. The possible values of $n$ are the factors of 24 excluding 1, which are:
\[2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\]
For each of these values of $n$, there exists a corresponding integer $m$ such that $mn = 24$. Therefore, the number of integers $n > 1$ for which $2^{24}$ is a perfect $n$th power is the number of factors of 24 excluding 1.

[ADVANCE]

Counting the number of factors of 24 excluding 1, we have:
\[2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\]
There are 7 such factors.

The problem involves selecting two numbers at random from the first six prime numbers and finding the probability that their sum is even. The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

[ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that the sum of the two selected numbers is even, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.

Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the remaining five numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, and 13) are odd.

[ADVANCE]

We can calculate the total number of possible outcomes when two numbers are selected from the six prime numbers. This is given by the product of the number of choices for each selection, which is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the two selected numbers is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.

Since there is only one even number (2), the number of ways to choose two even numbers is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).

The number of ways to choose two odd numbers is \(5 \times 5 = 25\), since there are five odd numbers.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is \(1 + 25 = 26\).

[ADVANCE]

The probability that the sum of the two selected numbers is even is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. This probability is given by:

The prime factorization of 450 is:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least these prime factors. Since the number we are looking for has all zeros and one digit, it must be a number like 1000, 10000, etc., or a number with a single non-zero digit (which must be 1, 2, 3, etc.) followed by zeros.

Given that the number must be a multiple of 450, we can start by checking the smallest numbers that fit the description and are multiples of 450.

We need to find the smallest number of the form $1000\ldots0$ or $1000\ldots0k$ (where $k$ is a single non-zero digit) that is a multiple of 450. Since the number must be divisible by $2$, $3^2$, and $5^2$, we can start by checking the divisibility of numbers of the form $1000\ldots0$.

The number $1000$ is $2^3 \times 5^3$, which includes the factor $2$ and $5^3$, but it is not divisible by $3^2$. The next number to check is $10000$, but it is also not divisible by $3^2$.

We need to find a number that includes the factors $2$, $3^2$, and $5^2$. The smallest number that fits this description is $10000 = 2^4 \times 5^4$, but it is not divisible by $3^2$. We need to multiply $10000$ by $9$ to include the factor $3^2$, resulting in $90000$.

Let's check if $90000$ is indeed a multiple of 450:
\[ 90000 \div 450 = 200 \]
Since $90000$ is divisible by 450, it is a valid solution.

We have found that $90000$ is a multiple of 450, and it is of the form that has all zeros and one digit (in this case, the digit 9). We need to verify that this is indeed the smallest such number.

We can check smaller numbers of the form $1000\ldots0$ or $1000\ldots0k$ to ensure that $90000$ is the smallest valid number. However, since we have systematically checked the necessary factors and ensured that $90000$ meets the criteria, it is likely to be the smallest such number.

Additionally, we can confirm that any smaller number would not have enough factors of $2$, $3^2$, and $5^2$ to be a multiple of 450.

Therefore, our solution appears to be correct, and we can conclude that the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and one is indeed $90000$.

The chessboard has 4 columns and 5 rows, resulting in a total of 20 possible outcomes. The columns are determined by the remainders when the first number is divided by 4, and the rows are determined by the remainders when the second number is divided by 5.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that the peg lands on a shaded square, we need to identify the shaded squares on the chessboard and count the number of favorable outcomes.

Assuming the chessboard is colored in a checkerboard pattern, the shaded squares will be alternating between shaded and unshaded. We can list the columns and rows as follows:

Columns: 1, 2, 3 (since the remainders when divided by 4 are 1, 2, 3)
Rows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (since the remainders when divided by 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

The shaded squares on a standard chessboard pattern would be:
- Column 1: Rows 2, 4
- Column 2: Rows 1, 3, 5
- Column 3: Rows 2, 4

So, the favorable outcomes are:

- (Column 3, Row 2), (Column 3, Row 4)

[ADVANCE]

First, let's calculate the value of the denominator:
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000.\]

\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
So, $(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}$.

Now, we can substitute this back into our expression:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

The problem involves identifying the geometric shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) represents the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis, \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane measured from the positive \(x\)-axis, and \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height \(z\) is constant, regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This means that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is the same.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since the \(z\)-coordinate is constant and the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\) can vary freely, the equation \(z = c\) describes a surface that extends infinitely in the radial and angular directions, but remains at a fixed height above the \(xy\)-plane. This surface is a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane.

Therefore, the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates represents a plane.

We need to find the smallest possible angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. We can calculate the magnitude of the cross product as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta = (2)(7) \sin \theta = 14 \sin \theta.
\]
Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.

The problem involves two polynomial functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the polynomial $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$. The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term and $a$ is the leading coefficient.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, we can substitute $x + 5$ into the function $f(x)$ to get the expression for $g(x)$. However, we don't need to expand the entire expression for $g(x)$ to find the sum of its roots. Instead, we can use the property of polynomial roots that the sum of the roots of $f(x + c)$ is equal to the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ minus $nc$, where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial.

The sum of the roots of $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ is given by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $-(-49) = 49$. Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$ and the degree of the polynomial is 3, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 3 \cdot 5 = 49 - 15 = 34$.

The problem involves finding the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$. We need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, which is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$. The sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. Since the sum of all the interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, the measure of the remaining angle is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}$. Since this is an interior angle of a convex polygon, its measure must be less than $180^{\circ}$.

We can set up the following equation:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}.
\]
Simplifying the inequality, we get:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ}.
\]
Dividing both sides by $180^{\circ}$, we obtain:
\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}.
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
n-2 < 6.9444.
\]
Adding 2 to both sides, we find:
\[
n < 8.9444.
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, the possible values for $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. However, we need to find the exact value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.

We also know that the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$, and the sum of all the interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$. Therefore, the measure of the remaining angle is:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}.
\]
This angle must be greater than 0 and less than $180^{\circ}$. We can set up the following equation to find the exact value of $n$:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x,
\]
where $0 < x < 180^{\circ}$. We can try the possible values of $n$ to find the one that satisfies the equation.

Let's try $n = 8$:
\[
(8-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 6 \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1080^{\circ}.
\]
The measure of the remaining angle is:
\[
1080^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} = 10^{\circ},
\]
which is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon.

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is $8$.

[ADVANCE]

We can express the congruence as:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) into the equation \( t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \), we get:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
or
\[ t \equiv -1 - 5 \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
Substituting \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \) into the equation \( t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \), we get:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
or
\[ t \equiv -1 - 18 \equiv -19 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
So, the possible values of \( t \) are 4 and 17. Since we are looking for an odd integer, the solution is \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}\) is \(\left( -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\), we can simplify the expression inside the sine function.

For \(x > 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

For \(x < 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]

However, we can use the identity \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

So, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), we have a contradiction because \(1 \neq \frac{1}{3}\). This means our initial assumption or simplification might be incorrect, or there might be a restriction we need to consider.

Let's re-evaluate the problem by directly using the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
\sin (a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b.
\]

Applying this to our problem:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) \cos \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) + \cos \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) \sin \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right).
\]

We know that \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\), \(\cos \left( \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\), \(\sin \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\), and \(\cos \left( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\).

Substituting these values, we get:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} = \frac{x^2}{x^2+1} + \frac{1}{x^2+1} = \frac{x^2+1}{x^2+1} = 1.
\]

This again leads to a contradiction because \(1 \neq \frac{1}{3}\). We need to recheck the problem statement and our steps.

However, we can also consider the possibility that the equation might not have a real solution. Let's verify this by solving the equation numerically or by re-evaluating the trigonometric identity.

After re-evaluation, we can conclude that the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) does not have a real solution because the left-hand side of the equation is always 1, which does not equal \(\frac{1}{3}\).

The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since the lines are parallel, \(\mathbf{d_2} = 2\mathbf{d_1}\), meaning they are scalar multiples of each other.

We can choose a point on each line, say \(\mathbf{p_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and \(\mathbf{p_2} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) on the second line.

The problem asks for the number of points with integer coordinates that are strictly inside a given rectangular region. The vertices of the rectangle are $(5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4)$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the number of points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle, we need to determine the range of $x$ and $y$ coordinates that lie within the rectangle. The $x$-coordinates of the vertices range from $-5$ to $5$, and the $y$-coordinates range from $-4$ to $4$. However, since we are looking for points strictly inside the rectangle, we exclude the boundary points.

The valid range for $x$ is from $-4$ to $4$ (since $-5$ and $5$ are on the boundary), and the valid range for $y$ is from $-3$ to $3$ (since $-4$ and $4$ are on the boundary).

The number of integer values for $x$ within the range $-4$ to $4$ is $4 - (-4) + 1 = 9$. The number of integer values for $y$ within the range $-3$ to $3$ is $3 - (-3) + 1 = 7$.

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible $x$ values by the number of possible $y$ values: $9 \times 7 = 63$.

\]
We need to calculate $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$.

[ADVANCE]

Using the properties of the cross product, we can expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ as follows:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
We know that $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, so the expression simplifies to:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]
We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so we can substitute the given values:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

Substituting the given values for the cross products, we get:

The problem involves finding the average price of Juan's French stamps from the '70s. The prices of the stamps are given as follows: Brazil (6 cents), France (6 cents), Peru (4 cents), and Spain (5 cents). The number of stamps from each country for the '70s is: Brazil (12), France (12), Peru (6), and Spain (13).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the average price of Juan's French stamps from the '70s, we need to calculate the total cost of the French stamps and then divide by the total number of French stamps.

The price of each French stamp is 6 cents, and the number of French stamps from the '70s is 12. So, the total cost of the French stamps is $6 \times 12 = 72$ cents.

The total number of French stamps is 12. Therefore, the average price of the French stamps is $\frac{72}{12} = 6$ cents.

Since the problem asks for the average price rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent, we can conclude that the average price is already a whole number, so no rounding is needed.

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ bisects the angle $\angle BAD$. We also know that the area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects the angle $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, we can conclude that $\triangle ACB \cong \triangle ACD$ by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) postulate. This is because $\angle BAC = \angle CAD$ (since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$), $\angle ACB = \angle ACD = 90^\circ$ (since $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$), and $\overline{AC}$ is a common side.

Since $\triangle ACB \cong \triangle ACD$, the areas of these two triangles are equal. Let's denote the area of $\triangle ACD$ as $x$. Then the area of $\triangle ACB$ is also $x$.

The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ACB$. Therefore, we have:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ACB] = x + x = 2x
\]
We are given that $[ABCD] = 42$, so we can set up the equation:
\[
2x = 42

The problem is to solve the equation $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$ for $x$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we can cross-multiply to clear the fractions:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

Now, we can isolate $x$ by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-19x = -9
\]

Finally, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by $-19$:
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

We need to verify that this solution satisfies the original equation, specifically that the expression under the square root is non-negative. We check that $3x-1 > 0$:
\[
3\left(\frac{9}{19}\right) - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0

Since $x = \frac{9}{19}$ satisfies the condition, it is a valid solution.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We will substitute the given fractions into the operation definition. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Plugging these values into the operation definition, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]
Now, we will perform the multiplication and simplify the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, we multiply the numbers:
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]
Next, we simplify the fraction $\frac{21}{30}$. The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]
Now, we multiply 70 by $\frac{7}{10}$:
\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right) = \frac{70 \cdot 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

The problem involves determining the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, intersect when selected from points on a circle.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of geometric probability and the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. When four points are chosen on a circle, the probability that the chords formed by connecting pairs of these points intersect is equivalent to the probability that the four points are arranged such that one pair of points is separated by the other pair when moving around the circle.

Consider the four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ on the circle. For the chords $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating manner when moving around the circle, i.e., the points must be in the order $A, C, B, D$ or $A, D, B, C$ when traveling around the circle.

The total number of ways to arrange four points on a circle is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form one chord, which is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$. However, only 2 of these arrangements (the alternating ones) result in intersecting chords.

Therefore, the probability that the chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\frac{2}{3}$.

The problem involves finding the measure of angle $\angle ADC$ in a diagram with two concentric circles, one with a radius of 1 and the other with a radius of 2. The area of the shaded region is given as $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle. We need to use the given information to find the measure of $\angle ADC$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The area of the larger circle is $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$. The area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, which is $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.

The area of the shaded region can also be expressed as the difference between the area of the sector of the larger circle and the area of the sector of the smaller circle. Let the measure of $\angle ADC$ be $\theta$ (in radians). The area of the sector of the larger circle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 \cdot \theta = 2\theta$, and the area of the sector of the smaller circle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta$. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $2\theta - \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{3}{2}\theta$.

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Solving for $\theta$, we get:
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{9}
\]
Since the problem asks for the measure of $\angle ADC$ in degrees, we convert $\theta$ from radians to degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = 200^\circ
\]
However, the problem asks for the measure of the smaller angle $\angle ADC$, which is the smaller angle subtended by the same arc. Since the full circle is $360^\circ$, the smaller angle is:
\[
360^\circ - 200^\circ = 160^\circ
\]
But we need to verify if this is the correct interpretation of the problem.

Next action: [VERIFY]

We need to verify if the calculated angle is indeed the correct answer. The problem states that the area of the shaded region is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, and we have correctly calculated the area of the shaded region as $\frac{3}{2}\theta$. The equation $\frac{3}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}$ seems correct, and the conversion from radians to degrees is also correct.

However, we should consider if there are any other possible interpretations or solutions. Given the symmetry and the concentric nature of the circles, the calculated angle seems to be the correct solution.

Using the angle sum and difference identities for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha

We also know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we can substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}

\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{25} = \frac{5\sqrt{21} - 4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}

Next, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}\right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})\sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2\sqrt{63} + 21}{500} = \frac{2 \cdot 3\sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{6\sqrt{7} + 21}{500}

However, we can simplify this problem using the product-to-sum identities. We know that:
\[
\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) - \cos (A + B)]
\]
Let \(A = \alpha + \beta\) and \(B = \beta - \alpha\), then:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos ((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha)) - \cos ((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha))] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2\alpha) - \cos (2\beta)]
\]
We also know that \(\cos (2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\), so:
\[
\cos (2\alpha) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

\[
\cos (2\beta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Now, substitute these values back into the equation:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.18 = 0.09

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the total of 14 members (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats). Then, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats.

The total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from 14 members is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of members and $k$ is the number of members to be chosen.

The total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from 14 members is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans. This is the number of ways to choose 5 members from 8 Republicans:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

We also calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Democrats. This is the number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 Democrats:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6

Since we are looking for integers, both \(n = 5\) and \(n = -5\) are potential solutions. We need to check which set of consecutive integers satisfies the original product condition.

For \(n = 5\), the consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\). Their product is:
\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]
This satisfies the condition.

For \(n = -5\), the consecutive integers are \(-6, -5, -4\). Their product is:
\[
(-6) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-4) = -120
\]
This does not satisfy the condition since the product is -120, not 120.

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \(4, 5, 6\), and the largest of these integers is 6.

The problem is to find the largest of three consecutive integers whose product is 120, and the product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24. We denoted the integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\), and used the given conditions to form equations. Solving these equations, we found that \(n = 5\) is the valid solution, corresponding to the integers \(4, 5, 6\). Therefore, the largest of these integers is \(\boxed{6}\).

The problem requires solving for the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Since we are asked for the positive value of \( x \), we select \( x = 66 \).

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} - 2 \pi \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

So the expression becomes \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\) to simplify the expression. Let's pair the terms and use the identity \(\cos x \cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x \cos x = -\frac{1}{2} (\cos (2x) + 1)\).

However, a more efficient approach is to use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{1}{8} \sin 16x / \sin x.
\]
We can apply this identity by setting \(x = \frac{2\pi}{15}\), then we have:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16 \cdot 2 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{\sin \left( \frac{32 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}.

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{32 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( 2 \pi + \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)\), the expression simplifies to:
\[

We are given an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with $AB = AC$ and altitude $AM = 11$. There is a point $D$ on $\overline{AM}$ such that $AD = 10$ and $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$. We need to find the perimeter of triangle $ABC$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote $\angle BAC = \theta$, then $\angle BDC = 3\theta$. Since $AM$ is the altitude, $\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ$. We can use the fact that $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$ to find a relationship between the angles.

Since $\angle BDC = 3\theta$ and $\angle BDC$ is an exterior angle to $\triangle ABM$, we can write:
\[
\angle BDC = \angle BAM + \angle ABM = \theta + \angle ABM
\]
Since $\angle ABM = 90^\circ - \theta$, we have:
\[
3\theta = \theta + 90^\circ - \theta = 90^\circ - \theta
\]
Solving for $\theta$, we get:
\[
3\theta = 90^\circ - \theta \implies 4\theta = 90^\circ \implies \theta = 22.5^\circ
\]

Next, we can use the tangent function to find the length of $BM$. Let $BM = x$. Then:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}
\]
and
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{BD}{DM} = \frac{BD}{1}
\]
Since $BD = BM \tan 3\theta$ and $DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1$, we have:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{x \tan 3\theta}{1} = x \tan 3\theta
\]
Using the triple angle formula for tangent, $\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}$, we can substitute $\tan \theta = \frac{x}{11}$:
\$
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{x}{11} - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^3}{1 - 3 \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}} = \frac{3x \cdot 121 - x^3}{121 \cdot 11 - 3x^2 \cdot 11} = \frac{363x - x^3}{1331 - 33x^2}
\]
Since $\tan 3\theta = \frac{x \tan 3\theta}{1}$, we can set up the equation:
\$
\frac{363x - x^3}{1331 - 33x^2} = x \cdot \frac{363x - x^3}{1331 - 33x^2}
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\$
363x - x^3 = x(1331 - 33x^2)
\]
\$
363x - x^3 = 1331x - 33x^3

\$
32x^3 = 968x
\]
\$
x^2 = \frac{968}{32} = 30.25
\]
\$
x = \sqrt{30.25} = 5.5
\]
Now, we can find the length of $AB$ using the Pythagorean theorem:
\$
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + 5.5^2 = 121 + 30.25 = 151.25
\]
\$
AB = \sqrt{151.25} = \sqrt{\frac{605}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{605}}{2}

The perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is:
\$
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + 2BM = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{605}}{2} + 2 \cdot 5.5 = \sqrt{605} + 11

\$
\sqrt{605} = \sqrt{121 \cdot 5} = 11\sqrt{5}

The problem involves finding the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is $3^7$. Let's denote the first integer as $x$. Since the integers are consecutive, the sequence can be written as $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum is $3^7$, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the first and last term is $\frac{x + (x+26)}{2} = x+13$. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 3^7. \]

We can simplify this equation to solve for $x$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we calculate $3^7$:
\[ 3^7 = 2187. \]
Now, we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 2187. \]
Next, we solve for $x$:
\[ x+13 = \frac{2187}{27}, \]
\[ x+13 = 81, \]
\[ x = 81 - 13, \]
\[ x = 68. \]
The sequence of integers is $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$. Since there are 27 terms (an odd number), the median is the 14th term in the sequence, which is also the middle term.

[ADVANCE]

The median of the sequence is the 14th term, which can be calculated as:
\[ x + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81. \]

The problem requires finding the values of $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds. We need to break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factorize the quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where the product $(y + 7)(y - 3)$ is negative. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$ and $x^2 \geq 0$, we only consider the interval $0 \leq y < 3$. Substituting back $y = x^2$, we get $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which implies $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite it as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factorized as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ and it is equal to 0 only when $x^2 = -2$ (which has no real solutions), the inequality $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ is satisfied for all real $x$.

[SYNTHESIZE]

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the compound inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ is the intersection of the solutions to the individual inequalities. The solution to the first inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, and the solution to the second inequality is all real $x$. Therefore, the solution to the compound inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

\end{align*}
We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx.$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relation involving $s$ and $p$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We are given the equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor the left-hand side as:
\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z).\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = (xy + yz + zx)(x + y + z) - 3xyz.\]
Substituting $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$, we get:
\[p s - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[ps - 12 = 12,\]
so
\[ps = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\]
\[ps = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
so
\[s^3 = 64,\]
and therefore
\[s = 4.\]
Now, substituting $s = 4$ back into the equation $ps = 24$, we get:
\[4p = 24,\]
so
\[p = 6.\]
Thus, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $6$.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

The numerator is an absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative (or zero). The denominator is a quadratic expression \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).

To solve the inequality, we need to consider when the fraction is negative. Since the numerator is always non-negative, the fraction will be negative when the denominator is negative, except when the numerator is zero.

[ADVANCE]

1. Find the values of \(x\) that make the numerator zero: \(x^2 - 81 = 0 \implies x = \pm 9\).
2. Find the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero: \(x^2 - 36x = 0 \implies x(x - 36) = 0 \implies x = 0\) or \(x = 36\).
3. Determine the intervals where the denominator is negative: We need to solve \(x(x - 36) < 0\). The roots of the quadratic are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), so the intervals to consider are \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find that \(x(x - 36) < 0\) when \(0 < x < 36\).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to exclude the values of \(x\) that make the numerator zero (i.e., \(x = \pm 9\)) from the interval where the denominator is negative, because the fraction is undefined at these points.

Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \(0 < x < 36\), excluding \(x = 9\).

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's define:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
We need to find the critical points of $f(x)$ by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
Setting $f'(x) = 0$, we get:
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
This gives us the critical points:
\[ x = 0, \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Next, we need to evaluate $f(x)$ at these critical points to find the minimum value:
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, which occurs at $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the minimum distance $D$ is:
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The distance can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Thus, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. Therefore, the value of $a+b$ is $\boxed{12}$.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) and asked to find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \). To do this, we need to find the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum the corresponding \( x \)-values.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3-x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3+2x^2+3x & \text{if } x>3.
\end{array}
\right. \]

We will first find \( f^{-1}(0) \) by solving \( f(x) = 0 \) for both cases of the piecewise function.

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \), but neither of these satisfies the condition \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there is no valid solution for \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, we find \( f^{-1}(6) \) by solving \( f(x) = 6 \) for both cases of the piecewise function.

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
We can use numerical methods or inspection to find the roots of this cubic equation. By inspection, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not a solution since \( 2 \) is not greater than 3, and \( x = 3 \) is also not a solution for this case. We can try \( x = 6 \)：
\[ -6^3 + 2 \cdot 6^2 + 3 \cdot 6 - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \neq 0. \]
We can try \( x = 4 \):
\[ -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 - 6 = -64 + 32 + 12 - 6 = -26 \neq 0. \]
We can try \( x = 1.5 \) is not in the domain, so we try \( x = 6 \) again in the first case.
Since we have \( f(-3) = 6 \) for the first case, we don't need to solve the cubic equation.

So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to the other five vertices. We need to use the properties of a regular octahedron to solve this problem.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 4 other vertices. The distance between any two adjacent vertices is the same, say $s$. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant and equal to $4s^2 + 4d^2$, where $d$ is the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron.

Let the distances from point $P$ to the 6 vertices be $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$. We are given $a = 3, b = 7, c = 8, d = 9,$ and $e = 11$. We need to find $f$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the vertices is:
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 4s^2 + 4d^2.\]

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the vertices is constant. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is the same for any point.

We can also use the property that for a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is equal to $4s^2 + 4d^2$, but we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to $4s^2 + 4d^2 = 4s^2 + 4 \left(\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = 4s^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{s^2}{2} = 4s^2 + 2s^2 = 6s^2$.

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to $4s^2 + 4d^2 = 4s^2 + 4 \left(\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = 4s^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{s^2}{2} = 4s^2 + 2s^2 = 6s^2$, but we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the square of the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the vertices is constant, we can set up the equation:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + f^2 = 6s^2.\]

We also know that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is $6s^2/2 = 3s^2$.

However, we can simply use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the vertices is constant:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + f^2 = 6s^2.\]

We can calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324.\]

So, we have:
\[324 + f^2 = 6s^2.\]

We also know that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices is $3s^2$, and the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the square of the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron.

However, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from $P$ to the vertices is constant:

The problem involves comparing the accelerations of two objects (a softball and a baseball) given their masses and the fact that the force applied to each is the same. We need to use Newton's second law, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), or \( F = ma \).

Given:
- Mass of the softball, \( m_{soft} = 200 \) g
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{base} = 150 \) g
- The force applied to each ball is the same.

We are asked to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball.

[ADVANCE]

Since the force applied to each ball is the same, we can set up the equation:
\[ F_{soft} = F_{base} \]
\[ m_{soft} \cdot a_{soft} = m_{base} \cdot a_{base} \]
Substituting the given masses:
\[ 200 \cdot a_{soft} = 150 \cdot a_{base} \]
To find the ratio of the accelerations, we can rearrange the equation to solve for \( \frac{a_{soft}}{a_{base}} \):
\[ \frac{a_{soft}}{a_{base}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

The problem asks us to find the number of common digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number $629_{10}$.

First, we need to convert the decimal number $629_{10}$ to its base 7 and base 8 representations.

[ADVANCE]

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 4
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5

\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5

\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 7 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1554_7$.

To convert $629_{10}$ to base 8, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of $629_{10}$ is $1165_8$.

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the base 7 representation ($1554_7$) and the base 8 representation ($1165_8$) of $629_{10}$, we need to find the common digits between the two representations.

The digits in the base 7 representation are: 1, 5, 5, 4.
The digits in the base 8 representation are: 1, 1, 6, 5.

We can see that the digits 1 and 5 are common to both representations.

The problem involves counting the number of handshakes that occur at an event where there are 10 stregoni (guinea pigs) and an unknown number of seigie (witches) who are all friends with each other but hate the stregoni. The seigie shake hands with each of the 10 stregoni, but the stregoni do not shake hands with each other.

Since the number of seigie is not specified, we need to focus on the handshakes between the seigie and the stregoni. Each seigia shakes hands with all 10 stregoni, and there are no handshakes between the stregoni.

Let's assume there are $n$ seigie. Each seigia shakes hands with 10 stregoni, so the total number of handshakes is $n \times 10$. However, since we are not given the value of $n$, we need to reconsider the problem statement to see if we can derive the value of $n$ or if the problem is asking for a specific scenario.

Given the problem statement, it seems we need to find the number of handshakes between the seigie and the stregoni, but the number of seigie is not provided. However, if we assume the problem is asking for the handshakes in a general sense or there is an implicit number of seigie, we can proceed with the calculation.

Since the problem doesn't specify the number of seigie, let's assume the problem is asking for a general formula or a specific scenario where the number of seigie is implied. Given the problem's context, it seems the number of seigie is not crucial, and we can focus on the handshakes between the seigie and the stregoni.

Let's assume the problem is asking for the handshakes in a scenario where the number of seigie is 0, which means no seigie are present, and the only individuals are the stregoni. In this case, the number of handshakes would be 0 since the stregoni do not shake hands with each other.

However, if we consider the problem in a more general sense, we need more information about the number of seigie. Since the problem doesn't provide this information, we can assume the problem is asking for a specific scenario or a general formula.

Given the problem's context, it seems the correct interpretation is that the number of seigie is not provided, and we should consider the handshakes in a scenario where the number of seigie is implied to be 0 or not relevant to the final answer.

Let's calculate the handshakes assuming the problem is asking for the handshakes between the seigie and the strogeni, but the number of seigie is not provided. In this case, we can consider the problem as having 0 seigie, which means no handshakes occur between the seigie and the strogeni.

The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by:
\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
First, we need to rewrite the line equation $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. The standard form of the line is:
\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]
Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(x_1, y_1) = (6, 0)$. Now, we can substitute these values into the distance formula:
\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

p + q + r = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
Thus, we have $p + q + r = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

Next, we need to find the product of these expressions. We can use the fact that:
\[
(p + q + r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + qr + rp).
\]
Since $p + q + r = 0$, we have:
\[
0 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + qr + rp).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -2(pq + qr + rp).
\]
We also know that:
\[
pq + qr + rp = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Expanding this product is complex, so we will use the fact that the product of the roots taken two at a time is zero, and the product of all four roots is 2. We can use the symmetric properties of the roots to find the value of $pq + qr + rp$.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the product of the expressions:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2(-2) = -4.
\]
Since $pqr = -4$, and $p + q + r = 0$, we can solve for the values of $p, q, r$. The only way to satisfy these conditions is if the values of $p, q, r$ are the roots of the polynomial $t^3 - (p+q+r)t^2 + (pq+qr+rp)t - pqr = 0$, which simplifies to $t^3 + 4 = 0$. The roots of this polynomial are the cube roots of $-4$, which are $- \sqrt[3]{4}, - \sqrt[3]{4} \omega, - \sqrt[3]{4} \omega^2$, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

[ADVANCE]

The distinct values of the expressions are the cube roots of $-4$, which can be written as $- \sqrt[3]{4}, - \sqrt[3]{4} \omega, - \sqrt[3]{4} \omega^2$. However, since we are asked for the set of distinct values, we can write the answer in a simplified form.

The set of distinct values is $\{- \sqrt[3]{4}, - \sqrt[3]{4} \omega, - \sqrt[3]{4} \omega^2\}$, but in a more conventional form for such problems, we can express it as $\{- \sqrt[3]{4}\}$ since the other two are complex conjugates and the problem does not distinguish between them.

However, the problem asks for the set of distinct values, and we should present it in the required format.

We need to determine the cost of a matite (pen) in cents. We are given two equations based on the cost of matite and a jumbo eraser:

The problem requires finding the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$.

[ADVANCE]

To find the decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$, we can perform the division. However, since we are only interested in the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point, we can also consider the fractional part of the number after converting it to a decimal.

First, let's convert $\frac{137}{500}$ to a decimal by performing the division.

$\frac{137}{500} = 0.274$

The decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$ is $0.274$. Now, we need to identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point.

In the decimal $0.274$, the digits to the right of the decimal point are $274$. The last non-zero digit is $4$.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices. We need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to the center than to the vertices.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region within the rectangle where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining a vertex to the center $O$ will divide the rectangle into regions where points are closer to $O$ or to the vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the line segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will intersect at the center $O$ and will form a smaller rectangle whose sides are parallel to the sides of the original rectangle $ABCD$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the line segments joining the center $O$ to the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle.

The area of the smaller rectangle will be $\frac{1}{2}$ the area of the original rectangle $ABCD$. This is because the smaller rectangle is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle, which divides the original rectangle into four congruent smaller rectangles, and the smaller rectangle in question is half of these four smaller rectangles.

Since the point is chosen randomly from the interior of the rectangle $ABCD$, the probability that the point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the length of $AB$ as $kx$ and the length of $AD$ as $x$. The area of the original rectangle $ABCD$ is $kx \cdot x = kx^2$.

The smaller rectangle formed by the perpendicular bisectors will have half the length and half the width of the original rectangle. Therefore, the length of the smaller rectangle is $\frac{kx}{2}$ and the width is $\frac{x}{2}$. The area of the smaller rectangle is $\frac{kx}{2} \cdot \frac{x}{2} = \frac{kx^2}{4}$.

However, we need to consider the correct ratio of the areas. The correct approach is to recognize that the region closer to the center $O$ is the intersection of the four quarter-circles with radius equal to half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. This region is an octagon, but we can simplify the problem by recognizing that the probability is simply the ratio of the area of the smaller square (formed by the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors) to the area of the original rectangle.

The side length of the smaller square is $\frac{\sqrt{k^2+1}}{2}x$, but we can simplify the problem by recognizing that the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$ due to the symmetry and geometric properties of the rectangle.

The problem requires finding the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) is less than 4, we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \) is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) is equal to 4, we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

We need to calculate the distance traveled by Jim, who walks diagonally, and the distance traveled by Martha, who walks along the perimeter (length and width).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the distance traveled by Jim, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Here, the diagonal of the rectangular field is the hypotenuse, and the length and width are the other two sides.

The distance traveled by Jim is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Jim}} = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

The distance traveled by Martha is the sum of the length and width of the field, since she walks along the perimeter:

Next, we need to find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:

[ADVANCE]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}\). They satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We can use this property to simplify the given expression. First, let's find a common denominator for the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]

Since \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{2 - 1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

However, we need to consider the case when \(\omega = 1\), because in that case, the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is not defined. When \(\omega = 1\), the expression becomes \(\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\).

So, we have two possible values for the expression: \(\frac{1}{2}\) when \(\omega \neq 1\), and \(1\) when \(\omega = 1\).

But since the problem asks for the possible values of the expression for \(\omega\) being a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we exclude \(\omega = 1\) and consider only the complex roots of unity.

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
