We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\angle EFD = 90^\circ$, and $\sin D = 0.7$. We need to find the length of $DE$.

Given that $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, and we know $\sin D = 0.7$, we can set up the equation $\frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7$. We also know that $EF = 7$.

[ADVANCE]

We can substitute $EF = 7$ into the equation $\frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7$ to solve for $DF$. This gives us $\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7$. Solving for $DF$, we get $DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10$.

Now that we have the length of $DF$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that $DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2$. Substituting the known values, we get $DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2$. Simplifying, we have $DE^2 + 49 = 100$. Solving for $DE^2$, we get $DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $DE = \sqrt{51}$.

[OUTPUT]

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

# To find the result of the rotation, we need to calculate $w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$.
# First, we calculate $z - c$:

# Next, we need to multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$, which is equal to $\cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.
# So, we have:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = (\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) + (-3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \]

The problem requires simplifying the expression $\sqrt{242}$. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root by extracting perfect squares.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root by extracting the perfect square:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The problem requires finding the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table, with the condition that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together. We treated the 3 people as a single unit, reducing the problem to arranging 6 units around a round table, which can be done in $5!$ ways. Within the 3-person unit, the individuals can be arranged in $3!$ ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is $5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720$.

The problem asks for the term constant in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\).

The general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\).

[ADVANCE]

To find the constant term, we need to determine the value of \(k\) for which the exponent of \(x\) in the term is zero. The exponent of \(x\) in the general term is given by \(3(5-k) - 2k = 15 - 5k\). Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3.\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term:
\[\binom{5}{3}(10x^3)^{5-3}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3}(10x^3)^2\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3.\]

Simplifying this expression, we get:
\[\binom{5}{3}(10)^2(x^3)^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3(x^2)^{-3} = \binom{5}{3}(100)x^6\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)x^{-6} = \binom{5}{3}(100)\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -125.\]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

We can rewrite the expression in terms of $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},

\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

We need to find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

The problem involves finding the minimum number of degrees required to rotate a regular pentagon around its center until it coincides with its initial position.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides, and the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by $(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ$. The measure of each interior angle of a regular pentagon is $\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ$.

However, we are interested in the exterior angle, which is the angle at each vertex when the pentagon is rotated. The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is $360^\circ$, so for a regular pentagon, each exterior angle is $\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ$.

This means that the pentagon must be rotated by a multiple of $72^\circ$ to coincide with its initial position. The minimum number of degrees required to rotate the pentagon until it coincides with its initial position is therefore $72^\circ$.

The problem involves finding the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram, given the coordinates of the other three vertices. We can use the property of parallelograms that the diagonals bisect each other to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

The given coordinates are $(5, 3)$, $(6, 8)$, and $(7, 4)$, and we need to find the coordinates $(x, y)$ such that $x > 7$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$ is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$.

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(6, 8)$ and $(7, 4)$ is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting $(5, 3)$ and $(x, y)$. So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

From this, we can equate the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving these equations, we get:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are $(8, 9)$. Since $x > 7$, this solution satisfies the condition.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the coordinates of the fourth vertex as $(8, 9)$, we can find the value of $x + y$:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

Therefore, the value of $x + y$ is $\boxed{17}$.

\[

The problem involves finding the asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \). We need to determine the vertical asymptotes \( x = a \) and \( x = b \), and the horizontal asymptote \( y = c \), and then find the sum \( a + b + c \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), where \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can find the sum \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express this equation as $z^5 - 1 = 0$. Factoring the left-hand side, we get $(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0$. Given that $z \neq 1$, it follows that $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the equation $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ as $z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1$. Dividing the entire equation by $z^2$ (since $z \neq 0$), we obtain $z^2 + z + 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^2} = 0$. Rearranging the terms, we have $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + z + \frac{1}{z} = -1$.

[ADVANCE]

Let $x = z + \frac{1}{z}$. Then, we can express $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$ in terms of $x$ as follows: $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)^2 - 2 = x^2 - 2$. Substituting these expressions into the equation $z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + z + \frac{1}{z} = -1$, we get $x^2 - 2 + x = -1$. Simplifying this equation, we obtain $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$.

[ADVANCE]

We can solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = -1$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Since $x = z + \frac{1}{z}$, we have $z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = x^2 - 2 + x = -1$. Therefore, the value of $z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$ is already given by the equation we derived, and we don't need to substitute the values of $x$ back into this expression. The value of $z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$ is simply $-1$.

Perform the subtraction in base 10:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

Now, we need to convert $36_{10}$ back to base 9.

To convert $36_{10}$ to base 9, we divide 36 by 9 and keep track of the quotient and the remainder:

[ADVANCE]

We start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\), since \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). The expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

Next, we need to find a common denominator to combine the two fractions:
\[

\]

We can use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) to simplify the numerator:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

$-2n = 1$
$n = -\frac{1}{2}$

Since the number of treeks must be a positive value, we need to reconsider the context of the problem. The negative value indicates that the problem might be interpreted in a different way or that the equations might need to be re-evaluated in the context of the problem.

However, given the equations and the standard interpretation of such problems, we can conclude that the number of treeks is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ in the context of the given equations. But since the number of treeks should be a whole number in a practical sense, we might need to re-evaluate the problem statement for any potential misinterpretation.

The problem involves solving a system of linear equations to find the number of treeks that have the same weight as a squig. After translating the problem into equations and solving the system, we found that the number of treeks is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$. However, in a practical sense, the number of treeks should be a whole number, so it's essential to ensure the problem's interpretation is correct.

The problem involves finding the values of $a$ and $b$ by comparing the product of two quadratic expressions with a given quartic polynomial.

The product of the two quadratic expressions $3t^2+5t+a$ and $4t^2+bt-2$ is given by:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + (3b+20)t^3 + (4a+5b-6)t^2 + (5a-10)t - 2a

We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can form a system of equations to solve for $a$ and $b$.

The problem involves a cylindrical reservoir with circular bases being filled with water at a rate of $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The level of the water is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius of the reservoir.

The key elements are:
- The rate at which the reservoir is being filled: $20\pi$ cubic meters per hour.
- The rate at which the water level is rising: 4 meters per hour.
- The formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.

We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The rate of change of the volume of the water in the reservoir is given by $\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi$ cubic meters per hour. The rate of change of the height of the water is given by $\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$ meters per hour. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

Taking the derivative with respect to time $t$, we get:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values, we have:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation to solve for $r^2$:

\[ 20\pi = 4\pi r^2 \]

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a,
\end{cases}
\]
where \( a \) is a constant. We need to find the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the function for both \( x \geq a \) and \( x < a \).

[ADVANCE]

For \( x \geq a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax^2 \), which is a quadratic function opening upwards. The minimum value of this quadratic function occurs at \( x = a \), and the value is \( f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3 \).

For \( x < a \), the function is \( f(x) = ax + 2a \), which is a linear function. The value of this linear function at \( x = a \) is \( f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a \).

Since the function \( f(x) \) must intersect every horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of the quadratic part \( f(x) = ax^2 \) for \( x \geq a \) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of the linear part \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) for \( x < a \) at \( x = a \). This ensures that there are no gaps in the range of \( f(x) \).

We need to find the value of \( a \) such that the minimum value of the quadratic part is less than or equal to the value of the linear part at \( x = a \):
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the inequality as:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \( a \), we get:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we have:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]

We need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true. The roots of the equation \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0 \) are \( a = 0 \), \( a = 2 \), and \( a = -1 \). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 0) \), \( (0, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \).

We can test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:
- For \( a < -1 \), say \( a = -2 \), we have \( (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 < 0 \), so the inequality is satisfied.
- For \( -1 < a < 0 \), say \( a = -0.5 \), we have \( (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 > 0 \), so the inequality is not satisfied.
- For \( 0 < a < 2 \), say \( a = 1 \), we have \( (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 < 0 \), so the inequality is satisfied.
- For \( a > 2 \), say \( a = 3 \), we have \( (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0 \), so the inequality is not satisfied.

Since \( a \) must be positive (the function \( f(x) = ax^2 \) and \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) should be defined and intersecting the horizontal lines), we consider the interval \( 0 < a \leq 2 \).

The largest value of \( a \) that satisfies the inequality is \( a = 2 \).

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) for which the circle with the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1.

To solve this, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). We will complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

[ADVANCE]

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Substituting these back into the original equation, we get:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation is now in standard form, where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\).

Since the radius is given as 1, we can set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1^2 \]
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the values of \(\lambda\), we need to compute \(f(f(x))\) and set it equal to \(x\). First, let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]
We want \(f(f(x)) = x\), so we set the expression equal to \(x\):
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This equation must have a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To simplify the equation, let's denote \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then the equation becomes:
\[ f(y) = x \implies \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]
Substituting back \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we get:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]
This is a complex equation, so let's consider the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). These points satisfy:
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x \implies x(\lambda(1 - x) - 1) = 0. \]
So, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\). We are looking for \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), so we exclude these fixed points.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, let's consider the case when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 1\). For these values, \(f(x) = 0\) or \(f(x) = 0\), respectively, and \(f(f(x)) = 0\), which satisfies the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we need \(f(x) \neq x\), so we exclude \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the equation \(\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x\) has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). We can try to find the values of \(\lambda\) by considering the boundary cases or by solving the equation directly.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's consider the case when \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). Then \(f(x) = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}\). We want \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[ f\left(\frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \lambda \cdot \frac{\lambda}{4} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}. \]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \frac{\lambda^2}{4} - \frac{\lambda^3}{16} = \frac{1}{2} \implies 4\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 = 8. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0. \]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

By inspection, we can see that \(\lambda = 2\) is a root of the equation:
\[ 2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0. \]
So, \(\lambda = 2\) is a solution. We can factor out \(\lambda - 2\) from the cubic equation:
\[ \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = (\lambda - 2)(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4) = 0. \]
The quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4 = 0\) can be solved using the quadratic formula:
\[ \lambda = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}. \]
Since \(0 \leq \lambda \leq 4\), the only valid solution from the quadratic equation is \(\lambda = 1 + \sqrt{5}\), but we need to check if it satisfies the original equation and the condition \(f(x) \neq x\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We have found that \(\lambda = 2\) is a solution. We need to verify that for \(\lambda = 2\), there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

For \(\lambda = 2\), the function becomes \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x)\). We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

We start by simplifying the given expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identity, we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{85^\circ - 25^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator. We can rewrite it using the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the difference-to-product identity, we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
We need to find the smallest positive angle $\theta$ for which $\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}$. The reference angle for $\tan \theta = \sqrt{3}$ is $60^\circ$, and since the tangent is negative, the angle $\theta$ must be in the second or fourth quadrant. The smallest positive angle in the second quadrant is $180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ$.

The objective is to find the number of distinct permutations of these letters.

where \(n\) is the total number of letters, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the repeated letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"", we have:
- Total number of letters, \(n = 7\)
- Frequency of E's, \(n_1 = 2\)
- Frequency of L's, \(n_2 = 2\)
- The remaining letters (I, P, S) each appear once, so their frequencies are not needed in the denominator.

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \cos \phi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \phi \), where \( \phi \) is the golden ratio. We can use the recurrence relation for powers of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \):

We can start by calculating the first few terms:
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2. \]
Since \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( \phi^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Therefore,
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \phi - 1. \]

Next, we can calculate \( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \):
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = \phi \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) - \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) = \phi (\phi - 1) - \phi = \phi^2 - \phi - \phi = \phi^2 - 2\phi. \]
Substituting \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \), we get:
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = \phi + 1 - 2\phi = 1 - \phi. \]

We can continue this process to find a pattern. However, it's more efficient to recognize that the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) is periodic with a period of 6 for the golden ratio. We can verify this by calculating a few more terms.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that the sequence is periodic with a period of 6. We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( 85 \mod 6 = 1 \), we have:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is the same as \( z + \frac{1}{z} \), which is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

The final answer is:

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. The centroid also divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area.

The area of each of these six smaller triangles is $\frac{1}{6}$ of the area of triangle $ABC$. Since the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144, the area of each smaller triangle is $\frac{144}{6} = 24$.

Triangle $ENG$ is one of these smaller triangles, so its area is also 24.

First, we will find the prime factorization of 100 and 150:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

Next, we will determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 by taking the lowest power of each prime factor that appears in both factorizations:

To determine this, we need to find the values of \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( 2^{24} = k^n \), and since \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, \( k \) must also be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Then we have:

To have an even sum, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the remaining five numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, and 13) are odd.

- For (4,2): The first number must be between 1 and 3 (inclusive) to land on column 2, and the second number must be between 1 and 4 (inclusive) to land on row 4. However, since the first number is divided by 4, the remainder can only be 1, 2, or 3, which means the actual row number would be 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4, but here it is 4 which is not valid. So we need to re-evaluate the (4,2) position. The correct row for the second number 4 divided by 5 is 4, but we are only considering up to row 3, so we need to reconsider the problem.

We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. So, $(\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x$ to further simplify the expression. Let's apply this identity to the terms $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
So, $(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}$.

Now, we can substitute this back into our expression:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$, we can express $g(x)$ as $g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015$.

The sum of the roots of a polynomial can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the sum of the roots is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$.

Since $g(x)$ is a cubic function, we can find the sum of its roots by determining the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in $g(x)$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of $g(x) = f(x + 5)$ is the same as the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ shifted by $-5$. This is because if $r$ is a root of $f(x)$, then $r-5$ is a root of $g(x)$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ is given by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $-(-49) = 49$.

Since the roots of $g(x)$ are shifted by $-5$, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 5 = 44$.

The problem requires us to calculate the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\), we can further rewrite the expression as:
\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to proceed.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cot^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 (90^\circ - 40^\circ) = \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]
We need to find the sum of the squares of the tangents of these angles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of squares of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. For angles \(10^\circ\), \(50^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), which are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of \(40^\circ\), we can use the known result:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

The problem involves finding the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$.

We know that the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is given by the formula $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$.

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$ and the unknown interior angle as $x$. The sum of all interior angles except the unknown one is $1070^{\circ}$, so the sum of all interior angles is $1070^{\circ} + x$.

Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we have:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x
\]
Since $x$ is an interior angle of a convex polygon, we know that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can express $x$ as:
\[
x = (n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ}
\]
Given that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$, we can set up the following inequality:
\[
0 < (n-2) \cdot 180 - 1070 < 180
\]
We can split this inequality into two parts:
\[
0 < (n-2) \cdot 180 - 1070 \quad \text{and} \quad (n-2) \cdot 180 - 1070 < 180
\]
Solving the first part:
\[
0 < (n-2) \cdot 180 - 1070 \implies 1070 < (n-2) \cdot 180 \implies \frac{1070}{180} < n-2 \implies 5.94 < n-2 \implies 7.94 < n
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \geq 8$.

Solving the second part:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180 - 1070 < 180 \implies (n-2) \cdot 180 < 1250 \implies n-2 < \frac{1250}{180} \implies n-2 < 6.94 \implies n < 8.94
\]
Since $n$ must be an integer, we have $n \leq 8$.

Combining both parts of the inequality, we get:
\[
8 \leq n \leq 8

Therefore, the only possible value for $n$ is 8.

The problem requires finding an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( (t + 2)t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

We can rewrite the congruence as:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
This can be rearranged into a standard quadratic form:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \).

We find that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( 18^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Substituting \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) into the quadratic formula, we get:

So the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. Since we are asked to find an odd integer, the solution is \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is \(\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) and the range of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is \((0, \pi)\), we can simplify the expression using the identity \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\).

Therefore, \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\).

Now, we can substitute this into the original equation:
\[

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), the equation simplifies to:

However, we need to consider the case when \(x = 0\). But \(\tan^{-1}(0) = 0\) and \(\cot^{-1}(\infty) = \frac{\pi}{2}\), so the expression \(\tan^{-1}(0) + \cot^{-1}(\infty) = \frac{\pi}{2}\), and \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1 \neq \frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, \(x = 0\) is not a solution.

The second line is defined by the point $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$ and the direction vector $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$. Since the lines are parallel, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines, which involves the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point on each line.

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we need to follow these steps:

Next, we compute the cross product of the direction vector $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ and the vector $\mathbf{PQ} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$:
\[
\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
\[
\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ} = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{d} \times \mathbf{PQ}\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

\[
\|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, the distance between the two parallel lines is given by:

# We can use the distributive property of the cross product to expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$.
# The expansion gives us:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.

We are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$. We also know that the area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is 42. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$ and $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, we can conclude that $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$ have the same height (the perpendicular distance from $C$ to $\overline{AD}$ or from $C$ to $\overline{BC}$). Let's denote the length of $\overline{AD}$ as $a$, the length of $\overline{BC}$ as $b$, and the height of the trapezoid as $h$. The area of the trapezoid $[ABCD]$ is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Since $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, $\triangle ACD$ is a right triangle. Let's denote the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $x$ and the length of $\overline{CD}$ as $y$. The area of $\triangle ACD$ is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times y
\]
Since $\overline{AC}$ bisects $\angle BAD$, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. In this case, it means that $\frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{AC}{CE}$, but since $CE$ is not given, we will focus on the areas.

[ADVANCE]

The area of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]
The area of $\triangle ACD$ can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
Since the height $h$ is the same for both triangles, the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$ is the same as the ratio of their bases:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
We also know that:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42
\]
Let's denote $[\triangle ACD]$ as $x$ and $[\triangle ABC]$ as $y$. Then we have:
\[
x + y = 42
\]
And since $\frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}$, and considering that $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector and also perpendicular to $\overline{CD}$, we can use the fact that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is related to the entire trapezoid area. Given the properties, we can deduce that the ratio of the areas is actually related to the average of the bases, but we need to calculate it properly.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ is the height for both $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle ABC$, and considering the trapezoid's area, we can use the fact that the height $h$ is the same for both triangles and the area of the trapezoid is the average of the bases times the height. We can express the area of the trapezoid as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
And the areas of the triangles as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]
Given that $[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42$, and knowing the properties of the angle bisector and the perpendicular, we can conclude that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is half of the trapezoid's area because the height and the angle bisector properties distribute the area properly.

[ADVANCE]

Given the properties and the fact that the trapezoid's area is 42, and considering the angle bisector and perpendicular properties, we can conclude that the area of $\triangle ACD$ is half of the trapezoid's area. Therefore:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

The problem is to solve the equation $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$ for $x$.

[ADVANCE]
To solve the equation, we can start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:
\[
2\sqrt{2x} = 3\sqrt{3x-1}
\]
Next, we can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(2\sqrt{2x})^2 = (3\sqrt{3x-1})^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9(3x-1)
\]
which further simplifies to:
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Rearranging the terms gives:
\[
9 = 27x - 8x
\]
\[
9 = 19x
\]
Solving for $x$ yields:
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

[VERIFY]
We need to check if the solution $x = \frac{9}{19}$ satisfies the original equation and ensures that the expressions under the square roots are non-negative.
First, we check the expression under the square root in the original equation:
\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} \geq 0
\]
and
\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0
\]
Since both expressions are non-negative, the solution is valid. Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{9}{19}$ back into the original equation to verify:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{19}}}{\frac{\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{9 \cdot 2}}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can substitute the values from the given fractions into the operation definition. Here, $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, $m = 7$, $n = 30$, $p = 10$, and $q = 21$. Plugging these values into the operation definition, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]
We can simplify the expression step by step.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, we multiply the numbers:
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]
Next, we can simplify the fraction $\frac{21}{30}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]
Now, we multiply 70 by $\frac{7}{10}$:
\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right) = \frac{70 \cdot 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

So, the value of $\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21}$ is 49.

The problem involves finding the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, intersect when their endpoints are chosen randomly and independently on a circle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use geometric probability and symmetry arguments. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Fixing Points A and B**: Consider fixing points $A$ and $B$ on the circle. The positions of $C$ and $D$ are then independent and random with respect to $A$ and $B$.

2. **Circumference Division**: When $A$ and $B$ are fixed, the circumference of the circle is divided into two arcs by $A$ and $B$. Let's denote the shorter arc between $A$ and $B$ as arc $AB$.

3. **Intersection Condition**: Segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if points $C$ and $D$ are distributed such that one point lies on one arc and the other point lies on the other arc. In other words, $C$ and $D$ must be on opposite sides of the chord $AB$.

4. **Probability Calculation**: Given the symmetry of the problem, we can consider the probability that $C$ and $D$ are on opposite sides of the chord $AB$. If we place $C$ anywhere on the circle, the probability that $D$ falls on the opposite arc (with respect to $AB$) is the same as the probability that $D$ falls on the same arc as $C$. Since the arcs are symmetric, the probability of $D$ being on the opposite arc is $\frac{1}{2}$.

5. **Final Probability**: The probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is therefore $\frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}$, but we need to consider the fact that the order of $C$ and $D$ doesn't matter, and the correct probability is actually $\frac{1}{3}$ due to the symmetry and equal likelihood of all configurations.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem of finding the probability that two randomly chosen chords, $AB$ and $CD$, intersect when their endpoints are chosen randomly and independently on a circle can be solved using geometric probability and symmetry arguments. By fixing points $A$ and $B$, dividing the circumference into two arcs, and considering the distribution of points $C$ and $D$, we can calculate the probability of intersection.

The final probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are in the range of the arcsine function, which is \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\), the cosine values will be non-negative. Using the Pythagorean identity, we get:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting the values of \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\), we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}

\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta)\):

The problem asks for the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\). This expression is in the form of a difference of squares, which can be factored as \((a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)\).

[ADVANCE]

We can apply the difference of squares formula to the given expression:

Now, we can calculate the values inside the parentheses:
\[513 - 487 = 26,\]

The problem requires solving for the positive value of $x$ such that $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -4092$.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions:

x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62
\]
Since we are asked for the positive value of $x$, we select $x = 66$.

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} - 2 \pi \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

So the expression becomes \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\) to simplify the expression. Let's multiply and divide the expression by \(\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)\) to use the double-angle identity for sine.

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity \(\sin (2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \sin \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity again:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}
\]

Since \(\sin (\pi + x) = -\sin x\) and \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} (-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)) (-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right))}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity again:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{16}

We are given an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with $AB = AC$ and altitude $AM = 11$. There is a point $D$ on $\overline{AM}$ such that $AD = 10$ and $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$. We need to find the perimeter of triangle $ABC$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote $\angle BAC = \theta$, then $\angle BDC = 3\theta$. Since $AM$ is the altitude, $\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ$. We can use the fact that $\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC$ to find a relationship between the angles.

Since $\angle BDC = 3\theta$ and $\angle BDC$ is an exterior angle to $\triangle ABD$, we can write:
\[
\angle BDC = \angle BAD + \angle ABD = \theta + \angle ABD
\]
This implies:
\[
3\theta = \theta + \angle ABD \implies \angle ABD = 2\theta
\]
Similarly, $\angle ACD = 2\theta$.

Now, let's consider the right triangles $\triangle ABM$ and $\triangle ACM$. Since $AB = AC$, we have $BM = CM$. Let $BM = CM = x$. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle ABM$, we get:
\$
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2
\]
So, $AB = \sqrt{121 + x^2}$.

Next, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and the given information. We can use the tangent function in $\triangle BDM$ and $\triangle BCM$ to find the relationship between the angles and the sides.

Since $\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \theta$ and $\angle BCM = \theta$, we can write:
\$
\tan \theta = \frac{x}{1} = x \quad \text{and} \quad \tan (90^\circ - \theta) = \cot \theta = \frac{x}{10}
\]
From the cotangent identity, we have:
\$
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x}{10} \implies x^2 = 10
\]
So, $x = \sqrt{10}$.

Now, we can find the length of $AB$:
\$
AB = \sqrt{121 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + 10} = \sqrt{131}
\]
Since $AB = AC$, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\$
AB + AC + BC = \sqrt{131} + \sqrt{131} + 2\sqrt{10} = 2\sqrt{131} + 2\sqrt{10}

The problem requires finding the values of $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds true. We need to solve this compound inequality step by step.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$.

We can factorize the quadratic expression: $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where this inequality is satisfied. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$, we know that $y \geq 0$. Therefore, we only consider the interval where $y$ is non-negative. The inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ is satisfied when $-7 < y < 3$. Since $y = x^2 \geq 0$, we have $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which gives us $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, we consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factorized as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ and it is equal to 0 only when $x^2 = -2$ (which is not possible for real $x$), the inequality $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ is satisfied for all real $x$.

[SYNTHESIZE]

Combining the results from both inequalities, we find that the solution to the compound inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ is the interval where $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, since the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$ is satisfied for all real $x$.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

\end{align*}
We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4$, we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z$, $p = xy + yz + zx$, and $q = xyz = 4$. Then, we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)$, we get
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relationship between $s$ and $p$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We are given the equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be factored as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = 12,\]
where $s = x + y + z$. Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $p = xy + yz + zx$ and $q = xyz = 4$, we have:
\[sp - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
so
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\]
and
\[sp = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
This simplifies to:
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
so
\[s^3 = 64,\]
and
\[s = 4.\]
Now, substituting $s = 4$ back into the equation $sp = 24$, we get:
\[4p = 24,\]
so
\[p = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $p = 6$.

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator can be written as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\), and the denominator can be factored as \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\).

The inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator and when the numerator is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). However, these values make the fraction undefined because the denominator is zero at these points. So, we must exclude \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) from the solution set.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These values also make the fraction undefined. So, we must exclude \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) from the solution set.

Now, we need to determine the sign of the fraction in the intervals defined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

[ADVANCE]

We can test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the fraction.

- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
  \[
  \frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{(-10)(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
  \]
- For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
  \[
  \frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{(-1)(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
  \]
- For \(x \in (0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
  \[
  \frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{(1)(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
  \]
- For \(x \in (9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 10\):
  \[
  \frac{|(10-9)(10+9)|}{(10)(10-36)} = \frac{|(1)(19)|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
  \]
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
  \[
  \frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{(40)(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{(40)(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0.
  \]

From the tests, we see that the fraction is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

Since the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), we do not include the endpoints of the intervals. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the fraction is negative.

# The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2l + 2\pi r = 400 \]
# We can solve this equation for $l$:
\[ l = 200 - \pi r \]
# The area $A$ of the rectangular field is given by:
\[ A = l \times 2r = (200 - \pi r) \times 2r = 400r - 2\pi r^2 \]
# To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $r$ and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dr} = 400 - 4\pi r = 0 \]

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this side as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, $\sin T = \frac{\text{opposite side to } T}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{s}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

Therefore, the value of $\sin T$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}$.

The problem asks for the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. The distance between the origin and a point $(x, y)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We need to express this distance in terms of $x$ and then find the minimum value.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The distance $D$ between the origin and a point $(x, y)$ on the graph is given by:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2-3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2-3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's denote this expression as $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
This gives us the critical points $x = 0$ and $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$. We need to evaluate $f(x)$ at these points to find the minimum value.
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, which occurs at $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the minimum distance is:
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The minimum distance is expressed as $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Thus, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. Therefore, the value of $a+b$ is $\boxed{12}$.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) and asked to find the value of \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \). To do this, we need to find the inverse functions for the respective pieces of \( f(x) \) and then evaluate them at 0 and 6.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3-x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3+2x^2+3x & \text{if } x>3.

\right. \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find \( f^{-1}(0) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \) for \( x \). We will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 0 \), which gives \( x = 3 \). Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \). Factoring out \( x \), we get \( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \). This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \). This gives us \( x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2} \). So, \( x = \frac{-2 + 4}{-2} = -1 \) or \( x = \frac{-2 - 4}{-2} = 3 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid.

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, to find \( f^{-1}(6) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \) for \( x \). Again, we will consider both cases of the piecewise function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 6 \), which gives \( x = -3 \). Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \), which gives \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \). We can try to find the roots of this polynomial equation. By inspection, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not a root (since \( 2 \) is not greater than 3), but we can try \( x = 3 \) as a boundary value. Substituting \( x = 3 \) into the equation, we get \( -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = -6 \neq 0 \), so \( x = 3 \) is not a root. We can use numerical methods or further factorization to find the roots, but for simplicity, we can check if there are any integer solutions greater than 3. By trying \( x = 4 \), we get \( -64 + 32 + 12 - 6 = -26 \neq 0 \). We can continue checking, but it's more efficient to solve it systematically. However, we already have a valid solution \( x = -3 \) from the first case, and we can conclude that we don't need to solve the cubic equation further for this problem.

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Next, we can calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \).

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to the other five vertices. We need to use the properties of a regular octahedron and the given distances to find the unknown distance.

A regular octahedron has two sets of four coplanar points, and the distance between opposite vertices is the same. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as $A, B, C, D, E, F$ and the point as $P$. We are given the distances $PA = 3$, $PB = 7$, $PC = 8$, $PD = 9$, and $PE = 11$. We need to find the distance $PF$.

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. This is a known property of regular octahedra. Therefore, we can write:

\[PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = \text{constant}\]

Since the octahedron is regular, the constant is the same for any point $P$. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices is the same for all vertices. Let's calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:

\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant, we can set up the equation:

\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + PF^2 = 324 + PF^2\]

However, we need to find the correct constant value. The correct approach is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to six times the square of the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron. But we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the vertices to the center is the same for all vertices.

Let's assume the side length of the octahedron is $s$. The distance from the center of the octahedron to any vertex is $\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is $6 \left(\frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = 3s^2$.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant, we can use the given distances to find the constant value.

\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + PF^2 = 2 \times 324 - PF^2\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[324 + PF^2 = 648 - PF^2\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[2PF^2 = 324\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[PF^2 = 162\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[PF = \sqrt{162} = \sqrt{81 \times 2} = 9\sqrt{2}\]

Therefore, the distance from $P$ to the sixth vertex is $\boxed{9\sqrt{2}}$.

The problem involves comparing the accelerations of two objects (a softball and a baseball) given that the force applied to each object is the same. We need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (F) is equal to mass (m) times acceleration (a), or F = ma.

Given:
- Mass of the softball (m1) = 200 g = 0.2 kg
- Mass of the baseball (m2) = 150 g = 0.15 kg
- The force applied to each object is the same.

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball.

Since the force applied to each object is the same, we can set up the equation:
F = m1 * a1 = m2 * a2
where a1 is the acceleration of the softball and a2 is the acceleration of the baseball.

We can rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio of the accelerations:
a1 / a2 = m2 / m1

Substituting the given masses:
a1 / a2 = 0.15 kg / 0.2 kg
a1 / a2 = 15/20
a1 / a2 = 3/4

So, the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball is 3/4.

The given polynomial equation is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). We can use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of its roots. For a polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), Vieta's formulas tell us that:

- The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is \(a_2\).
- The sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time is \(-a_1\).
- The product of the roots is \(a_0\).

- The product of the roots \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\).

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\).

Since \(p + q + r = 0\), we can express \(r\) as \(-p - q\). Substituting \(r = -p - q\) into the product equation, we get:

\[pqr = pq(-p - q) = -pq(p + q) = -4.\]

This implies that \(pq(p + q) = 4\).

We also know that \(p + q + r = 0\), so \(r = -p - q\). We can now consider the possible values of \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\) that satisfy these equations.

Since the expressions are symmetric and the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots must either be real or come in conjugate pairs. Given the complexity of the polynomial, it's likely that the roots are complex and come in conjugate pairs.

Let's assume the roots are \(\alpha, \overline{\alpha}, \beta, \overline{\beta}\). Then, the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) will be real.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the product of the roots taken two at a time is 0, we can deduce that the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) must be \(\{-2, 1, 1\}\).

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. We need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to $O$ than to any vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region within the rectangle where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any vertex, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $O$ to a vertex will divide the plane into two regions: one where points are closer to $O$ and the other where points are closer to the vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will form a smaller rectangle whose center is also $O$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the segments joining $O$ to the midpoints of the sides of the original rectangle.

Let's denote the coordinates of $A$ as $(-a, b)$, $B$ as $(a, b)$, $C$ as $(a, -b)$, and $D$ as $(-a, -b)$. The center $O$ is at $(0, 0)$. The distance from $O$ to any vertex is $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. The region closer to $O$ than to any vertex will be a square with side length equal to the distance from $O$ to the midpoint of any side of the rectangle, which is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}$.

The area of the smaller square is $\left(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}$. The area of the original rectangle is $4ab$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Given that $\frac{AB}{AD} = k$, we can express the side lengths of the rectangle in terms of $k$. Let $AD = x$, then $AB = kx$. The area of the rectangle is $AB \cdot AD = kx \cdot x = kx^2$.

The area of the smaller square is $\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} = \frac{\left(\frac{kx}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2}{2} = \frac{\frac{k^2x^2}{4} + \frac{x^2}{4}}{2} = \frac{k^2x^2 + x^2}{8} = \frac{x^2(k^2 + 1)}{8}$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle:

\[

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) for three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise, using the floor function for \( n \geq 4 \) and the ceiling function for \( n < 4 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

First, we need to evaluate each of the given values:
1. \( \frac{\pi}{3} \): Since \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \), which is less than 4. Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).
2. \( \sqrt{45} \): Since \( \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708 \), which is greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).
3. \( 8^{2/3} \): Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), which is equal to 4. Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The problem involves calculating the total amount of money earned by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie from selling research posters, and then converting the total amount into dollars to find out how much money remains after the conversion.

The amounts earned by each person are:
- Linda: \$27.47
- Sherry: \$35.23
- June: \$37.37
- Connie: \$26.52

The objective is to find the total amount of money earned, convert it into dollars, and determine the remaining amount in cents after the conversion.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by summing up the individual amounts:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's perform the addition step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

The total amount of money earned is \$126.59.

Next, we need to convert this total amount into dollars and cents. Since the amount is already in dollars and cents, we can directly find the remaining amount in cents after the conversion. The dollar part is 126 dollars, and the cent part is 59 cents.

The remaining amount in cents is the cent part of the total amount, which is 59 cents.

The problem requires us to find the remaining amount in cents after converting the total amount of money earned by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie into dollars. We calculated the total amount earned as \$126.59 and then found the remaining amount in cents, which is the cent part of the total amount.

We are given that $\omega^3 = 1$, where $\omega$ is a complex number. We need to find all possible values of the expression $\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}$. These roots satisfy the equation $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$.

We can use this property to simplify the given expression. Let's rewrite the expression:

\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.\]

Since $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$, we have $\omega^2 = -1 - \omega$ and $\omega = -1 - \omega^2$. We can substitute these into the expression.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting $\omega^2 = -1 - \omega$ into the second term, we get:

\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator:

\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.\]

We can simplify this further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\omega^2$ (since $\omega^3 = 1$):

\[-\frac{1}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{\omega^2}{\omega^3(1 + \omega)} = -\frac{\omega^2}{1 + \omega}.\]

Now, we can use the fact that $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$ to express $\omega^2$ as $-1 - \omega$:

\[-\frac{\omega^2}{1 + \omega} = -\frac{-1 - \omega}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega} = 1.\]

However, we also need to consider the case when $\omega = 1$, because we divided by $\omega$ earlier. If $\omega = 1$, the expression becomes:

\[\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.\]

So, in both cases, the value of the expression is the same.

The problem asks for the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the minimum total distance that visits all four points.

Let's assume the coordinates of the points are given. For simplicity, let's assume the points are located at the following coordinates:
- $A = (0, 0)$
- $B = (3, 0)$
- $C = (3, 4)$
- $D = (0, 4)$

These points form a rectangle.

[ADVANCE]

To find the shortest distance, we can calculate the total distance for each possible route and then compare them. Since there are 4 points, there are $3! = 6$ possible routes to consider, starting from any given point.

Let's calculate the distances between each pair of points:
- $AB = \sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = 3$
- $AC = \sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (4-0)^2} = 5$
- $AD = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (4-0)^2} = 4$
- $BC = \sqrt{(3-3)^2 + (4-0)^2} = 4$
- $BD = \sqrt{(0-3)^2 + (4-0)^2} = 5$
- $CD = \sqrt{(0-3)^2 + (4-4)^2} = 3$

Now, let's consider the possible routes starting from point $A$:
1. $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$: $AB + BC + CD + DA = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14$
2. $A \to B \to D \to C \to A$: $AB + BD + DC + CA = 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 16$
3. $A \to C \to B \to D \to A$: $AC + CB + BD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 18$
4. $A \to C \to D \to B \to A$: $AC + CD + DB + BA = 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 16$
5. $A \to D \to B \to C \to A$: $AD + DB + BC + CA = 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 18$
6. $A \to D \to C \to B \to A$: $AD + DC + CB + BA = 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 14$

The shortest distance among these routes is 14.

Since the problem is symmetric and the distances are the same for starting points $B$, $C$, or $D$, the shortest distance will be the same.

Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once is $\boxed{14}$.
