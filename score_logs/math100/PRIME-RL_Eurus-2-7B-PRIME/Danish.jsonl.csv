We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\sin D = 0.7$ and the length of the side opposite to angle $D$ (which is $EF$) is 7. We need to find the length of the hypotenuse $DE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}$, we can substitute the given values into the equation: $0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}$. To find $DE$, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $DE$: $DE = \frac{7}{0.7}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the value of $DE$: $DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10$.

We are given a complex number $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and another complex number $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.

To solve this, we can use the formula for rotating a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta}. \]
Here, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, so $e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to calculate $z - c$:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i. \]
Now, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} = (1 - 3i)(1+i) = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 - 2i + 3 = 4 - 2i. \]
Finally, we add $c$ to this result to get $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i. \]

The problem asks us to simplify $\sqrt{242}$. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To simplify $\sqrt{242}$, we first find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root expression:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

Next action: [OUTPUT]

# The problem involves arranging 8 people around a round table, with the constraint that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together.
# We need to consider the arrangement of the 3 people who must sit together as a single block, reducing the number of ""units"" to arrange around the table from 8 to 6 (the 3-person block plus the remaining 5 individuals).
# Since the table is round, we need to account for the fact that rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

# We can treat the 3-person block (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) as a single unit, so we have 6 units to arrange around the round table.
# The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$, so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units around the table is $(6-1)! = 5!$.
# Within the 3-person block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in $3!$ different ways.
# Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the units around the table and the number of ways to arrange the people within the block: $5! \times 3!$.

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
The general term in the expansion of \((a + b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\).

Simplifying the general term, we get:
\[
\binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]
To find the constant term, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero, so we set \(15 - 5k = 0\) and solve for \(k\):
\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term to find the constant term:
\[
\binom{5}{3} (10)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

Substituting $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we get:
\[ n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Now, we can calculate the product:
\[ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 24 \pmod{7} \]

We need to find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[ 24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ with a remainder of } 3 \]
So, $24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
[ADVANCE]
In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex (x, y).

Let's calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This midpoint should be equal to the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and (x, y):
\[
\left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]
By equating the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
6 = \frac{6+x}{2} \implies 12 = 6 + x \implies x = 6
\]
However, we are given that x > 7, so this value of x is not valid. Let's consider the other possible pair of diagonals, formed by vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8), and (7, 4) and (x, y).

The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (6, 8) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]
This midpoint should be equal to the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (7, 4) and (x, y):
\[
\left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]
By equating the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{11}{2} = \frac{7+x}{2} \implies 11 = 7 + x \implies x = 4
\]
This value of x is also not valid since x > 7. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's consider the vector approach. The midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (5, 3) and (7, 4) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal formed by vertices (6, 8) and (x, y). The vector from (5, 3) to (7, 4) is (2, 1). This vector should be the same as the vector from (6, 8) to (x, y). So, we can write:
\[
(x, y) - (6, 8) = (2, 1) \implies (x, y) = (6+2, 8+1) = (8, 9)
\]
Here, x = 8, which is greater than 7, so this value is valid. Now, we can find x + y:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the rational function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \) and then calculating the sum of the values of these asymptotes.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as the function is undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting the factored form equal to zero gives us the vertical asymptotes:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
So, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), which means \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), where \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. In this case, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate the sum of the values of the asymptotes:
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

\[99^2 = (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.\]

Next, we add $99$ to the result:
\[99^2 + 99 = 9801 + 99 = 9900.\]

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901.\]

We can rewrite the expression using the identity \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

Using the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\), we can simplify the expression further:

We can use the second equation to express $S$ in terms of $T$ and $G$:
$S = 2T + G$

Now, substitute this expression for $S$ into the first equation:
$3T = (2T + G) + G$
$3T = 2T + 2G$
$T = 2G$

Now that we have the relationship between $T$ and $G$, we can substitute $G = \frac{T}{2}$ back into the equation $S = 2T + G$ to find the relationship between $S$ and $T$:
$S = 2T + \frac{T}{2}$
$S = \frac{4T}{2} + \frac{T}{2}$
$S = \frac{5T}{2}$

This equation tells us that the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of $\frac{5}{2}$ treeks. To find the number of treeks that have the same weight as one squig, we can simply take the coefficient of $T$ in the equation $S = \frac{5T}{2}$, which is $\frac{5}{2}$.

Since we are asked for the number of treeks, the answer is $\frac{5}{2}$ treeks per squig, but we need to present it in the required format.

The product of the two polynomials is:

Combining like terms, we get:
\[

We can now compare the coefficients of the corresponding terms with the given polynomial $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$.

The problem involves finding the radius of a cylindrical tank that is being filled with water at a certain rate. We are given the rate at which the volume of water increases and the rate at which the water level rises. We need to use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to relate these rates and solve for the radius.

[ADVANCE]

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. The rate at which the volume of water increases is \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. The rate at which the water level rises is \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour.

We can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \( t \) to relate the rates:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]
Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]
We can simplify this equation to solve for \( r \):
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2
\]
Dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \), we get:
\[
5 = r^2
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}

To solve this, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). We will complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

[ADVANCE]

1. Complete the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

2. Complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

3. Substitute the completed square terms back into the original equation:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

The equation is now in the standard form of a circle, \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\).

Since the radius is given as 1, we can set up the equation:

The problem requires finding the smallest positive angle $\theta$ for which the given expression for $\tan \theta$ holds. The expression involves trigonometric functions of various angles, and we need to simplify it to identify the angle $\theta$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We start by simplifying the given expression for $\tan \theta$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identity for cosine, we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{85^\circ - 25^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator. We can rewrite it using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the difference-to-product identity for sine, we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the expression for $\tan \theta$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
We need to find the smallest positive angle $\theta$ for which $\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}$. The angle whose tangent is $-\sqrt{3}$ is $120^\circ$ or $300^\circ$, but we are looking for the smallest positive angle, which is $120^\circ$.

where \(n\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let's set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

So, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \). We can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

We are given a complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote \( z + \frac{1}{z} = a \), where \( a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We recognize that \( a \) is the golden ratio, which satisfies the equation \( a^2 = a + 1 \).

We can use the recurrence relation for the powers of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \):
\[ z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right) = a \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) - \left( z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} \right). \]

Starting with \( n = 2 \):
\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = a^2 - 2 = a + 1 - 2 = a - 1. \]

For \( n = 3 \):
\[ z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = a \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) - \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) = a (a - 1) - a = a^2 - 2a = (a + 1) - 2a = 1 - a. \]

For \( n = 4 \):
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = a \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) - \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right) = a (1 - a) - (a - 1) = a - a^2 - a + 1 = 1 - a^2 = 1 - (a + 1) = -a. \]

For \( n = 5 \):
\[ z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = a \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) - \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) = a (-a) - (1 - a) = -a^2 - 1 + a = -(a + 1) - 1 + a = -2 - a + a = -2. \]

For \( n = 6 \):
\[ z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = a \left( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \right) - \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right) = a (-2) - (-a) = -2a + a = -a. \]

We observe that \( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = -a \) and \( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = -2 \). This suggests a periodicity in the sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) with a period of 12, since \( z^{12} + \frac{1}{z^{12}} = z^0 + \frac{1}{z^0} = 2 \) and the sequence will repeat.

[ADVANCE]

Since the sequence has a period of 12, we can reduce the exponent 85 modulo 12:
\[ 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}. \]
Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ into a decimal. To do this, we need to simplify the fraction and then perform the division.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the denominator. The denominator is $2^2 \cdot 5^7 = 4 \cdot 78125 = 312500$. So, the fraction becomes $\frac{21}{312500}$.

Next, we can convert this fraction into a decimal by performing the division. To make the division easier, we can express the fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10. We can do this by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $2^5 = 32$, which will give us a denominator of $10^7 = 10000000$.

$\frac{21}{312500} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{312500 \cdot 32} = \frac{672}{10000000} = 0.0000672$.

First, we need to find the prime factorization of 100 and 150:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The GCD of 100 and 150 is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers:
\[ \text{GCD}(100, 150) = 2^1 \times 5^2 = 50 \]

Now, we need to find the number of positive 10-digit factors of 50. However, since 50 is a relatively small number, we can list its factors:
\[ \text{Factors of } 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 \]

We observe that none of these factors are 10-digit numbers. The smallest 10-digit number is 1,000,000,000 and the largest 10-digit number is 9,999,999,999. Since 50 is much smaller than the smallest 10-digit number, there are no 10-digit factors of 50.

The problem asks for the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power. This means that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \). Therefore, we need to find the values of \( n \) for which \( 2^{24} = k^n \) holds true.

[ADVANCE]

For \( 2^{24} \) to be a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \( n \). This is because \( k^n = 2^{24} \) implies that \( k \) must be of the form \( 2^m \) for some integer \( m \), and thus \( (2^m)^n = 2^{mn} = 2^{24} \), which means \( mn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

[ADVANCE]

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since the problem specifies \( n > 1 \), we exclude \( n = 1 \). Therefore, the possible values of \( n \) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

[ADVANCE]

To determine the probability that the sum of the two selected numbers is even, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.

Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is 2, and the remaining five numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, and 13) are odd.

[ADVANCE]

We can calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each select a number from the first six prime numbers. Since each of them has 6 choices, the total number of possible outcomes is $6 \times 6 = 36$.

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the two selected numbers is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.

Since there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, and 13), the number of ways to choose two even numbers is $1 \times 1 = 1$, and the number of ways to choose two odd numbers is $5 \times 5 = 25$.

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is $1 + 25 = 26$.

[ADVANCE]

The probability that the sum of the two selected numbers is even is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability is $\frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}$.

The problem involves a game where two numbers are randomly selected from a hexagonal wheel, and then used to determine the position of a brick on a chessboard. The first number is divided by 4 to determine the column, and the second number is divided by 5 to determine the row. We need to find the probability that the brick is placed on a shaded square of the chessboard.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Understand the Hexagonal Wheel**: The hexagonal wheel has 12 numbers (1 to 12), and each number is equally likely to be selected.
2. **Determine Column and Row**: The first number is divided by 4 to get the column (remainder 1, 2, or 3), and the second number is divided by 5 to get the row (remainder 1, 2, 3, or 4).
3. **Chessboard Layout**: A standard chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns. We need to map the remainders to the chessboard coordinates.
4. **Shaded Squares**: We need to identify the shaded squares on the chessboard. Typically, shaded squares refer to the black squares on a chessboard, which follow a checkerboard pattern.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Map Remainders to Chessboard Coordinates**: The remainders for the column (1, 2, 3) can be mapped to the columns 1, 2, and 3 of the chessboard (since the wheel has 12 numbers, the columns are repeated every 4 numbers). The remainders for the row (1, 2, 3, 4) can be mapped to the rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the chessboard (since the wheel has 12 numbers, the rows are repeated every 5 numbers).
2. **Identify Shaded Squares**: On a standard chessboard, the shaded (black) squares follow a checkerboard pattern. We need to count the number of shaded squares in the 4x3 sub-grid (since we are only considering the first 4 rows and first 3 columns).

[ADVANCE]

1. **Count Shaded Squares**: In a 4x3 sub-grid, we can count the number of shaded squares. The pattern of the chessboard will give us 6 shaded squares (since every other square is shaded).

[ADVANCE]

1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to select two numbers from the hexagonal wheel, which is \(12 \times 12 = 144\).
2. **Favorable Outcomes**: The number of favorable outcomes (placing the brick on a shaded square) is the number of shaded squares in the 4x3 sub-grid, which is 6, multiplied by the probability of getting each specific column and row combination. Since each column and row combination is equally likely, the probability is \(\frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}\) for the column and \(\frac{3}{4}\) for the row, but we need to consider the actual count of shaded squares in the grid.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Calculate Probability**: The probability of placing the brick on a shaded square is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Since there are 6 shaded squares in the 4x3 sub-grid, and each cell in the grid is equally likely, the probability is \(\frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}\) for the column and \(\frac{3}{4}\) for the row, but we need to consider the actual count of shaded squares in the grid. The actual count of shaded squares in the grid is 6 out of 12 possible outcomes for the column and 3 out of 4 possible outcomes for the row. The total number of favorable outcomes is \(6 \times 3 = 18\), and the total number of possible outcomes is \(12 \times 12 = 144\). Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{18}{144} = \frac{1}{8}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\).

The problem requires finding the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}$.

First, we need to simplify the fraction by calculating the denominator:
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000.\]
So, the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}.\]

Next, we can convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division.

[ADVANCE]

Perform the division to convert the fraction to a decimal:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605.\]

The decimal representation of the fraction is $0.00021605$. To find the sum of the digits, we ignore the decimal point and sum the digits:
\[0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14.\]

The problem requires finding the product of sines of several angles. We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to pair up the terms in the product. Notice that $\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ$. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ) = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sin 2x}{\sin x}$ to express the product in terms of $\sin 2x$. However, a more efficient approach is to use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
We can apply this identity to the product by grouping the terms appropriately. Notice that:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 180^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 0 = 0.
\]
However, this approach seems to be leading to a complicated path. Instead, we can use the identity for the product of cosines and sines in terms of the sine of multiple angles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity for the product of sines in terms of the sine of multiple angles. We can also use the fact that the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression can be simplified using the formula:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sin \left( \frac{k \pi}{n} \right) = \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}.
\]
For $n=9$, we have:
\[
\sin \frac{\pi}{9} \sin \frac{2\pi}{9} \sin \frac{3\pi}{9} \sin \frac{4\pi}{9} \sin \frac{5\pi}{9} \sin \frac{6\pi}{9} \sin \frac{7\pi}{9} \sin \frac{8\pi}{9} = \frac{9}{2^8}.
\]
Since $\sin \frac{5\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{140^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 140^\circ$, $\sin \frac{6\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{120^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 120^\circ$, $\sin \frac{7\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{140^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 160^\circ$, and $\sin \frac{8\pi}{9} = \sin \frac{160^\circ}{180^\circ} = \sin 160^\circ$, we can rewrite the product as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{9}{2^8} = \frac{9}{256}.

The problem asks for the geometric shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) and \(\theta\) represent the radial distance and angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, respectively, and \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height above the \(xy\)-plane is constant, regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This means that for any point in the \(xy\)-plane, the \(z\)-coordinate is fixed at \(c\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Given that the \(z\)-coordinate is constant and can take any value for \(r\) and \(\theta\), the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane. This is because the equation does not impose any restrictions on \(r\) and \(\theta\), allowing them to vary freely, which results in a flat surface extending infinitely in the radial and angular directions.

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of the function $g(x)$.

[ADVANCE]

The function $f(x)$ is given by $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$. The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + k$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term and $a$ is the leading coefficient.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, we can substitute $x + 5$ into the function $f(x)$ to get the expression for $g(x)$. However, we don't need to expand the expression for $g(x)$ completely. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is related to the sum of the roots of $f(x)$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x)$ is given by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $-(-49) = 49$. Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the roots of $g(x)$ are shifted by $-5$ compared to the roots of $f(x)$. If the roots of $f(x)$ are $r_1, r_2, r_3$, then the roots of $g(x)$ are $r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5$.

The sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is therefore $(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34$.

We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Let's start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\).

The expression becomes \(\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ\).

We can rewrite the expression using the identities \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\):

\[

\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

We need to find the values of \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) to proceed. We can use the fact that \(\cot x = \tan (90^\circ - x)\) to relate these terms.

Next, we can use the identity \(\tan (3x) = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\) to find a relationship between \(\tan 10^\circ\), \(\tan 20^\circ\), and \(\tan 30^\circ\).

Since \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), we can set up the equation:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}

This equation is complex to solve directly, so let's use another approach to find the value of the expression.

We can use the identity \(\cot 2x = \frac{1 - \tan^2 x}{2\tan x}\) to express \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 10^\circ\).

However, a more efficient approach is to use the known result for this type of trigonometric expression. We can use the identity:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 3x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 16

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$ and the unknown interior angle as $x$. The sum of all interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, so we can write the equation:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} - x = 1070^{\circ}
\]
Since $x$ is an interior angle of a convex polygon, we know that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the sum of the interior angles:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x
\]
Since $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$ must be an integer multiple of $180^{\circ}$, we can find the range of possible values for $n$ by trial and error, ensuring that $1070^{\circ} + x$ is a multiple of $180^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$.

[ADVANCE]

We need to find an integer $n$ such that $(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ}$ is slightly greater than $1070^{\circ}$. Let's try different values of $n$:
\[
(n-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} \approx 1070^{\circ}
\]
For $n = 8$:
\[
(8-2) \cdot 180^{\circ} = 6 \cdot 180^{\circ} = 1080^{\circ}
\]
This is close to $1070^{\circ}$. We can find the value of $x$:
\[
1080^{\circ} - x = 1070^{\circ} \implies x = 10^{\circ}
\]
Since $0^{\circ} < 10^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}$, this value of $x$ is valid.

To solve the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). In modulo 23 arithmetic, this becomes:

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{8} \pmod{23} \). Since \( 8 = 2^3 \), we need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \).

We can test the values to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. By testing, we find that \( 6^2 = 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23} \) and \( 7^2 = 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23} \), but \( 8^2 = 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \) and \( 10^2 = 100 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \), and \( 11^2 = 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23} \), and \( 12^2 = 144 \equiv 11 \pmod{23} \), and \( 13^2 = 169 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), and \( 14^2 = 196 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \), and \( 15^2 = 225 \equiv 21 \pmod{23} \), and \( 16^2 = 256 \equiv 3 \pmod{23} \), and \( 17^2 = 289 \equiv 13 \pmod{23} \), and \( 18^2 = 324 \equiv 6 \pmod{23} \), and \( 19^2 = 361 \equiv 11 \pmod{23} \), and \( 20^2 = 400 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \). So, \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 20 \pmod{23} \) and \( \sqrt{8} \equiv -20 \equiv 3 \pmod{23} \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]
Now we can substitute the values of \( \sqrt{8} \) back into the quadratic formula:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 + 20}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{18}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
and
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 - 20}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-22}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -11 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 12 \pmod{23} \]
We need to check which of these values is an odd integer between 0 and 23.

The value \( t = 9 \) is an odd integer between 0 and 23, and the value \( t = 12 \) is an even integer. Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) that satisfies the condition is \( t = 9 \).

This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term $a_1$ is 1 and the common difference $d$ is 2.

The general formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

We need to find the 2003rd term, so we will substitute $n = 2003$, $a_1 = 1$, and $d = 2$ into the formula.

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + (2003-1) \cdot 2 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + 2002 \cdot 2 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + 4004 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 4005 \]

So, the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers is $\boxed{4005}$.

The problem involves finding the solutions to the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). We need to use trigonometric identities and properties of inverse trigonometric functions to simplify the expression inside the sine function.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). However, since the range of \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is \(\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) and the range of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is \((0, \pi)\), we can simplify the expression using the identity \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\).

Therefore, \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\).

Now, we can substitute this into the original equation:
\[\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), the equation simplifies to:
\[1 = \frac{1}{3}.\]

This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the equation holds for all \(x \neq 0\) is incorrect. However, we need to re-evaluate the problem because the contradiction suggests that there might be no solution or we might have missed something.

Let's re-check the properties and ranges of the inverse trigonometric functions and the sine function.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Given the identity \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x \neq 0\), we can rewrite the original equation as:
\[\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.\]

However, we know that \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\), so the equation \(1 = \frac{1}{3}\) is indeed a contradiction. This implies that there are no values of \(x\) that satisfy the original equation.

Therefore, the solution to the equation is the empty set.

The problem involves finding the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The lines are defined by their direction vectors and points on the lines. The first line is given by \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the second line is given by \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since the lines are parallel, their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so the lines are indeed parallel.

To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines, which involves the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting a point on each line.

Let's denote the point on the first line as \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and the point on the second line as \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector connecting these points is \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

The direction vector of the lines is \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we need to calculate the cross product of \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{d}\).

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix}
= \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2)
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14)
= \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The magnitude of this cross product is:

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

The magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) is:

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

The distance between the two parallel lines is given by:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|}{\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

We can use the distributive property of the cross product to expand the expression $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$:

Since the cross product of a vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, the expression simplifies to:
\[6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.\]

We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so we can substitute $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$:

The number of flags for each country in the 70s is provided in the table.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the average price of Juan's 70s flags, we need to calculate the total cost of the flags and then divide by the total number of flags. The number of flags for each country in the 70s is: Brazil (12), France (12), Peru (6), and Spain (13). The prices for the flags are: Brazil and Peru (6 cents each), and France and Spain (5 cents each).

First, we calculate the total cost of the flags:
- Brazil: $12 \times 6 = 72$ cents
- France: $12 \times 5 = 60$ cents
- Peru: $6 \times 6 = 36$ cents
- Spain: $13 \times 5 = 65$ cents

The total cost is: $72 + 60 + 36 + 65 = 233$ cents.

Next, we calculate the total number of flags:
$12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43$ flags.

Now, we can find the average price by dividing the total cost by the total number of flags:
$\frac{233}{43} \approx 5.4186$ cents.

To solve the equation, we can start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:
\[
2\sqrt{2x} = 3\sqrt{3x-1}

Next, we can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(2\sqrt{2x})^2 = (3\sqrt{3x-1})^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9(3x-1)

Now, we can isolate $x$ by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation:

Dividing both sides by $-19$ gives:

The problem involves selecting four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, and we need to find the probability that the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of circular permutations and the properties of intersecting chords in a circle. When four points are chosen on a circle, the line segments formed by joining these points will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating manner (i.e., the points from one segment are separated by the points of the other segment).

Let's consider the four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ as being placed in a specific order around the circle. We can fix the position of point $A$ and then consider the relative positions of the other three points. The total number of ways to arrange the remaining three points ($B$, $C$, and $D$) relative to $A$ is $3! = 6$.

For the segments $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, the points $C$ and $D$ must be placed on the arc that is opposite to the arc containing $A$ and $B$. This means that $C$ and $D$ must be placed on the arc that does not contain $A$ and $B$. There are exactly 2 ways to arrange $C$ and $D$ on this arc such that the segments intersect (i.e., $C$ and $D$ are separated by $B$).

Therefore, the probability that the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements, which is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.

The problem requires evaluating the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). We need to use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\).

Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), \(\alpha\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), \(\beta\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we use the angle sum and difference identities for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting the values of \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\), we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\alpha - \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2\sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{21})^2}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -\frac{9}{100}

We need to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must have at least one member from each party.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary counting. We will first calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members, and then subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats.

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans. This is the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

We also calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Democrats. This is the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee with at least one member from each party is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans or only Democrats:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

The problem requires finding the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

[ADVANCE]

First, we can isolate the expression inside the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]
Next, we can rewrite the equation as a standard quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).

[ADVANCE]

Substituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66

\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \( x \), we select \( x = 66 \).

Let's denote the first integer in the sequence as $x$. Since the integers are consecutive, the sequence can be written as $x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+26$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (average of the first and last term). For this sequence, the sum is $3^7$, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the first and last term is $\frac{x + (x+26)}{2} = x+13$.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 3^7. \]

Since $3^7 = 2187$, we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 27(x+13) = 2187. \]

Now, we solve for $x$:
\[ x+13 = \frac{2187}{27}, \]
\[ x+13 = 81, \]
\[ x = 68. \]

The sequence of integers is $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$. Since there are 27 terms (an odd number), the median is the 14th term in the sequence.

The problem requires finding the real values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We need to break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

[ADVANCE]
First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factor this quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$. Now, we need to find the intervals where this inequality holds true. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$ and $x^2 \geq 0$, we only consider $y \geq 0$. Therefore, the inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ holds true for $0 \leq y < 3$. Substituting back $y = x^2$, we get $0 \leq x^2 < 3$, which simplifies to $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Next, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factored as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ and it equals 0 only when $x^2 = -2$ (which has no real solutions), the inequality $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ is true for all real $x$.

[ADVANCE]
Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. The solution to the first inequality is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$, and the solution to the second inequality is all real $x$. Therefore, the intersection of these solutions is $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

We need to find the value of $xy + yz + zx.$

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,$ we can substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know that:
\[(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $s = x + y + z,$ $p = xy + yz + zx,$ and $q = xyz = 4.$ We can rewrite the above equation as:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the equation $-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p),$ we get:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 2p - p) = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Next, we need to use the third given equation to find a relationship between $s$ and $p.$ We can rewrite the third equation as:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\]
Given that $xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12$ and $xyz = 4,$ we have:
\[12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4,\]
which simplifies to:
\[12 = sp - 12,\]
so:
\[sp = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),\]
\[sp = 24.\]
We can express $p$ in terms of $s$ from the second equation:
\[p = \frac{24}{s}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.\]
So, we have:
\[s^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which simplifies to:
\[s^3 = 64,\]
so:
\[s = 4.\]
Now, we can find $p$:
\[p = \frac{24}{s} = \frac{24}{4} = 6.\]

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

The numerator is an absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative (or zero). The denominator is a quadratic expression \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).

To solve the inequality, we need to consider when the denominator is positive or negative, since the numerator is always non-negative.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) will be satisfied when the denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is negative, since the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative.

We need to find the intervals where \(x(x - 36) < 0\). The roots of the quadratic equation \(x(x - 36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We can test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\): \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), let's test \(x = 1\): \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 37\): \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37 > 0\).

From the tests, we see that the inequality \(x(x - 36) < 0\) is satisfied in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we also need to consider the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, as these values are not in the domain of the original expression. The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values must be excluded from the solution.

Combining the results, we have that the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is satisfied when the denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is negative, which occurs in the interval \((0, 36)\). We also need to exclude the values \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) from the solution because they make the denominator zero.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \(\boxed{(0, 36)}\).

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin T$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$ and the hypotenuse as $h$. Then, $\sin R = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}$. This means the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle $R$, which is also the side opposite to angle $T$. Let's denote this side as $s$. Then, $s = \sqrt{h^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}$.

Now, we need to find $\sin T$. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle $T$, the opposite side is the side we just found, $\sqrt{21}$, and the hypotenuse is still 5. Therefore, $\sin T = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

The problem asks for the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. The distance from the origin to a point $(x, y)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We need to express this distance in terms of $x$ and then find the minimum value.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The distance from the origin to a point $(x, y)$ on the graph is:
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2-3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2-3)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
To find the minimum distance, we can minimize the expression inside the square root. Let's define:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
We need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of $f(x)$ and setting it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]
The critical points are $x = 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$, and $x = -\sqrt{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We evaluate $f(x)$ at the critical points:
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $\frac{5}{2}$, so the minimum distance is:
\[ d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]
The minimum distance can be expressed as $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. Therefore, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $\boxed{12}$.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) and asked to find the value of \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \). To do this, we need to find the inverse functions for the respective pieces of \( f(x) \) and then evaluate them at 0 and 6.

The function \( f(x) \) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3-x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3+2x^2+3x & \text{if } x>3.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find \( f^{-1}(0) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \) for \( x \). We will consider both pieces of the function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 0 \), which gives \( x = 3 \). Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \). Factoring out \( x \), we get \( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \). This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We solve the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \):
\[ x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(-1)(3)}}{2(-1)} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}. \]
This gives us \( x = \frac{-2 + 4}{-2} = -1 \) or \( x = \frac{-2 - 4}{-2} = 3 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid.

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, to find \( f^{-1}(6) \), we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \) for \( x \). Again, we will consider both pieces of the function.

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( 3 - x = 6 \), which gives \( x = -3 \). Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.
2. For \( x > 3 \), we have \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \). Rearranging the equation, we get \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \). We can try to find the roots of this polynomial equation. By inspection, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not a root (since \( 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \)), and \( x = 3 \) is not a root (since \( 3 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \)). We can use numerical methods or further algebraic manipulation to find the roots, but for simplicity, we can check if there are any obvious integer solutions greater than 3. By trying \( x = 6 \), we find that \( -6^3 + 2(6^2) + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \neq 0 \), so \( x = 6 \) is not a solution. However, we can use the Rational Root Theorem or numerical methods to find that \( x = 2 \) is not the correct root, but we can find that \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain, so we need to find another method. After re-evaluating, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not the correct root for the domain \( x > 3 \), but we can use numerical methods to find that \( x = 2 \) is not the correct root, so we need to find another method. After re-evaluating, we find that the correct root for the domain \( x > 3 \) is not an easy solution by hand, but we can use numerical methods to find that the correct root is not an integer, so we will use the solution \( x = -3 \) for the domain \( x \leq 3 \).

Therefore, the only valid solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we can calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \).

- The force applied to both balls is the same.

The problem involves finding the set of values of the expressions $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$ where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$ are the four distinct roots of the polynomial equation $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

By Vieta's formulas for the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$, we have:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.
\]

We need to find the values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. Let's denote these expressions as $a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$.

From the second Vieta's formula, we have:
\[
a + b + c = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of $ab + bc + ca$. We can express $ab + bc + ca$ in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. We have:
\[
ab + bc + ca = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_2 + \alpha_2\alpha_4^2\alpha_3.
\]

Using the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2$, we can simplify the expression. However, a more efficient approach is to use the polynomial and its roots to find the required values.

Next, we can use the fact that the polynomial can be factored into quadratic polynomials, and then find the roots and the required expressions.

Let's solve the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$ by factoring it into quadratic polynomials. We can try to factor it as $(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2$.

By expanding the left-hand side and comparing coefficients, we can find the values of $a, b, c, d$.

After factoring, we can find the roots of the quadratic polynomials and then calculate the required expressions.

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the symmetry and properties of the roots to find the required values.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the sum of the expressions is zero, we can use the properties of the roots to find the required values.

The final answer can be obtained by solving the system of equations or by using the properties of the roots.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. We need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to the center than to any vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region where a point is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining a vertex to the center will divide the rectangle into regions where points are closer to the center or to the vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the line segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will form a smaller rectangle whose center is also $O$. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the line segments joining the center $O$ to the vertices of the original rectangle.

Let's assume the coordinates of $A$ are $(-a, b)$, $B$ are $(a, b)$, $C$ are $(a, -b)$, and $D$ are $(-a, -b)$. The center $O$ is at $(0, 0)$. The midpoint of $OA$ is $\left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)$, the midpoint of $OB$ is $\left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)$, the midpoint of $OC$ is $\left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)$, and the midpoint of $OD$ is $\left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)$.

The area of the smaller rectangle is $\left(\frac{a}{2} - \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right) \times \left(\frac{b}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right) = a \times b = \frac{1}{2} \times 2ab = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Area of } ABCD$.

Since the area of the smaller rectangle is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the area of the original rectangle, the probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to the center than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is $\frac{1}{2}$.

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) for three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise, using the floor function for \( n \geq 4 \) and the ceiling function for \( n < 4 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to evaluate each term separately:
1. For \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), which is less than 4, we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. For \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), which is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. For \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), which is equal to 4, we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

\[
126.59 \text{ dollars} = 12659 \text{ cents}

The problem involves finding the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) given that \(\omega^3 = 1\), where \(\omega\) is a complex number.

[ADVANCE]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3}\). These roots satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We can use this property to simplify the given expression. First, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]
Since \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{2 + (-1)}{2 + (-1)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
However, we need to consider the case when \(\omega = 1\), because in that case, the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is not defined. When \(\omega = 1\), the expression becomes \(\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\).

So, the expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity except when \(\omega = 1\), but we have checked that even in this case the value is 1.

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).

# Route $D \to A \to B \to C \to D$: $5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 20$
# Route $D \to A \to C \to B \to D$: $5 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 19$
# Route $D \to B \to A \to C \to D$: $3 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 19$
# Route $D \to B \to C \to A \to D$: $3 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 19$
# Route $D \to C \to A \to B \to D$: $4 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 19$
# Route $D \to C \to B \to A \to D$: $4 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 20$
# The shortest distance starting from point $D$ is 19.
# The shortest distance among all starting points is 19.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires finding the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$ and visiting the other three points exactly once. After calculating the total distance for each possible route starting from each point, we found that the shortest distance is 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$
