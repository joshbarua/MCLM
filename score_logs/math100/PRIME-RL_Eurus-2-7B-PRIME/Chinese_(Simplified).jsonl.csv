We are given a right triangle $DEF$ with $\angle EFD = 90^\circ$, and $\sin D = 0.7$. We need to find the length of $DE$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}$, we can use the given value of $\sin D = 0.7$ to find the length of $DF$. We know that $EF = 7$, so we can set up the equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Solving for $DF$, we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have the length of $DF$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $DE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that:
\[
DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2
\]
\[
DE^2 + 49 = 100
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

The length of $DE$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$.

We are given complex numbers $z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i$ and $c = 2 - 3i$. We need to find the complex number $w$, which is the result of rotating $z$ around $c$ by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ counterclockwise.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find $w$, we can use the formula for rotating a complex number $z$ around another complex number $c$ by an angle $\theta$: $w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta}$. Here, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$, so $e^{i\theta} = e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

First, we need to calculate $z - c$:
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} + (-3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i. \]

Next, we multiply $z - c$ by $e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$:
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{2} \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right). \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. \]

Finally, we add $c$ to the result to get $w$:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i. \]

The problem requires simplifying the expression $\sqrt{242}$. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root by extracting perfect squares.

[ADVANCE]

First, we find the prime factorization of 242. We start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
Next, we factorize 121, which is a perfect square:
\[ 121 = 11^2 \]
So, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11^2 \]
Now, we can simplify the square root by extracting the perfect square:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

[OUTPUT]

The problem involves finding the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a circular table, with the condition that 3 specific individuals (皮埃尔、罗莎和托马斯) must sit together. We need to account for the circular nature of the table, which means that rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

1. **Treat the 3 individuals as a single block**: Since 皮埃尔、罗莎和托马斯 must sit together, we can treat them as a single block or unit. This reduces the problem to seating 6 units (the 3-person block and the remaining 5 individuals) around a circular table.
2. **Calculate the number of ways to seat the block and the remaining individuals**: The number of ways to arrange $n$ objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$. Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange them in a circle is $(6-1)! = 5!$.
3. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange the 3 individuals within the block**: Within the block, 皮埃尔、罗莎和托马斯 can be arranged in $3!$ ways.
4. **Calculate the total number of distinct arrangements**: The total number of distinct arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the block and the remaining individuals, and the number of ways to arrange the individuals within the block. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is $5! \times 3!$.
5. **Account for the circular nature of the table**: Since rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical, we need to divide by the number of units in the circle, but we have already done this by calculating the circular permutation of 6 units.

The problem asks for the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\). To find the constant term, we need to identify the term in the expansion where the exponent of \(x\) is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The general term in the expansion of \((a+b)^n\) is given by \(\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k\). For the given expression \(\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^{5}\), we have \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is:
\[
\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}x^{3(5-k)}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k}10^{5-k}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^kx^{15-5k}
\]
To find the constant term, we need the exponent of \(x\) to be zero, so we set \(15-5k = 0\) and solve for \(k\):
\[
15-5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). We substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term:
\[
\binom{5}{3}10^{5-3}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3}10^2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion is \(-125\).

We are given that $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, and we need to find the remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7.

[ADVANCE]

Since $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we can substitute $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Now, we need to find the value of $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \pmod{7}$.

We can rewrite $n + 2$, $n + 4$, and $n + 6$ in terms of $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},

\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, we can calculate the product:
\[

We need to find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

[ADVANCE]
In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning that the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. We can use this property to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex.

Let's denote the given vertices as $A(5, 3)$, $B(6, 8)$, and $C(7, 4)$, and the unknown vertex as $D(x, y)$. The midpoint of diagonal $AC$ is $\left(\frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2}\right) = \left(6, \frac{7}{2}\right)$.

The midpoint of diagonal $BD$ is $\left(\frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2}\right)$. Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left(\frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2}\right) = \left(6, \frac{7}{2}\right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 6$ is not a valid solution. This means we need to consider the other possible pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonal $AB$ and $CD$. The midpoint of diagonal $AB$ is $\left(\frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2}\right)$.

The midpoint of diagonal $CD$ is $\left(\frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2}\right)$. Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left(\frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2}\right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]
However, we are given that $x > 7$, so $x = 4$ is not a valid solution. We need to consider the last possible pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonal $AD$ and $BC$. The midpoint of diagonal $AD$ is $\left(\frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2}\right)$.

The midpoint of diagonal $BC$ is $\left(\frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{13}{2}, 6\right)$). Since the midpoints of the diagonals are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left(\frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{13}{2}, 6\right)
\]
This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]
Solving the first equation for $x$:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
Solving the second equation for $y$:
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9

Since $x = 8 > 7$, this solution is valid. Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are $(8, 9)$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

\nBy canceling out the hypotenuse, we get $\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}$.
\nWe know that $\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$, so we can substitute the relationship we found between the opposite and adjacent sides into this expression.

The problem involves finding the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function $f(x)=\frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}$ and then summing the values of the asymptotes.

[ADVANCE]

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine the values of $x$ that make the denominator of the function equal to zero, as long as they do not also make the numerator zero. The denominator of the function is $x^2-5x-14$, which can be factored as $(x-7)(x+2)$. Setting the denominator equal to zero, we get:
\[
(x-7)(x+2) = 0
\]
This equation has solutions $x=7$ and $x=-2$. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at $x=7$ and $x=-2$, so $a=7$ and $b=-2$.

To find the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is at $y=0$, so $c=0$.

[ADVANCE]

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds. This involves understanding the effect of the matrix transformation on the vector \( \bold{v} \).

[ADVANCE]

Let \( \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \). Then,
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The norm of the resulting vector is
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]
We also have
\[
\|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
We need to find the smallest \( C \) such that
\[
\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \le C \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[
4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \le C^2 (x^2 + y^2).
\]
This must hold for all \( x \) and \( y \). To find the smallest \( C \), we can consider the eigenvalues of the matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \), but another approach is to use the fact that the matrix norm (induced by the Euclidean norm) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix \( A^T A \), where \( A \) is the given matrix.

[ADVANCE]

The matrix \( A^T A \) is
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \), we get
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
So, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is 16, and the matrix norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue, which is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) is \( \boxed{4} \).

Since $z^5 = 1$, we can express $z$ as a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are given by $1, \omega, \omega^2, \omega^3, \omega^4$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 5}$. Since $z \neq 1$, we have $z = \omega, \omega^2, \omega^3,$ or $\omega^4$.

We know that the sum of all the fifth roots of unity is zero, i.e., $1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 + \omega^4 = 0$. Therefore, we can write $\omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 + \omega^4 = -1$.

Next, we need to compute $z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$. Since $z^5 = 1$, we have $\frac{1}{z} = z^4$ and $\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3$. Thus, the expression becomes $z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3$.

[ADVANCE]

Using the fact that $\omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 + \omega^4 = -1$, we can substitute $z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1$ into the expression. Therefore, the value of $z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}$ is $-1$.

We start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\), since \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). The expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\sin x \cos x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

\]

We can use the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\) to simplify the numerator:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\sin x \cos x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin x \cos x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.

We are given two key pieces of information:
1. Ten treeks are equivalent in weight to three squigs and one goolee.
2. Two treeks and one goolee are equivalent in weight to one squig.

We can represent these relationships with equations, where $t$ is the weight of a treek, $s$ is the weight of a squig, and $g$ is the weight of a goolee.

The first piece of information gives us the equation:
\[10t = 3s + g \quad \text{(1)}\]

\[2t + g = s \quad \text{(2)}\]

We need to find the value of $t$ in terms of $s$.

We can solve equation (2) for $g$:
\[g = s - 2t \quad \text{(3)}\]

Now, substitute equation (3) into equation (1):

\[10t = 4s - 2t\]
\[12t = 4s\]
\[t = \frac{4s}{12}\]
\[t = \frac{s}{3}\]

This means that the weight of one treek is equal to $\frac{1}{3}$ of the weight of one squig. Therefore, the number of treeks equivalent in weight to one squig is:

The product of the two quadratic expressions $3t^2+5t+a$ and $4t^2+bt-2$ is given by:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We are given that this product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$. By comparing the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we can set up the following equations:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
-2a = 6
\]

[ADVANCE]

From the equation $-2a = 6$, we can solve for $a$:
\[
a = -3
\]
Substituting $a = -3$ into the equation $-10 + ab = -16$, we get:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16
\]
\[
-10 - 3b = -16
\]
\[
-3b = -6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]
We can verify these values by substituting $b = 2$ into the equation $3b + 20 = 26$:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]
This equation holds true. Finally, we substitute $a = -3$ and $b = 2$ into the equation $-6 + 5b + 4a = -8$ to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation also holds true.

[ADVANCE]

Now that we have verified the values of $a$ and $b$, we can find $a + b$:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

The problem involves finding the radius of a circular base of a cylindrical water tank, given the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rising.

We are given:
- The volume of water is increasing at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour.
- The water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour.

We need to find the radius of the circular base of the cylinder.

[ADVANCE]
The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \(r\) is the radius of the base and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

We are given the rate of change of volume \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) and the rate of change of height \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\). We can use the chain rule to relate these rates:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]
Since \(V = \pi r^2 h\), we have \(\frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2\). Substituting this into the chain rule equation gives:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]
We can simplify this equation to solve for \(r\):
\[ 20\pi = 4\pi r^2 \]
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]
\[ r^2 = 5 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

We need to find the maximum value of $a$ such that the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once. This means that the function $f(x)$ must take on all values that a horizontal line can intersect, i.e., the function must be surjective or cover all possible $y$ values.

[ADVANCE]

To ensure that the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the range of the function $f(x)$. The function is defined piecewise, so we need to consider the ranges of both pieces of the function.

For $x \geq a$, the function is $f(x) = ax^2$. Since $x \geq a$, the minimum value of $x$ is $a$, and the corresponding value of $f(x)$ is $f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^2$. As $x$ increases, $f(x) = ax^2$ increases without bound. Therefore, the range of $f(x) = ax^2$ for $x \geq a$ is $[a^2, \infty)$ if $a > 0$, and $( -\infty, a^2]$ if $a < 0$.

For $x < a$, the function is $f(x) = ax + 2a$. Since $x < a$, the maximum value of $x$ approaches $a$ from the left, and the corresponding value of $f(x)$ approaches $f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a$. As $x$ decreases without bound, $f(x) = ax + 2a$ decreases without bound if $a > 0$, and increases without bound if $a < 0$. Therefore, the range of $f(x) = ax + 2a$ for $x < a$ is $(-\infty, a^2 + 2a)$ if $a > 0$, and $(a^2 + 2a, -\infty)$ if $a < 0$.

To ensure that the function $f(x)$ covers all possible $y$ values, the ranges of both pieces of the function must together cover the entire real line. This means that the minimum value of the range of $f(x) = ax^2$ must be less than or equal to the maximum value of the range of $f(x) = ax + 2a$.

[ADVANCE]

If $a > 0$, the range of $f(x) = ax^2$ is $[a^2, \infty)$ and the range of $f(x) = ax + 2a$ is $(-\infty, a^2 + 2a)$. To cover the entire real line, we need $a^2 \leq a^2 + 2a$, which is always true for $a > 0$. However, we also need to ensure that the range of $f(x)$ covers the values between the two ranges, which means $a^2 + 2a \geq a^2$, simplifying to $2a \geq 0$, which is also always true for $a > 0$. But we need to find the maximum $a$ such that the function covers all $y$ values. We notice that as $a$ increases, the gap between the minimum of the quadratic part and the maximum of the linear part increases. We need to find the point where the function starts to miss some horizontal lines.

If $a < 0$, the range of $f(x) = ax^2$ is $(-\infty, a^2]$ and the range of $f(x) = ax + 2a$ is $(a^2 + 2a, -\infty)$. To cover the entire real line, we need $a^2 \geq a^2 + 2a$, which simplifies to $0 \geq 2a$, and since $a < 0$, this is always true. However, we need to ensure that the range of $f(x)$ covers the entire real line, which means the maximum of the quadratic part should be greater than or equal to the minimum of the linear part. We need to find the maximum $a$ such that the function covers all $y$ values.

We need to find the critical value of $a$ where the function starts to miss some horizontal lines. We notice that if $a = -1$, the range of $f(x) = ax^2$ is $(-\infty, 1]$ and the range of $f(x) = ax + 2a$ is $(-1, -\infty)$. This covers the entire real line. If $a > -1$, the gap between the two ranges increases, and the function will start to miss some horizontal lines.

Therefore, the maximum value of $a$ such that the graph of $y=f(x)$ intersects every horizontal line at least once is $a = -1$.

The problem involves finding the value of \( c \) that makes the radius of the circle described by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) equal to 1. To solve this, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h,k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

[ADVANCE]
To rewrite the equation in standard form, we need to complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

The given equation is:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

 Completing the square for the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

 Completing the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Substituting these back into the original equation, we get:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation is now in the standard form of a circle, \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\).

Since the radius of the circle is given as 1, we can set up the equation:
\[ r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \]
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

[ADVANCE]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

So, the value of \( c \) that makes the radius of the circle equal to 1 is \( \boxed{33} \).

We are given a function $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$, where $0 \le \lambda \le 4$, and we need to find the values of $\lambda$ such that there exists $x \in [0,1]$ satisfying $f(x) \neq x$ and $f(f(x)) = x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the given conditions, we first need to compute $f(f(x))$. We start by finding $f(x)$:
\[f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) = \lambda x - \lambda x^2.\]
Now, we substitute $f(x)$ into the function $f$ to get $f(f(x))$:
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x - \lambda x^2) = \lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]
We are given that $f(f(x)) = x$, so we set the expression equal to $x$:
\[\lambda (\lambda x - \lambda x^2) (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
This equation must have a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(x) \neq x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To simplify the problem, we can first consider the case when $x = 0$ or $x = 1$. If $x = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ and $f(f(x)) = 0$, which satisfies $f(f(x)) = x$. However, this does not satisfy the condition $f(x) \neq x$ since $f(0) = 0$. Similarly, if $x = 1$, then $f(x) = 0$ and $f(f(x)) = 0$, which again does not satisfy the condition $f(x) \neq x$.

Now, we assume $x \neq 0$ and $x \neq 1$. We can also consider the fixed points of the function $f(x)$, i.e., the values of $x$ such that $f(x) = x$. We solve the equation:
\[\lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ (which we already excluded) and $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$. We need to ensure that $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \in [0,1]$ and $f(x) \neq x$ for some $x$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We substitute $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ to find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition. First, we compute $f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)$:
\[f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = (\lambda - 1) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.\]
This means that $x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}$ is a fixed point of the function $f(x)$, and we need to find $\lambda$ such that there exists another $x$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = x$ and $f(x) \neq x$.

We need to solve the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ for $\lambda$. After some algebraic manipulations, we can find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the equation. However, we can also use the fact that the function $f(x)$ is a quadratic function, and the composition $f(f(x))$ is a quartic function. We can use the properties of quadratic functions to find the values of $\lambda$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that the function $f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)$ has a maximum value at $x = \frac{1}{2}$, which is $\frac{\lambda}{4}$. For the function $f(f(x))$ to have a solution $x \in [0,1]$ such that $f(f(x)) = x$ and $f(x) \neq x$, the value of $\lambda$ must be such that the function $f(f(x))$ intersects the line $y = x$ at some point other than the fixed points of $f(x)$.

By analyzing the function $f(f(x))$ and the line $y = x$, we can find the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition. After solving the equation $f(f(x)) = x$, we find that the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the condition are $\lambda = 2$ and $\lambda = 4$.

The problem requires finding the minimum positive angle $\theta$ such that the given expression for $\tan \theta$ is satisfied. The expression involves trigonometric functions of various angles, and we need to simplify it to find $\theta$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We start by simplifying the given expression for $\tan \theta$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]
We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identity, we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{85^\circ - 25^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator. We can rewrite it using the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
So, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the difference-to-product identity, we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Now, we can substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the expression for $\tan \theta$:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
We know that $\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}$, so the minimum positive angle $\theta$ is $120^\circ$.

There are repeated letters: 2 E's and 2 L's.

To find the number of distinct permutations, we will use the formula for permutations of a multiset.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a multiset is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"", we have:
- Total number of letters, \( n = 7 \)
- Frequency of E, \( n_1 = 2 \)
- Frequency of L, \( n_2 = 2 \)
- Frequency of I, \( n_3 = 1 \)
- Frequency of P, \( n_4 = 1 \)

To determine the number of trailing zeros, we need to find the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of $42!$.

The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \( f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum value of the function, we can use trigonometric substitution. Let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), where \( \theta \) and \( \phi \) are angles in the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta, \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). This substitution is valid because \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

Then, we have \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \cos \phi \).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta. \]

Using the angle addition formula, we can simplify this to:
\[ f(x,y) = \sin (\theta + \phi). \]

The maximum value of \( \sin (\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Since \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), we have \( y = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \cos \theta \).

Thus, \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \cos \theta \). We can choose \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), which gives \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

The area of triangle $OAB$ can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors $\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}$.

First, we need to calculate the cross product $\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}$. The cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is given by:

\]
For our vectors $\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(1) - (3)(-2) \\ (3)(-3) - (1)(1) \\ (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ -9 - 1 \\ -2 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}.

The area of triangle $OAB$ is half the magnitude of the cross product:

Let's denote \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \beta = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). We know that \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \).

Given \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \alpha \), we can rewrite it as \( z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0 \). The solutions to this quadratic equation are \( z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2} \).

Since \( \alpha^2 - 4 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4} = \frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm i \sqrt{4 - \alpha^2}}{2} \).

We can express \( z \) in polar form. Notice that \( \alpha^2 - 4 = -\left( \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \), so \( z \) can be written as \( z = e^{i\theta} \) or \( z = e^{-i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is such that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\alpha}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

This value of \( \cos \theta \) corresponds to \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \).

Now, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = \left( e^{i\pi/5} \right)^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = \left( e^{-i\pi/5} \right)^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \).

In both cases, \( z^{85} = -1 \), so \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 \). Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

We are given a triangle $ABC$ with area 144, and we need to find the area of triangle $ENG$, where $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, and $M$ and $N$ are points on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, such that $MN$ is parallel to $BC$ and passes through $G$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, we know that it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Also, since $MN$ is parallel to $BC$, triangle $AMN$ is similar to triangle $ABC$.

The centroid $G$ divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Since the area of triangle $ABC$ is 144, the area of each of these smaller triangles is $\frac{144}{6} = 24$.

Triangle $ENG$ is one of these smaller triangles, so its area is also 24.

\nThe total number of books is 24, and we need to find the proportion of math books after removing 2 books from each shelf.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
\nFirst, calculate the total number of books removed from the bookshelf. Since 2 books are removed from each of the 3 shelves, the total number of books removed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\).
\nNext, calculate the total number of books remaining on the bookshelf. The initial total number of books is 24, and 6 books are removed, so the remaining number of books is \(24 - 6 = 18\).

Given:
- The fourth term $a_4 = 200$
- The eighth term $a_8 = 500$

We need to find the sixth term $a_6$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can use the formula for the nth term to set up two equations based on the given information:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $a_1$:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference $d$, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find $a_1$. We'll use the first equation:
\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have $a_1$ and $d$, we can find the sixth term $a_6$:
\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]

The problem requires converting the fraction $\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}$ into a finite decimal. To do this, we need to express the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10, which is $2 \cdot 5$. The given denominator is $2^2 \cdot 5^7$, so we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $2^5$ to make the denominator $10^7$.

First, we need to find the prime factorization of 100 and 150:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The GCD of 100 and 150 is the product of the lowest powers of all common prime factors:

[ADVANCE]

To determine the possible values of $n$, we need to find the divisors of 24, because $2^{24}$ can be expressed as $(2^{\frac{24}{n}})^n$, and $\frac{24}{n}$ must be an integer. The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since $n > 1$, we exclude 1 from the list of divisors.

\[ x = 4 \]

The problem involves selecting two random prime numbers from the first six prime numbers and finding the probability that their sum is even.

The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

[ADVANCE]

To get an even sum, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd. Since there is only one even prime number (2) among the first six prime numbers, the only way to get an even sum is for both Paul and Jesse to choose an odd prime number.

There are 5 odd prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) out of the 6 prime numbers. The probability that Paul chooses an odd prime number is $\frac{5}{6}$, and the probability that Jesse chooses an odd prime number is also $\frac{5}{6}$.

Since the choices are independent, the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an odd prime number is $\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}$.

However, we also need to consider the case where both choose the even prime number 2, which would result in an even sum. The probability that Paul chooses 2 is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability that Jesse chooses 2 is also $\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that both choose 2 is $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$.

The total probability that the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events: $\frac{25}{36} + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}$.

Given these constraints, we need to find the smallest number consisting of only the digits 0 and 1 that ends in 00 and has a digit sum that is a multiple of 9.

The wheel is divided into 12 equal sections, numbered from 1 to 12. When the first number is divided by 4, the possible remainders are 1, 2, and 3, which correspond to the columns of the grid. We need to determine the probability of each remainder.

The numbers on the wheel that give a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 are 1, 5, 9. The numbers that give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 are 2, 6, 10. The numbers that give a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 are 3, 7, 11. Therefore, the probability of each remainder is $\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$.

When the second number is divided by 5, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 4, which correspond to the rows of the grid. We need to determine the probability of each remainder.

The numbers on the wheel that give a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 are 1, 6, 11. The numbers that give a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 are 2, 7, 12. The numbers that give a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are 3, 8, 13 (but since the wheel only goes up to 12, we consider 3, 8). The numbers that give a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 are 4, 9. Therefore, the probability of each remainder is $\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$ for remainders 1, 2, and 3, and $\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}$ for remainder 4.

Next, we need to determine the total number of shaded squares in the grid and the total number of squares in the grid. The grid has 6 columns and 4 rows, making a total of $6 \times 4 = 24$ squares. The shaded squares are those in the first and third columns and the first and third rows.

The problem asks for the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction $\frac{4321}{5^7\cdot2^8}$.

To solve this, we need to express the fraction in a form that makes its decimal representation clear. Since the denominator is $5^7 \cdot 2^8$, we can rewrite it to have the form $10^k \cdot 2^m$ where $k$ and $m$ are integers. This will help us convert the fraction into a decimal.

[ADVANCE]

First, we can rewrite the denominator to have the same power of 10:
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2.\]

So, the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{200000000}.\]

Now, we can perform the division to find the decimal representation:
\[\frac{4321}{200000000} = 0.000021605.\]

Next, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation $0.000021605$. We can ignore the decimal point and sum the digits:

So, the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction is 14.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity $\sin x = \sin (180^\circ - x)$ to rewrite the expression in terms of sines of angles less than $90^\circ$. This gives us:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So the original expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2.
\]
We know that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Substituting this value in, we get:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2.
\]
Next, we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x-y) - \cos (x+y)].
\]
We can apply this identity to $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ$:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (20^\circ - 40^\circ) - \cos (20^\circ + 40^\circ)] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (-20^\circ) - \cos 60^\circ] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 20^\circ - \frac{1}{2}] = \frac{1}{2} \cos 20^\circ - \frac{1}{4}.
\]
So,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos 20^\circ - \frac{1}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 20^\circ - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ + \frac{1}{16}.
\]
We can use the identity $\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}$ to simplify $\cos^2 20^\circ$:
\[
\cos^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 + \cos 40^\circ}{2}.
\]
Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \cos^2 20^\circ - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 40^\circ}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1 + \cos 40^\circ}{8} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ + \frac{1}{16}.
\]
Combining the terms, we have:
\[
\frac{1 + \cos 40^\circ}{8} + \frac{1}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ = \frac{2 + 2 \cos 40^\circ + 1}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ = \frac{3 + 2 \cos 40^\circ}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity $\cos 40^\circ = 2 \cos^2 20^\circ - 1$ to further simplify:
\[
\frac{3 + 2 \cos 40^\circ}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ = \frac{3 + 2 (2 \cos^2 20^\circ - 1)}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ = \frac{3 + 4 \cos^2 20^\circ - 2}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1 + 4 \cos^2 20^\circ}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ.
\]
Substituting $\cos^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 + \cos 40^\circ}{2}$ again, we get:
\[
\frac{1 + 4 \cdot \frac{1 + \cos 40^\circ}{2}}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1 + 2 + 2 \cos 40^\circ}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ = \frac{3 + 2 \cos 40^\circ}{16} - \frac{1}{4} \cos 20^\circ.
\]
We can use the identity for the product of sines again to find a different approach. We know that:
\[
\sin 10^\circ \sin 30^\circ \sin 50^\circ \sin 70^\circ = \frac{1}{16}.
\]
And by using the identity $\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)$, we can rewrite the expression in terms of cosines. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.

Next, we can use the identity:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
By setting $x = 20^\circ$, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
We also know that:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ.
\]
So, the original expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]
Therefore, the value of the given expression is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}.

The problem asks us to identify the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\).

In cylindrical coordinates, \(r\) and \(\theta\) represent the radial distance and azimuthal angle in the \(xy\)-plane, respectively, and \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) indicates that the height above the \(xy\)-plane is constant, regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). This means that for any value of \(r\) and \(\theta\), the \(z\)-coordinate is the same.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Given that the \(z\)-coordinate is constant and can take any value for \(r\) and \(\theta\), the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane. This is because the equation \(z = c\) is independent of \(r\) and \(\theta\), meaning it extends infinitely in the radial and azimuthal directions.

We are given the magnitudes of vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ as $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2$ and $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7$, respectively. We are also given the cross product of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ as $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$. We need to find the minimum possible angle between vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in degrees.

[ADVANCE]

The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is given by $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. We can calculate the magnitude of the given cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, we have:
\[
7 = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta = 14 \sin \theta.
\]
Solving for $\sin \theta$, we get:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
The angle $\theta$ that satisfies $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$ is $\theta = 30^\circ$ or $\theta = 150^\circ$. Since we are asked for the minimum possible angle, we take $\theta = 30^\circ$.

The problem involves two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. We need to find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$.

The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$. The function $g(x)$ is defined as $g(x) = f(x + 5)$. To find the sum of the roots of $g(x)$, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \cdots + z$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the $x^{n-1}$ term and $a$ is the leading coefficient.

Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, we can substitute $x + 5$ into the function $f(x)$ to get the expression for $g(x)$. However, we don't need to expand the expression for $g(x)$ completely. Instead, we can use the property of polynomial roots that the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is equal to the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ shifted by $-5$.

The sum of the roots of $f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015$ is given by the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, which is $-(-49) = 49$. Since $g(x) = f(x + 5)$, the sum of the roots of $g(x)$ is $49 - 5 = 44$.

The problem requires us to compute the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). We need to simplify this expression step by step.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\) and \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x\). However, it might be more useful to express everything in terms of \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) to see if we can apply any trigonometric identities.

The expression becomes:
\[

\]

We can use the identity \(\sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x\) and \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\), but it's not immediately clear how to simplify the expression further using these identities. We need to look for a different approach.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can use the identity \(\csc^2 x = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x}\) and try to find a common thread among the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\). Notice that these angles are related to the angle \(70^\circ\) through the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities or the identity for the sum of squares of sine and cosine functions. However, a more straightforward approach might be to use the identity for the sum of cotangents and tangents squared.

We can also use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ - x)} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ + x)} = 12.

However, our original expression is in terms of \(\cos^2 10^\circ\), \(\sin^2 20^\circ\), and \(\sin^2 40^\circ\). We need to find a way to express \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\) in terms of sine squared functions or find a direct relation.

We can use the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) to rewrite \(\sin 70^\circ = \cos 20^\circ\) and \(\sin 50^\circ = \cos 40^\circ\).

Now, we need to express \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\) in a similar form. We can use the identity:

However, this doesn't directly help us. We need to find a relation between the terms.

We can use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{\sin^2 (90^\circ - x) + \cos^2 (90^\circ - x)}{\cos^2 (90^\circ - x)} = \tan^2 (90^\circ - x) + 1 = \cot^2 x + 1.

The problem involves finding the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$. We need to use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.

[ADVANCE]
Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as $n$ and the unknown interior angle as $x$. The sum of all interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}$. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is $1070^{\circ}$, so we can write the equation:
\[
(n-2) \times 180^{\circ} - x = 1070^{\circ}
\]
Since $x$ is an interior angle of a convex polygon, we know that $0^{\circ} < x < 180^{\circ}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the sum of all interior angles:
\[
(n-2) \times 180^{\circ} = 1070^{\circ} + x
\]
Since $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}$ must be an integer multiple of $180^{\circ}$, we can find the range of possible values for $n$ by solving the inequality:
\[
1070^{\circ} < (n-2) \times 180^{\circ} < 1070^{\circ} + 180^{\circ}
\]
Simplifying the inequality, we get:
\[
1070^{\circ} < (n-2) \times 180^{\circ} < 1250^{\circ}
\]
Dividing by $180^{\circ}$, we get:
\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]
\[
5.944 < n-2 < 6.944
\]
Since $n-2$ must be an integer, the only possible value for $n-2$ is 6. Therefore, $n = 8$.

[VERIFY]
We need to verify that the solution $n = 8$ is valid by checking if the interior angle $x$ is within the range of a convex polygon. If $n = 8$, the sum of all interior angles is:
\[
(8-2) \times 180^{\circ} = 6 \times 180^{\circ} = 1080^{\circ}
\]
The unknown interior angle $x$ is:
\[
x = 1080^{\circ} - 1070^{\circ} = 10^{\circ}
\]
Since $0^{\circ} < 10^{\circ} < 180^{\circ}$, the solution is valid.

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is $\boxed{8}$.

[ADVANCE]

We can express the given condition as:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \). We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \).

[ADVANCE]

We can check the squares of integers from 0 to 22 to find the value of \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \):
\[ 0^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) and \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 - 5 \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \), we discard \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \) and keep \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \).

The unique odd integer \( t \) that satisfies the given conditions is \( \boxed{17} \).

[ADVANCE]
We know that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x > 0\), and \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \pi + \tan^{-1} (x)\) for \(x < 0\). Therefore, we can simplify the argument of the sine function.

For \(x > 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) = 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
For \(x < 0\):
\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x) + \pi + \tan^{-1} (x) = \pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x).
\]
We can now rewrite the original equation as:
\[
\sin (2 \tan^{-1} (x)) = \frac{1}{3} \quad \text{for} \quad x > 0,
\]
and
\[
\sin (\pi + 2 \tan^{-1} (x)) = \frac{1}{3} \quad \text{for} \quad x < 0.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (\pi + \theta) = -\sin \theta\), the second equation becomes:
\[
-\sin (2 \tan^{-1} (x)) = \frac{1}{3} \quad \text{for} \quad x < 0,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\sin (2 \tan^{-1} (x)) = -\frac{1}{3} \quad \text{for} \quad x < 0.
\]
We can use the double-angle identity for sine: \(\sin (2 \theta) = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 + \tan^2 \theta}\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), then \(\tan \theta = x\), and we have:

\sin (2 \tan^{-1} (x)) = \frac{2x}{1 + x^2}.
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3} \quad \text{for} \quad x > 0,
\]
and
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = -\frac{1}{3} \quad \text{for} \quad x < 0.
\]
We can now solve these equations for \(x\).

[ADVANCE]
For \(x > 0\):
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3} \implies 6x = 1 + x^2 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \(x > 0\), we have \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

For \(x < 0\):
\[
\frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = -\frac{1}{3} \implies 6x = -1 - x^2 \implies x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \(x < 0\), we have \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

[OUTPUT]
The solutions to the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

The final answer is: \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}, -3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).

We are given two lines in vector form, and we need to find the distance between them. The first line is defined by the equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
and the second line is defined by the equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
We are told that these lines are parallel.

[ADVANCE]

Since the lines are parallel, the direction vectors of the lines are scalar multiples of each other. We can see that the direction vector of the second line is $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$, which is $2$ times the direction vector of the first line $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$. This confirms that the lines are parallel.

To find the distance between two parallel lines, we can use the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\left| (\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \right|}{\left| \mathbf{d} \right|},
\]
where $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$ are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and $\mathbf{d}$ is the direction vector of the lines.

We can choose $\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$, and the direction vector $\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$.

First, we calculate the vector $\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1$:
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we calculate the cross product $(\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1) \times \mathbf{d}$:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Then, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\left| \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \right| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

We also calculate the magnitude of the direction vector $\mathbf{d}$:
\[
\left| \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we calculate the distance between the two lines:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\left| (\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \right|}{\left| \mathbf{d} \right|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

To find the number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangular region, we need to count the number of integer points within the bounds of the rectangle, excluding the boundary points. The$x$-coordinates of the interior points range from $-4$ to $4$ (a total of $9$ integers), and the $y$-coordinates range from $-3$ to $3$ (a total of $7$ integers).

We are given three vectors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, and we need to compute the cross product $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ using the provided information about the cross products of $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the distributive property of the cross product to expand the expression:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}).
\]
Since the cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector, $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$, the expression further simplifies to:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]
We also know that $\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}$, so the expression becomes:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]
Now, we can substitute the given values:
\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

We will perform the scalar multiplication and then the subtraction.

\[

The total number of stamps from the 70s is:

We are given a梯形 $ABCD$ with $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$, and $\overline{AC}$ 平分角 $\angle BAD$. The area of the梯形 $ABCD$ is given as $42$. We need to find the area of $\triangle ACD$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $\overline{AC}$ 平分角 $\angle BAD$, we can denote the angle $\angle BAC$ as $\alpha$, then $\angle CAD$ is also $\alpha$. Let $\angle ACB = \theta$, then $\angle ACD = 90^\circ$ because $\overline{AC}\perp\overline{CD}$.

The area of the梯形 $ABCD$ can be expressed as the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle ACD$. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle: $[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin(\angle BAC)$ and $[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot AD \cdot \sin(\angle CAD)$.

Since $\overline{AD}|| \overline{BC}$, we have $\angle ABC = \angle ADC = 90^\circ - \alpha$. Also, because $\overline{AC}$ 平分角 $\angle BAD$, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem in $\triangle ABD$ to relate the sides.

However, we can also use the fact that the area of the梯形 is the sum of the areas of the two triangles and the relationship between the heights and bases of the triangles.

Let's denote the length of $\overline{AC}$ as $h$, the length of $\overline{BC}$ as $a$, and the length of $\overline{AD}$ as $b$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot h$ and the area of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h$.

The area of the梯形 $ABCD$ is $[ABCD] = [ABC] + [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot h + \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot (a + b) = 42$.

We need to find the ratio of the areas of $\triangle ACD$ to the梯形 $ABCD$. Since $\overline{AC}$ 平分角 $\angle BAD$, the height from $A$ to $\overline{BC}$ and the height from $A$ to $\overline{CD}$ are the same, which is $h$. The area of $\triangle ACD$ is half of the area of the梯形 $ABCD$ because the height is the same and the base $\overline{AD}$ is part of the base of the梯形.

Therefore, $[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21$.

The problem involves solving an equation with a square root to find the value of $x$. The equation is $\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}=\frac{3}{2}$.

[ADVANCE]
To solve for $x$, we can start by squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]
Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for $x$:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]
Rearranging the terms gives:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]
\[
-19x = -9
\]
Dividing both sides by $-19$ yields:
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

[VERIFY]
We need to ensure that the solution satisfies the original equation and that the expression inside the square roots is non-negative. Substituting $x = \frac{9}{19}$ into the original equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27-19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
The solution satisfies the original equation. Additionally, we check that the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative:
\[
2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} > 0
\]
\[
3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - 1 = \frac{27-19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0

We can substitute the given values into the operation definition: $\frac{7}{30}@\frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)$. Now, we can perform the calculation step by step.

First, multiply the numerators: $(7)(10) = 70$.

Next, simplify the fraction $\frac{21}{30}$ to its lowest terms. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 21 and 30 is 3, so we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3: $\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}$.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of circular permutations and the properties of intersecting chords. When four points are chosen on a circle, the line segments they form will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating manner (i.e., the points are in the order $ABCD$ or $ADCB$ when traveling around the circle).

[ADVANCE]
Consider the four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ on the circle. When these points are connected to form two line segments, there are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the endpoints of the line segments. However, only two of these combinations will result in intersecting line segments, namely $AB$ and $CD$, or $AD$ and $BC$.

[ADVANCE]
The total number of ways to arrange four points on a circle is $(4-1)! = 3! = 6$. For each arrangement, there are 3 ways to pair the points into two line segments. Out of these 3 pairings, only 1 will result in intersecting line segments.

We are given two circles with the same center $D$, and radii of $1$ and $2$ respectively. The shaded area is the area between the two circles, and it is given that this shaded area is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle. We need to find the measure of $\angle ADC$.

[ADVANCE]
The area of the larger circle is $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$. The shaded area is $\frac{5}{12}$ of the area of the larger circle, so the shaded area is $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}$.

Let's denote the measure of $\angle ADC$ as $\theta$. The area of the sector $ADC$ of the larger circle is $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \cdot \pi$. The area of the sector $ADC$ of the smaller circle is $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi$.

The shaded area is the difference between the area of the sector $ADC$ of the larger circle and the area of the sector $ADC$ of the smaller circle:
\[
\frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \cdot \pi - \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{\theta}{90^\circ} - \frac{\theta}{360^\circ}\right) \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
\[
\left(\frac{4\theta - \theta}{360^\circ}\right) \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
\[
\frac{3\theta}{360^\circ} \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
\[
\frac{\theta}{120^\circ} \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \cdot \frac{120^\circ}{\pi} = 200^\circ.
\]

However, since $\theta$ is an angle in a circle, it should be less than $360^\circ$. We need to consider the fraction of the circle that the shaded area represents. The correct approach is to find the fraction of the circle's area that the sector represents.

Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the fraction of the circle's area that the sector represents. The area of the sector of the larger circle is $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{4\theta\pi}{360^\circ} = \frac{\theta\pi}{90^\circ}$. The area of the sector of the smaller circle is $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi = \frac{\theta\pi}{360^\circ}$. The shaded area is the difference between these two areas:
\[
\frac{\theta\pi}{90^\circ} - \frac{\theta\pi}{360^\circ} = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{4\theta\pi - \theta\pi}{360^\circ} = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
\[
\frac{3\theta\pi}{360^\circ} = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
\[
\frac{\theta}{120^\circ} = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
\[
\theta = \frac{5}{3} \cdot 120^\circ = 200^\circ.
\]

Since $\theta$ represents the angle at the center of the circle, and we are looking for the measure of $\angle ADC$, we need to consider the fraction of the circle that the shaded area represents. The correct answer should be the angle that corresponds to the shaded area being $\frac{5}{12}$ of the larger circle's area.

Let's convert the fraction of the area to the corresponding angle. The area of the larger circle is $4\pi$, and the shaded area is $\frac{5\pi}{3}$. The total area of the sectors of the larger and smaller circles should add up to the shaded area. Let's denote the angle as $\theta$. The area of the sector of the larger circle is $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4\pi$, and the area of the sector of the smaller circle is $\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi$. The difference between these areas is the shaded area:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4\pi - \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{3\theta\pi}{360^\circ} = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]
\[
\frac{\theta}{120^\circ} = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
\[
\theta = 200^\circ.
\]

However, we need to consider the angle in the context of the circle. The correct answer should be the angle that corresponds to the shaded area being $\frac{5}{12}$ of the larger circle's area. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The area of the larger circle is $4\pi$, and the shaded area is $\frac{5\pi}{3}$. The fraction of the area of the larger circle that the shaded area represents is $\frac{\frac{5\pi}{3}}{4\pi} = \frac{5}{12}$. This fraction corresponds to the fraction of the circle's angle. Since the total angle of the circle is $360^\circ$, the angle corresponding to the shaded area is:
\[
\theta = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 360^\circ = 150^\circ.
\]

Therefore, the measure of $\angle ADC$ is $\boxed{150}$.

Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the angle sum and difference identities for sine, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha
\]

We also know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we can substitute the values of \(\sin \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), \(\cos \alpha\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4\sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{25} = \frac{5\sqrt{21} - 4\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}
\]

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50} = \frac{(2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})\sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2\sqrt{63} + 21}{500} = \frac{2 \cdot 3\sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{6\sqrt{7} + 21}{500}
\]

However, we can simplify this problem using the product-to-sum identities. We know that:
\[
\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) - \cos (A + B)]
\]
Let \(A = \alpha + \beta\) and \(B = \beta - \alpha\), then:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos ((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha)) - \cos ((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha))] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2\alpha) - \cos (2\beta)]
\]
Using the double-angle identity for cosine, \(\cos 2\theta = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\), we get:
\[
\cos 2\alpha = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]
\[
\cos 2\beta = 1 - 2\sin^2 \beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]
So,
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.18 = 0.09
\]

\nThe problem involves converting the speed of a bicycle from feet per minute to inches per second. We need to perform unit conversions to arrive at the final answer.

\n[ADVANCE]
\nFirst, we convert the speed from feet per minute to feet per second. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide the speed by 60:
\[ 20 \text{ feet/minute} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ feet/second} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet/second} \]

\nNext, we convert the speed from feet per second to inches per second. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply the speed by 12:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet/second} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ inches/second} = 4 \text{ inches/second} \]

The problem requires us to find the number of ways to form a 5-member committee from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that each party must have at least one member.

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to consider all possible distributions of Republicans (R) and Democrats (D) in the committee, ensuring that both parties are represented. The possible distributions are:

1. 1R and 4D
2. 2R and 3D
3. 3R and 2D
4. 4R and 1D

We will calculate the number of ways for each distribution and then sum them up.

[ADVANCE]

1. For 1R and 4D:
   - The number of ways to choose 1 Republican from 8 is $\binom{8}{1} = 8$.
   - The number of ways to choose 4 Democrats from 6 is $\binom{6}{4} = 15$.
   - The total number of ways for this distribution is $8 \times 15 = 120$.

2. For 2R and 3D:
   - The number of ways to choose 2 Republicans from 8 is $\binom{8}{2} = 28$.
   - The number of ways to choose 3 Democrats from 6 is $\binom{6}{3} = 20$.
   - The total number of ways for this distribution is $28 \times 20 = 560$.

3. For 3R and 2D:
   - The number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 is $\binom{8}{3} = 56$.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 is $\binom{6}{2} = 15$.
   - The total number of ways for this distribution is $56 \times 15 = 840$.

4. For 4R and 1D:
   - The number of ways to choose 4 Republicans from 8 is $\binom{8}{4} = 70$.
   - The number of ways to choose 1 Democrat from 6 is $\binom{6}{1} = 6$.
   - The total number of ways for this distribution is $70 \times 6 = 420$.

[ADVANCE]

The total number of ways to form the committee is the sum of the number of ways for each distribution:

\[513 - 487 = 26,\]

\nLet's denote the three consecutive integers as \(n-1\), \(n\), and \(n+1\).
\nThe product of these integers is given by \((n-1)n(n+1) = 120\).
\nThe average of these integers is \(\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n\).
\nWe are also given that the product divided by the average is 24, so \(\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24\).
\nThis simplifies to \((n-1)(n+1) = 24\), which further simplifies to \(n^2 - 1 = 24\), or \(n^2 = 25\).

The problem requires finding the positive value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$.

[ADVANCE]
We start by isolating the expression inside the cube root. Since $\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$, we can cube both sides of the equation to get rid of the cube root:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3.
\]
We know that $16^3 = (2^4)^3 = 2^{12} = 4096$, so the equation becomes:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.
\]
Next, we can simplify the equation by moving 4096 to the left side:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = -4092$.

[ADVANCE]
We can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}.
\]
We know that $\sqrt{16384} = \sqrt{2^{14}} = 2^7 = 128$, so the equation becomes:
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}.
\]
This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66,
\]
and
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62.
\]
Since the problem specifies that $x$ is a positive number, we discard the negative solution $x = -62$.

Therefore, the positive value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 66$.

We can use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} - 2 \pi \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

So the expression becomes \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\) to simplify the expression. Let's multiply and divide the expression by \(\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)\) to use the double-angle identity for sine.

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity \(\sin (2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x\), we get:

Using the double-angle identity again:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}
\]

Since \(\sin (\pi + x) = -\sin x\) and \(\cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8} (-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)) (-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right))}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{8} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}

Using the double-angle identity again:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{16} \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)}{\sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{16}

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote $\angle BAC = \alpha$. Then, $\angle BDC = 3\alpha$. Since $AM$ is the height of the triangle, $\angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ$. We can use the fact that $\angle BDC = \angle BDA + \angle CDA$ and the exterior angle theorem to relate the angles.

Since $\angle BDC = 3\alpha$ and $\angle BDA$ and $\angle CDA$ are related to the angles of triangle $ABD$ and $ACD$, we can use the tangent function to relate the angles and the sides of the triangles.

Let's denote $BM = CM = x$, then $BC = 2x$. We can use the tangent function in triangles $ABM$ and $DBM$ to find the relationship between the sides and the angles.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

In triangle $ABM$, we have $\tan \alpha = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}$. In triangle $DBM$, we have $\tan 2\alpha = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x$. We can use the double-angle identity for tangent: $\tan 2\alpha = \frac{2\tan \alpha}{1 - \tan^2 \alpha}$. Substituting $\tan \alpha = \frac{x}{11}$ into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[
x = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{x}{11}}{1 - \left(\frac{x}{11}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{2x}{11}}{1 - \frac{x^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{2x}{11}}{\frac{121 - x^2}{121}} = \frac{2x \cdot 121}{11(121 - x^2)} = \frac{22x}{121 - x^2}.
\]
We can simplify this equation to solve for $x$:
\[
x(121 - x^2) = 22x \implies 121x - x^3 = 22x \implies x^3 - 99x = 0 \implies x(x^2 - 99) = 0.
\]
Since $x \neq 0$, we have $x^2 = 99 \implies x = \sqrt{99} = 3\sqrt{11}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now that we have $x = 3\sqrt{11}$, we can find the length of $AB$. In triangle $ABM$, we have $AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + (3\sqrt{11})^2 = 121 + 99 = 220 \implies AB = \sqrt{220} = 2\sqrt{55}$.

Since $AB = AC$, the perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is $AB + AC + BC = 2\sqrt{55} + 2\sqrt{55} + 6\sqrt{11} = 4\sqrt{55} + 6\sqrt{11}$.

However, we need to verify if the calculated value is correct and in the required format.

The problem involves finding the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is $3^7$. Since the integers are consecutive, we can represent them as $n, n+1, n+2, \ldots, n+26$, where $n$ is the smallest integer.

The sum of these 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as:
\[ n + (n+1) + (n+2) + \cdots + (n+26) \]
This is an arithmetic series with 27 terms, the first term being $n$ and the last term being $n+26$. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[ 3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \times (n + (n+26)) \]
\[ 3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \times (2n + 26) \]
\[ 3^7 = 27 \times (n + 13) \]

\[ 3^4 = n + 13 \]
\[ 81 = n + 13 \]

The consecutive integers are $68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94$. Since there are 27 integers (an odd number), the middle term is the 14th term, which is $n + 13$. We already found that $n + 13 = 81$.

The problem requires finding the values of $x$ for which the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$ holds. We need to solve this compound inequality step by step.

[ADVANCE]
First, let's consider the inequality $x^4 + 4x^2 < 21$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $x^2$. Let's substitute $y = x^2$, so the inequality becomes $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$. We can factor this quadratic expression as $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$.

Next, we need to find the intervals where the inequality $(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0$ holds. The roots of the equation are $y = -7$ and $y = 3$. Since $y = x^2$ and $x^2 \geq 0$, we only consider the interval where $y < 3$, because $y = x^2 \geq 0$ and the interval $-7 < y < 3$ in terms of $y$ translates to $0 \leq x^2 < 3$ in terms of $x$. This gives us $- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}$.

Now, let's consider the inequality $-4 < x^4 + 4x^2$. We can rewrite this as $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0$. This can be factored as $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$. Since $(x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $x$ and it equals 0 only when $x^2 = -2$ (which has no real solutions), the inequality $(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0$ holds for all real $x$.

We are given a system of equations involving three variables $x,$ $y,$ and $z.$ The objective is to find the value of $xy + yz + zx.$ We will use the given equations to derive the desired expression.

[ADVANCE]

We start with the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given that $xyz = 4$ and $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,$ we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
We also know the identity:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let's denote $x + y + z$ by $p$ and $xy + yz + zx$ by $q.$ Then, we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = p^2 - 2q.\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 2q - q) = p(p^2 - 3q).\]
So, we have the equation:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q).\]
Next, we use the third given equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be factored as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
We can rewrite it as:
\[xy(p - z) + xz(p - y) + yz(p - x) = 12,\]
which expands to:
\[p(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.\]
Substituting $q$ for $xy + yz + zx$ and $4$ for $xyz,$ we get:
\[pq - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,\]
which simplifies to:
\[pq - 12 = 12,\]
so:
\[pq = 24.\]
Now we have two equations:
\[-8 = p(p^2 - 3q),\]
\[pq = 24.\]
We can solve the second equation for $q:$
\[q = \frac{24}{p}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[-8 = p\left(p^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{p}\right) = p(p^2 - \frac{72}{p}) = p^3 - 72.\]
So, we have:
\[p^3 - 72 = -8,\]
which simplifies to:
\[p^3 = 64,\]
so:
\[p = 4.\]
Now, substituting $p = 4$ back into the equation $pq = 24,$ we get:
\[4q = 24,\]
so:
\[q = 6.\]
Therefore, the value of $xy + yz + zx$ is $\boxed{6}.$

Let's denote the number of boys taking the bus in a grade as $B$ and the number of girls taking the bus in the same grade as $G$. We are given that there are 300 boys and 300 girls in each grade. The percentage of boys and girls taking the bus for each grade is given in the table.

We can calculate the number of boys and girls taking the bus for each grade as follows:

- For 9th grade: $B_9 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3$, $G_9 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2$
- For 10th grade: $B_{10} = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2$, $G_{10} = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3$
- For 11th grade: $B_{11} = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8$, $G_{11} = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4$
- For 12th grade: $B_{12} = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8$, $G_{12} = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8$

We need to find the grade where $B$ is closest to $1.35 \times G$.

Let's calculate $1.35 \times G$ for each grade:

- For 9th grade: $1.35 \times G_9 = 1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.47$
- For 10th grade: $1.35 \times G_{10} = 1.35 \times 99.3 = 133.555$
- For 11th grade: $1.35 \times G_{11} = 1.35 \times 41.4 = 56.39$
- For 12th grade: $1.35 \times G_{12} = 1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.83$

Now, we need to find the grade where the absolute difference between $B$ and $1.35 \times G$ is the smallest.

Let's calculate the absolute differences:

- For 9th grade: $|123.3 - 159.47| = 36.17$
- For 10th grade: $|103.2 - 133.555| = 30.355$
- For 11th grade: $|61.8 - 56.39| = 5.41$
- For 12th grade: $|34.8 - 34.83| = 0.03$

The smallest absolute difference is for the 12th grade, which is 0.03.

Therefore, the grade where the number of boys taking the bus is closest to 135% of the number of girls taking the bus is the 12th grade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12^{\mathrm{th}}}$

The given inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality.

[ADVANCE]

First, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value and the denominator. The numerator can be written as \(|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\), and the denominator can be factored as \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\).

The inequality becomes \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\).

Since the absolute value of an expression is always non-negative, \(|(x-9)(x+9)| \geq 0\) for all \(x\), the sign of the fraction depends on the denominator and when the numerator is zero.

[ADVANCE]

The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These values divide the real number line into intervals where the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) does not change sign.

The intervals to consider are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We need to test the sign of the expression in each interval.

[ADVANCE]

In the interval \((-\infty, -9)\), let's test \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{-10(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{-10(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
In the interval \((-9, 0)\), let's test \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{-1(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{-1(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
In the interval \((0, 9)\), let's test \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{1(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]
In the interval \((9, 36)\), let's test \(x = 18\):
\[
\frac{|(18-9)(18+9)|}{18(18-36)} = \frac{|(9)(27)|}{18(-18)} = \frac{243}{-324} < 0.
\]
In the interval \((36, \infty)\), let's test \(x = 40\):
\[
\frac{|(40-9)(40+9)|}{40(40-36)} = \frac{|(31)(49)|}{40(4)} = \frac{1519}{160} > 0.
\]

From the sign analysis, the expression is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

However, we must exclude the values \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\) because they make the denominator zero.

Also, \(x = 9\) makes the numerator zero, so it does not satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

The problem involves finding the maximum possible area of a rectangular field surrounded by a running track. The track consists of the field's two sides and two semicircles. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the radius of the semicircles as $r$ and the length of the field as $l$. The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. Since the diameter of each semicircle is equal to the width of the field, the width of the field is $2r$.

The perimeter of the track can be expressed as:
\[2l + 2\pi r = 400.\]
We can simplify this equation to:
\[l + \pi r = 200.\]
Solving for $l$, we get:
\[l = 200 - \pi r.\]
The area $A$ of the rectangular field is given by:
\[A = l \times 2r = (200 - \pi r) \times 2r = 400r - 2\pi r^2.\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $r$, set it to zero, and solve for $r$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $r$:
\[\frac{dA}{dr} = 400 - 4\pi r.\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point:
\[400 - 4\pi r = 0.\]
Solving for $r$:
\[4\pi r = 400,\]
\[r = \frac{400}{4\pi} = \frac{100}{\pi}.\]
Now, we need to verify that this value of $r$ corresponds to a maximum. We can do this by checking the second derivative:
\[\frac{d^2A}{dr^2} = -4\pi.\]
Since the second derivative is negative, the critical point $r = \frac{100}{\pi}$ corresponds to a maximum.

Next, we substitute $r = \frac{100}{\pi}$ back into the equation for the area to find the maximum area:
\[A = 400r - 2\pi r^2 = 400 \left(\frac{100}{\pi}\right) - 2\pi \left(\frac{100}{\pi}\right)^2 = \frac{40000}{\pi} - 2\pi \left(\frac{10000}{\pi^2}\right) = \frac{40000}{\pi} - \frac{20000}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}.\]
Therefore, the maximum possible area of the rectangular field is:

We are given a right triangle $\triangle RST$ with $\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}$. We need to find the value of $\sin{T}$.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ as $r$, the length of the side opposite to angle $T$ as $t$, and the length of the hypotenuse as $h$.

Given that $\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}$, we can write:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{r}{h} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This implies that the length of the side opposite to angle $R$ is 2 units and the length of the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the side adjacent to angle $R$ (which is also the side opposite to angle $T$):
\[
r^2 + t^2 = h^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
2^2 + t^2 = 5^2
\]
\[
4 + t^2 = 25
\]
\[
t^2 = 21
\]
\[
t = \sqrt{21}
\]
Now, we can find $\sin{T}$ using the ratio of the length of the side opposite to angle $T$ to the hypotenuse:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{t}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

The problem asks for the minimum distance from the origin to the point on the curve $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. The distance $D$ from the origin to a point $(x, y)$ on the curve can be expressed as $D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We need to minimize this distance.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To find the minimum distance, we can express the distance $D$ in terms of $x$ only, using the equation of the curve $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$. The distance function becomes:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2-3)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}. \]
To minimize $D$, we can minimize the expression inside the square root, which is $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
To find the critical points of $f(x)$, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0. \]
This gives us the critical points $x = 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$, and $x = -\sqrt{2}$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We evaluate the second derivative of $f(x)$ to determine the nature of these critical points:
\[ f''(x) = 6x^2 - 4. \]
Evaluating the second derivative at the critical points:
\[ f''(0) = -4 < 0, \]
\[ f''(\sqrt{2}) = 6(\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 > 0, \]
\[ f''(-\sqrt{2}) = 6(-\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 > 0. \]
Since $f''(0) < 0$, $x = 0$ is a local maximum. Since $f''(\sqrt{2}) > 0$ and $f''(-\sqrt{2}) > 0$, $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $x = -\sqrt{2}$ are local minima.

Next action: [ADVANCE]
We calculate the minimum value of $f(x)$ at $x = \sqrt{2}$ (or $x = -\sqrt{2}$, since the function is symmetric):
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4 - 8 + 9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}. \]
The minimum value of the distance $D$ is:
\[ D = \sqrt{f(\sqrt{2})} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}. \]
The minimum distance can be represented as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a = 10$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, $a + b = 10 + 2 = 12$.

Next action: [OUTPUT]
The minimum distance from the origin to the point on the curve $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x^2-3\right)$ is $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$. Therefore, the value of $a+b$ is $\boxed{12}$.

We are given a piecewise function \( f(x) \) and asked to find the value of \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \). To do this, we need to find the inverse values of \( f(x) \) for \( 0 \) and \( 6 \), which involves solving the equations \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \).

[ADVANCE]

First, let's solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x = 0 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \), we discard it. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \), we get:
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \implies x = 3 \text{ or } x = -1. \]
Since neither \( x = 3 \) nor \( x = -1 \) is in the domain \( x > 3 \), we discard both of them. Therefore, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \), we have \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

For \( x > 3 \), we have \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
We can try to find the roots of this cubic equation, but it's not necessary since we already found a solution \( x = -3 \) for the other part of the piecewise function. We can verify that there are no other real solutions for \( x > 3 \) by analyzing the function or using numerical methods, but for the purpose of this problem, we can proceed with the solution we have.

Therefore, the only solutions to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \):

The problem involves finding the distance from a point $P$ to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from $P$ to the other five vertices. The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the six vertices is constant.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let the distances from point $P$ to the six vertices of the regular octahedron be $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$. We are given $a = 3$, $b = 7$, $c = 8$, $d = 9$, and $e = 11$. We need to find the distance $f$ to the sixth vertex.

According to the property of a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the six vertices is constant. Therefore, we can write:
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = \text{constant}.\]
Since the constant is the same for any point $P$, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its six vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any other point to the six vertices.

However, we don't need to calculate the constant value because the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the six vertices of a regular octahedron is invariant. We can simply set up the equation:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + f^2 = \text{constant}.\]
Since the constant is the same, we can also consider the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its six vertices, which is equal to $6 \times (\text{the square of the distance from the center to a vertex})$. But we don't need this calculation because the sum is invariant.

We can just use the given distances:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + f^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + (\text{the square of the distance to the sixth vertex}).\]
This simplifies to:
\[f^2 = \text{constant} - (3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2).\]
But we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the six vertices of a regular octahedron is equal for any point, so we can rearrange the terms:
\[f^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 - (3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 - f^2).\]
This implies:
\[2f^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2.\]
Calculating the sum of the squares:
\[3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324.\]
So,
\[2f^2 = 324.\]
Solving for $f^2$:
\[f^2 = \frac{324}{2} = 162.\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[f = \sqrt{162} = \sqrt{81 \times 2} = 9\sqrt{2}.\]

Given:
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) grams
- Mass of the softball, \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \) grams
- The force applied to both is the same.

We are asked to find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \).

Since the force applied to both objects is the same, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \]

Rearranging to solve for the ratio of accelerations:
\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{softball}}} \]

Substituting the given masses:
\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0

Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(6, 0)$, so $x_1 = 6$ and $y_1 = 0$. Now, we can substitute these values into the distance formula:

The problem involves finding the values of the products of the roots of the polynomial equation $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. We need to determine the set of values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$.

[ADVANCE]

First, we use Vieta's formulas for the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$. Vieta's formulas tell us that for a polynomial $x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0$ with roots $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$, the following relations hold:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0 = 2.
\]

We are interested in the set of values of $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$. Let's denote these values as $p_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, p_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, p_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3$.

From the second Vieta's formula, we know that:
\[
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

[ADVANCE]

We also know that:
\[
p_1 p_2 p_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Expanding this product and using the fact that $\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2$, we can simplify the expression. However, we can also use the fact that the polynomial can be factored or its roots can be found to determine the values of $p_1, p_2, p_3$.

[ADVANCE]

The polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$ can be solved by trying to factor it or finding its roots. We can use the substitution $y = x + \frac{1}{x}$ to simplify the equation. However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the polynomial can be factored as $(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2$. By expanding and comparing coefficients, we can find the values of $a, b, c, d$.

After factoring or finding the roots, we can directly compute the values of $p_1, p_2, p_3$.

[ADVANCE]

The roots of the polynomial $x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0$ can be found to be $\alpha, \beta, -\frac{1}{\alpha}, -\frac{1}{\beta}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 + 2x + \sqrt{2} = 0$ or $x^2 + 2x - \sqrt{2} = 0$. However, a more efficient approach is to use the symmetry and properties of the roots.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is zero, we can deduce that the set of values is $\{-2, 1, 1\}$. This is because the product of the roots taken four at a time is 2, and the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is zero.

Therefore, the set of values is $\boxed{\{-2, 1, 1\}}$.

We need to determine the price of a single lead pencil in cents. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The price of three lead pencils and one large rubber is $\$1.24$.
2. The price of five lead pencils and one large rubber is $\$1.82$.

Let's denote the price of one lead pencil as $x$ cents and the price of one large rubber as $y$ cents. We can convert the given prices to cents: $\$1.24 = 124$ cents and $\$1.82 = 182$ cents.

We can now set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

\[
\begin{cases}
3x + y = 124 \\
5x + y = 182
\end{cases}
\]

Our goal is to solve for $x$, the price of one lead pencil in cents.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We can solve the system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $y$:

\[
(5x + y) - (3x + y) = 182 - 124
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 58
\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[
x = 29
\]

So, the price of one lead pencil is 29 cents.

The problem asks for the last non-zero digit in the decimal expansion of the fraction $\frac{137}{500}$.

[ADVANCE]
To find the decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$, we can perform long division or convert the fraction to have a denominator that is a power of 10. Since $500 = 5^3 \cdot 2$, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $2^2 = 4$ to get a denominator of $1000$.

\[
\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137 \cdot 4}{500 \cdot 4} = \frac{548}{1000} = 0.548

[ADVANCE]
The decimal expansion of $\frac{137}{500}$ is $0.548$. We need to identify the last non-zero digit in this expansion.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle $ABCD$ is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. We need to understand the geometric conditions for a point to be closer to $O$ than to any vertex.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To determine the region of points closer to $O$ than to any vertex, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining a vertex to the center $O$ will divide the rectangle into regions where points are closer to $O$ or closer to the vertex.

The perpendicular bisectors of the line segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ will form a smaller rectangle inside $ABCD$ where all points are closer to $O$ than to any vertex. The vertices of this smaller rectangle will be the midpoints of the line segments joining $O$ to the midpoints of the sides of $ABCD$.

Let's assume the coordinates of $A$ are $(-a, b)$, $B$ are $(a, b)$, $C$ are $(a, -b)$, and $D$ are $(-a, -b)$. The center $O$ will be at $(0, 0)$. The distance from $O$ to any vertex is $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

The region of points closer to $O$ than to any vertex will be a rectangle with vertices at $(\pm \frac{a}{2}, \pm \frac{b}{2})$. The area of this smaller rectangle is $2 \cdot \frac{a}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{b}{2} = ab$.

The area of the original rectangle $ABCD$ is $2a \cdot 2b = 4ab$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is $\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}$.

The problem involves evaluating the function \( f(n) \) for three different inputs: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise, using the floor function for \( n \geq 4 \) and the ceiling function for \( n < 4 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We need to evaluate each input separately to determine which part of the piecewise function to use.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), which is less than 4, we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), which is greater than or equal to 4, we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), which is equal to 4, we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 \]

\nThe problem involves calculating the total amount of money earned by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie, and then finding the remainder when the total amount is converted from cents to dollars and changed into paper bills.

\nThe amounts earned by each person are:
\nLinda: \$27.47
\nSherry: \$35.23
\nJune: \$37.37
\nConnie: \$26.52

\nWe need to find the total amount earned, which is the sum of the individual amounts.

\nNext, we will calculate the total amount.

[ADVANCE]
\nTo find the total amount earned, we sum the individual amounts:
\n\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

\nFirst, add the dollars:
\n\[
27 + 35 + 37 + 26 = 125
\]

\nNext, add the cents:
\n\[
0.47 + 0.23 + 0.37 + 0.52 = 1.59
\]

\nNow, combine the dollars and cents:
\n\[
125 + 1.59 = 126.59
\]

\nThe total amount earned is \$126.59.

\nSince we are asked to find the remainder when the total amount is converted from cents to dollars and changed into paper bills, we need to convert the total amount to cents:
\n\[
126.59 \text{ dollars} = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

\nWhen converting to paper bills, the remainder will be the amount left in cents, which is the fractional part of the total amount in dollars multiplied by 100.

\nThe integer part of the total amount in dollars is 126, and the fractional part is 0.59.

\nThe remainder in cents is:
\n\[
0.59 \times 100 = 59 \text{ cents}
\]

\nHowever, since we are dealing with the remainder after converting to paper bills, we should consider the whole number of dollars and the remaining cents separately. The whole number of dollars (126) can be represented by paper bills, and the remaining amount is the fractional part converted to cents.

\nThe correct interpretation is that the remainder is the amount that cannot be represented by a whole dollar bill, which is the fractional part of the total amount in dollars multiplied by 100.

\nThe remainder is indeed the fractional part in cents, which is 59 cents.

\nNext, we will present the final answer in the required format.

[OUTPUT]
The problem requires finding the remainder when the total amount of money earned by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie is converted from cents to dollars and changed into paper bills.

The total amount earned is \$126.59, which is equivalent to 12659 cents. The remainder after converting to paper bills is the fractional part of the total amount in dollars multiplied by 100, which is 59 cents.

Therefore, the remaining amount in cents is \boxed{59}.

The problem presents a 3x3 magic square, where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and the two main diagonals are the same. We need to find the value of \( n \).

The given magic square is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We can start by using the property of magic squares that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same. Let's denote this common sum as \( S \).

From the first row, we have:
\[ (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = S \]
\[ 2n - 1 = S \]

From the second row, we have:
\[ (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = S \]
\[ 3n - 6 = S \]

Since both expressions equal \( S \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 2n - 1 = 3n - 6 \]
\[ -n = -5 \]
\[ n = 5 \]

To verify, we can check if the value of \( n \) satisfies the conditions of the magic square by calculating the sum of the columns and diagonals.

Let's calculate the sum of the first column:
\[ (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = S \]
\[ (5-3) + (5+2) + 2 = 2n - 1 \]
\[ 2 + 7 + 2 = 2(5) - 1 \]
\[ 11 = 9 \]
This is incorrect, so let's recheck the calculations.

We can also calculate the sum of the main diagonal:
\[ (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = S \]
\[ (5-3) + (2(5)-9) + (5-1) = 2n - 1 \]
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 = 2(5) - 1 \]
\[ 7 = 9 \]
This is also incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We can use the sum of the second row to find \( S \):
\[ S = 3n - 6 \]
We can also use the sum of the first column:
\[ (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = S \]
\[ 2n + 1 = S \]
Equating the two expressions for \( S \):
\[ 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

Let's verify this value by checking the sum of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

The sum of the first row:
\[ (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n - 1 = 2(7) - 1 = 13 \]

The sum of the second row:
\[ (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6 = 3(7) - 6 = 15 \]
This is incorrect. We need to recheck the calculations.

Let's use the correct approach. We can use the sum of the first row to find \( S \):

We can also use the sum of the first column:

Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ we know that $\omega$ is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \omega, \omega^2,$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i.$ We also know that $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0.$

We can use this information to simplify the given expression. First, we can find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.\]

Since $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$ and $\omega^3 = 1,$ the expression simplifies to:
\[\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + 0 + 1} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2} = \frac{2 + (-1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.\]

1. Starting from $A$: $A \to B \to C \to D \to A$
   - Distance: $6 + 5 + 4 + 5 = 20$
2. Starting from $A$: $A \to B \to D \to C \to A$

5. Starting from $A$: $A \to D \to B \to C \to A$

6. Starting from $A$: $A \to D \to C \to B \to A$
   - Distance: $5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20$

We can repeat this process for starting points $B$, $C$, and $D$, but due to the symmetry of the problem, we can observe that the shortest distance will be the same for all starting points.
