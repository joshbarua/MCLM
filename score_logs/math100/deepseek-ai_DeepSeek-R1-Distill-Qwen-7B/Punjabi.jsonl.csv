"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the length of DE. The diagram shows a right triangle with points D, E, and F. They've given me that sin D is 0.7, and there's a segment EF labeled as 7. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me recall what sin D means. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse. So, if angle D is one of the non-right angles, then sin D = opposite side / hypotenuse. 

Looking at the Asymptote code, it defines points D, E, and F. F is at (0,0), which is the origin. D is at (sqrt(51),7), and E is at (0,7). So, drawing this out, F is the right angle because the right angle mark is at E, between D, E, and F. Wait, no, the right angle is at E, so the right angle is between D-E-F. So, triangle DEF is a right triangle with the right angle at E.

Wait, hold on, the right angle is at E, so DE and EF are the legs, and DF is the hypotenuse. So, DE is one leg, EF is another leg, and DF is the hypotenuse.

They've given that EF is 7, which is one of the legs. So, EF = 7. Now, sin D is 0.7. Let me figure out which sides correspond to angle D.

In triangle DEF, angle D is at point D. So, the sides relative to angle D are: the opposite side is EF, and the hypotenuse is DF. So, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = EF / DF. They've given sin D = 0.7, so 0.7 = 7 / DF. 

So, if I solve for DF, I can rearrange that equation. DF = 7 / 0.7. Let me compute that. 7 divided by 0.7 is the same as 7 divided by 7/10, which is 7 * (10/7) = 10. So, DF is 10 units long.

Now, I need to find DE. DE is the other leg of the right triangle. I know that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. So, DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2.

We know EF is 7, DF is 10, so plugging in the values: DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2. That simplifies to DE^2 + 49 = 100. Subtracting 49 from both sides, DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51. Therefore, DE is the square root of 51.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, sin D is opposite over hypotenuse, which is EF / DF. EF is 7, DF is 10, so 7/10 is 0.7, which matches the given sin D. Then, using Pythagoras, DE^2 = DF^2 - EF^2 = 100 - 49 = 51, so DE is sqrt(51). That seems right.

Just to make sure I didn't mix up the sides, let me confirm the labels. Point D is at (sqrt(51),7), E is at (0,7), and F is at (0,0). So, DE is the horizontal line from E to D, which would be sqrt(51) units long, right? Because the x-coordinate of D is sqrt(51), and E is at (0,7), so the distance between them is just the difference in the x-coordinates, which is sqrt(51) - 0 = sqrt(51). So, DE is indeed sqrt(51).

Wait, but in the triangle, DE is one leg, EF is another leg, and DF is the hypotenuse. So, DE is sqrt(51), EF is 7, and DF is 10. Let me check if sqrt(51)^2 + 7^2 equals 10^2. sqrt(51)^2 is 51, 7^2 is 49, so 51 + 49 is 100, which is 10^2. Perfect, that checks out.

So, everything seems consistent. I think I've got it right. DE is sqrt(51). I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be sqrt(51).

**Final Answer**
The length of $DE$ is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.
</think>

Given that $\sin D = 0.7$ in the right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we need to find the length of DE. 

First, we recognize that $\sin D$ is the ratio of the length of the opposite side (EF) to the hypotenuse (DF). Since $\sin D = 0.7$, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Given that EF = 7, we can solve for DF:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF} \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find DE. The theorem states that:
\[
DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2 \implies DE^2 + 49 = 100 \implies DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Thus, the length of DE is:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

The length of $DE$ is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number \( w \) by rotating another complex number \( z \) around a point \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians in the counterclockwise direction. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the given complex numbers. The complex number \( z \) is given as \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. Is it \( (2 + \sqrt{2}) - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)? Yeah, that makes sense. So, in terms of real and imaginary parts, \( z \) can be written as \( a + bi \), where \( a = 2 + \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = -(3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \). So, \( z = (2 + \sqrt{2}) - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \).

Then, the complex number \( c \) is given as \( 2 - 3i \). So, in terms of real and imaginary parts, \( c = 2 - 3i \), meaning \( a = 2 \) and \( b = -3 \).

Now, the task is to find \( w \) such that when \( z \) is rotated around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we get \( w \). 

I remember that rotating a complex number around another point involves translating the complex plane so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. So, the steps should be:

1. Translate \( z \) by subtracting \( c \). This moves the center of rotation \( c \) to the origin.
2. Rotate the translated point by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise.
3. Translate the result back by adding \( c \).

Let me write this down mathematically. If \( T \) represents translation, then:

\( w = T^{-1}_{c} \left( R_{\frac{\pi}{4}} (T_{c}(z)) \right) \)

Where \( T_{c}(z) = z - c \) is the translation of \( z \) by \( c \), and \( R_{\theta} \) represents rotation by \( \theta \) radians.

So, first, let's compute \( T_{c}(z) = z - c \).

Given \( z = (2 + \sqrt{2}) - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):

\( z - c = [ (2 + \sqrt{2}) - 2 ] + [ - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (-3) ]i \)

Simplify the real part: \( (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) = \sqrt{2} \)

Simplify the imaginary part: \( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) + 3 = -3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3 = -3\sqrt{2} \)

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Let me write that as \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \). Hmm, that might be useful later.

Now, the next step is to rotate this translated point \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise. I know that rotation in the complex plane can be achieved by multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the angle of rotation. So, for \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), the rotation factor is \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \).

Calculating that, \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). So, \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Therefore, the rotated point is:

\( R_{\frac{\pi}{4}}(z - c) = (z - c) \times e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \)

Substituting the values we have:

\( R_{\frac{\pi}{4}}(z - c) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Let me compute this multiplication step by step. Let me denote \( A = \sqrt{2} \) and \( B = -3\sqrt{2}i \), so the expression becomes \( (A + B) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \).

Multiplying out:

\( A \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + A \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + B \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + B \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Let me compute each term:

1. \( A \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)
2. \( A \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)
3. \( B \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (-3\sqrt{2}i) \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)
4. \( B \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (-3\sqrt{2}i) \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2} \times i^2 = -3 \times 1 \times (-1) = 3 \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Now, adding all these terms together:

1. 1 (from term 1)
2. + i (from term 2)
3. -3i (from term 3)
4. + 3 (from term 4)

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 1 + 3 = 4

Imaginary parts: i - 3i = -2i

So, the result of the rotation is \( 4 - 2i \).

Now, the last step is to translate this back by adding \( c \). Remember, \( c = 2 - 3i \).

So, \( w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) \)

Adding the real parts: 4 + 2 = 6

Adding the imaginary parts: -2i - 3i = -5i

Therefore, \( w = 6 - 5i \).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Then, multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Multiplying \( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \):

First term: \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Second term: \( \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Third term: \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)

Fourth term: \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2} \times i^2 = -3 \times (-1) = 3 \)

Adding them up: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i. That seems correct.

Then, adding \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 - 5i \). That also seems correct.

So, \( w = 6 - 5i \).

Wait, but let me think again. The Asymptote code in the problem draws the points Z, C, and W, with W being the rotated point. The code is:

```asy
pair C, W, Z;

Z = (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2));
C = (2,-3);
W = rotate(45,C)*(Z);

draw(Z--C--W);
```

So, in the Asymptote code, Z is defined as (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2)). Wait, hold on, in the problem statement, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \). So, in terms of coordinates, that would be (2 + sqrt(2), -(3 + 3sqrt(2))). But in the Asymptote code, Z is (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2)). Wait, that's the same as (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3sqrt(2)), which is the same as (Re(z), Im(z)) because Im(z) is - (3 + 3sqrt(2)).

Similarly, C is (2, -3), which is consistent with c = 2 - 3i.

So, the Asymptote code is correct. Then, W is computed as rotate(45,C)*(Z). So, in Asymptote, the rotate function rotates the point Z around point C by 45 degrees, which is consistent with our problem.

So, the Asymptote code is consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, my calculation should be correct.

But just to be thorough, let me verify the rotation again.

We had \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Then, multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} \) gives 4 - 2i, then adding c gives 6 - 5i.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent \( z - c \) in polar form and then add the angle \( \pi/4 \) to it.

Let me try that approach.

First, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Let me find its magnitude and argument.

Magnitude: \( |z - c| = \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 9 \times 2} = \sqrt{2 + 18} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \).

Argument: \( \theta = \arctan\left( \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \arctan(-3) \). Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, the point is in the fourth quadrant. So, the argument is \( -\arctan(3) \).

So, \( z - c \) can be written in polar form as \( 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos(-\arctan(3)) + i \sin(-\arctan(3)) \right) \).

When we rotate this by \( \pi/4 \), the new argument becomes \( -\arctan(3) + \pi/4 \).

So, the rotated point is \( 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos(-\arctan(3) + \pi/4) + i \sin(-\arctan(3) + \pi/4) \right) \).

Then, adding \( c \) back, which is 2 - 3i, we get \( w \).

But this seems more complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with the algebraic method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the rotation as a matrix multiplication.

In complex numbers, rotation can be represented as multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} \), which is equivalent to the rotation matrix:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}
\]

So, if I have a complex number \( a + bi \), represented as a vector \( \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), then multiplying by the rotation matrix gives the rotated vector.

So, let's try that.

Given \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \), which is the vector \( \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{2} \\ -3\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \).

The rotation matrix for \( \pi/4 \) is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\pi/4) & -\sin(\pi/4) \\
\sin(\pi/4) & \cos(\pi/4)
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

"I need to simplify the square root of 242. To do this, I'll start by factoring 242 into its prime factors.

First, I'll divide 242 by 2, which gives me 121. So, 242 can be expressed as 2 multiplied by 121.

Next, I recognize that 121 is a perfect square because 11 multiplied by 11 equals 121.

Now, I'll rewrite the square root of 242 using these factors: √(2 × 11²).

Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, this becomes √2 × √11².

The square root of 11 squared is simply 11, so the expression simplifies to 11√2.

"Alright, let's try to figure out how 8 people can sit around a maze made of two circles connected by a bridge, with the condition that three specific people—Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas—must all sit together. 

First, I need to visualize the maze. It's two separate circles connected by a bridge, so there are two separate groups of people who can't interact except through the bridge. But since the bridge is a single point, maybe the two circles are connected in a way that allows movement between them, but each circle is a separate entity.

Now, the main challenge is that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must all sit together. Since the maze has two circles, I'm thinking that they can't all be in the same circle because the circles are separate. So, they must be split between the two circles. But wait, the problem says that each circle is a separate group, so maybe they can't all be in one circle because they have to be together. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the maze is structured in such a way that the two circles are connected, allowing people to move between them, but each circle is a separate entity. So, perhaps the two circles are like two separate rooms connected by a door, and the bridge is the door. In that case, people can move between the two circles, but each circle is a separate group.

But the problem says that each circle is a separate group, so maybe the two circles are like two separate rooms, and the bridge is a single point where they connect. So, if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all in one circle, they can't be in the other. But the problem says they must all sit together, which might mean they have to be in the same circle. But the maze has two circles, so maybe they can be split between the two circles, but that would mean they aren't all together.

Wait, maybe the maze is a single connected structure where the two circles are connected by a bridge, allowing people to move between them, but each circle is a separate group. So, perhaps the two circles are like two separate rooms connected by a bridge, but each room is a separate group. So, if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all in one room, they can't be in the other. But the problem says they must all sit together, which might mean they have to be in the same room. But the maze has two rooms, so maybe they can be split between the two rooms, but that would mean they aren't all together.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The maze has two circles, so there are two separate groups of people. Each group can have a certain number of people. The total number of people is 8, and three of them must sit together. So, maybe the three of them can be in one circle, and the remaining five in the other. But the problem says that each circle is a separate group, so maybe the three can't all be in the same circle because they have to be together, but the maze allows them to be in separate circles as long as they are together in some way.

Wait, maybe the maze is a single connected structure where the two circles are connected by a bridge, allowing people to move between them, but each circle is a separate group. So, perhaps the three of them can be in one circle, and the other five in the other circle.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about it differently. Let's consider that the maze is a single connected structure with two circles connected by a bridge. So, the total number of seats is 8, with two circles. Each circle has a certain number of seats. The three people must sit together, so they can be in one circle or split between the two circles. But if they are split, they wouldn't all be together, which violates the condition.

Wait, maybe the three can be in one circle, and the other five in the other circle. But the problem says that each circle is a separate group, so maybe the three can't all be in the same circle because they have to be together, but the maze allows them to be in separate circles as long as they are together in some way.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to calculate the number of ways they can sit together. If the three are in one circle, then the number of ways to arrange them is 3! ways, and the remaining five can be arranged in the other circle. But I'm not sure how the circles are structured. Maybe each circle has four seats, so two circles of four seats each.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify how many seats are in each circle, just that there are two circles. So, maybe each circle has four seats. So, if the three must sit together, they can be in one circle, taking up three seats, and the fourth seat can be occupied by someone else. But then the other five would have to be split between the two circles, which might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe the three can be split between the two circles, but that would mean they aren't all together, which violates the condition. So, perhaps the only way is to have all three in one circle, and the remaining five in the other circle. But then, the circle with three people would have four seats, so one seat would be empty. But the problem doesn't specify that all seats must be occupied, just that the three must sit together.

Wait, the problem says ""8 ਲੋਕ ਗੋਲ ਮੇਜ਼ ਦੇ ਆਲੇ ਦੁਆਲੇ ਕਿੰਨੇ ਤਰੀਕਿਆਂ ਨਾਲ ਬੈਠ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ"", which translates to ""In how many ways can 8 people sit in the maze made of two circles connected by a bridge, with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must all sit together.""

So, the maze has two circles connected by a bridge, and each circle is a separate group. So, the two circles are like two separate rooms connected by a bridge, but each room is a separate group. So, the three must sit together in one of the circles, and the remaining five in the other circle.

So, the number of ways would be: first, choose which circle the three will sit in. There are two choices: circle A or circle B. Then, arrange the three people in that circle: 3! ways. Then, arrange the remaining five people in the other circle: 5! ways. So, total ways would be 2 * 3! * 5! = 2 * 6 * 120 = 1440 ways.

But wait, maybe the circles are of different sizes. If circle A has, say, 4 seats and circle B has 4 seats, then the three can sit in circle A or circle B. So, the calculation would be 2 * 3! * 5! = 1440.

Alternatively, if the circles are of different sizes, say circle A has 5 seats and circle B has 3 seats, but that would make it impossible to seat all 8 people, so probably each circle has 4 seats.

So, the answer would be 2 * 3! * 5! = 1440 ways.

"Okay, so I have this algebra problem here: I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like this, you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that \((a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\). So in this case, \(a\) is \(10x^3\), \(b\) is \(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n\) is 5.

So, the expansion will be the sum from \(k = 0\) to \(k = 5\) of \(\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero because that's the constant term.

Let me write out the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \cdot (10x^3)^{5 - k} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplify each part step by step. First, let's handle the constants and the coefficients.

The coefficient part is \(\binom{5}{k} \cdot 10^{5 - k} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\). Let me write that as:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \cdot 10^{5 - k} \cdot (-1)^k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k
\]

Which can be combined as:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \cdot 10^{5 - k} \cdot (-1)^k \cdot 2^{-k}
\]

Simplify \(10^{5 - k} \cdot 2^{-k}\). Since \(10 = 2 \cdot 5\), so \(10^{5 - k} = 2^{5 - k} \cdot 5^{5 - k}\). Therefore, multiplying by \(2^{-k}\) gives:

\[
2^{5 - k} \cdot 5^{5 - k} \cdot 2^{-k} = 2^{5 - 2k} \cdot 5^{5 - k}
\]

So the coefficient becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \cdot (-1)^k \cdot 2^{5 - 2k} \cdot 5^{5 - k}
\]

Now, let's handle the variable part. The term has \(x^{3(5 - k)}\) from \((10x^3)^{5 - k}\) and \(x^{-2k}\) from \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\). So combining these exponents:

\[
x^{3(5 - k) - 2k} = x^{15 - 3k - 2k} = x^{15 - 5k}
\]

We need the exponent of \(x\) to be zero for the constant term. So set \(15 - 5k = 0\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies 5k = 15 \implies k = 3
\]

So the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Now, let's compute the coefficient for \(k = 3\).

First, compute the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{3}\). I remember that \(\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10\).

Next, compute the constants:

- \(10^{5 - 3} = 10^2 = 100\)
- \((-1)^3 = -1\)
- \(2^{5 - 2 \cdot 3} = 2^{5 - 6} = 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(5^{5 - 3} = 5^2 = 25\)

Multiply all these together with the binomial coefficient:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 25
\]

Let me compute step by step:

1. \(10 \cdot 100 = 1000\)
2. \(1000 \cdot (-1) = -1000\)
3. \(-1000 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -500\)
4. \(-500 \cdot 25 = -12,500\)

Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in combining the exponents or the coefficients. Let me go back.

Starting from the coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^{2} \cdot (-1)^3 \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot 5^{2}
\]

So that's:

10 * 100 * (-1) * (1/2) * 25

Compute 10 * 100 first: 1000

1000 * (-1) = -1000

-1000 * (1/2) = -500

-500 * 25 = -12,500

Hmm, that seems correct. So the constant term is -12,500.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I messed up the exponents somewhere.

Wait, 10^{5 - k} is 10^{2} when k=3, which is 100. Then 2^{-k} is 2^{-3} = 1/8? Wait, no, earlier I thought 2^{5 - 2k} when combining 10^{5 - k} and 2^{-k}.

Wait, let me re-examine that step.

We had:

10^{5 - k} * 2^{-k} = (2*5)^{5 - k} * 2^{-k} = 2^{5 - k} * 5^{5 - k} * 2^{-k} = 2^{5 - 2k} * 5^{5 - k}

So for k=3, that's 2^{5 - 6} * 5^{2} = 2^{-1} * 25 = (1/2)*25 = 12.5

Then, the coefficient is:

binom(5,3) * (-1)^3 * 12.5

Which is 10 * (-1) * 12.5 = -125

Wait, that's different from -12,500. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I messed up the earlier step when I combined 10^{5 - k} and 2^{-k}.

Wait, 10^{5 - k} is (2*5)^{5 - k} = 2^{5 - k} * 5^{5 - k}

Then, multiplying by 2^{-k} gives 2^{5 - k - k} * 5^{5 - k} = 2^{5 - 2k} * 5^{5 - k}

So, for k=3, 2^{5 - 6} * 5^{2} = 2^{-1} * 25 = 12.5

So, the coefficient is binom(5,3) * (-1)^3 * 12.5

Which is 10 * (-1) * 12.5 = -125

Wait, so earlier I thought 10^{5 - k} * 2^{-k} was 2^{5 - 2k} * 5^{5 - k}, which is correct, but when I computed 10^{5 - 3} * 2^{-3}, that's 100 * (1/8) = 12.5, which is the same as 2^{-1} * 25.

So, the coefficient is 10 * (-1)^3 * 12.5 = -125

Wait, so why did I get -12,500 earlier? Because I think I miscalculated 10^{5 - k} * 2^{-k} as 100 * (1/2) instead of 100 * (1/8). Wait, no, 2^{-3} is 1/8, not 1/2.

Wait, 2^{-k} when k=3 is 2^{-3} = 1/8, not 1/2. So 10^{2} * 2^{-3} = 100 * (1/8) = 12.5

So, 12.5 is correct, not 500.

So, the coefficient is 10 * (-1) * 12.5 = -125

So, the constant term is -125.

Wait, so why did I get -12,500 earlier? Because I thought 2^{-k} was 2^{-1}, but no, for k=3, it's 2^{-3}.

So, that was my mistake. So, the correct coefficient is -125.

Let me verify this again.

Compute the coefficient step by step:

1. binom(5,3) = 10
2. (-1)^3 = -1
3. 10^{5 - 3} = 10^2 = 100
4. 2^{-3} = 1/8
5. 5^{5 - 3} = 5^2 = 25

Multiply all together:

10 * (-1) * 100 * (1/8) * 25

Compute step by step:

10 * (-1) = -10

-10 * 100 = -1000

-1000 * (1/8) = -125

-125 * 25 = -3125

Wait, now I'm getting -3125. Hmm, this is conflicting with my previous result.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, 10^{5 - k} is 100, and 2^{-k} is 1/8, so 100 * (1/8) = 12.5

Then, 12.5 * 5^{2} = 12.5 * 25 = 312.5

Then, 10 * (-1) * 312.5 = -3125

Wait, so now I'm getting -3125.

Wait, so which is correct? Let me re-express the coefficient.

The coefficient is:

binom(5,3) * 10^{2} * (-1)^3 * (1/2)^3 * 5^{2}

So, binom(5,3) = 10

10^{2} = 100

(-1)^3 = -1

(1/2)^3 = 1/8

5^{2} = 25

So, 10 * 100 * (-1) * (1/8) * 25

Compute 10 * 100 = 1000

1000 * (-1) = -1000

-1000 * (1/8) = -125

-125 * 25 = -3125

So, the coefficient is -3125.

Wait, so why did I get different results earlier? Because I was combining 10^{5 - k} and 2^{-k} as 2^{5 - 2k} * 5^{5 - k}, which is correct, but when I compute 2^{5 - 2k} * 5^{5 - k}, for k=3, that's 2^{-1} * 25 = 12.5, and then 10 * (-1) * 12.5 = -125. But that's not considering the 5^{5 - k} term.

Wait, no, actually, 2^{5 - 2k} * 5^{5 - k} is part of the coefficient, but binom(5,3) is 10, and (-1)^3 is -1, so the total coefficient is 10 * (-1) * 2^{5 - 2k} * 5^{5 - k}

Wait, for k=3, that's 10 * (-1) * 2^{-1} * 5^{2} = 10 * (-1) * (1/2) * 25 = 10 * (-1) * 12.5 = -125

But that's not matching with the other way.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the steps.

Wait, let's go back.

The general term is:

binom(5, k) * (10x^3)^{5 - k} * (-1/(2x^2))^k

Which is binom(5, k) * 10^{5 - k} x^{15 - 3k} * (-1)^k * (1/2)^k x^{-2k}

So, combining constants:

binom(5, k) * 10^{5 - k} * (-1)^k * (1/2)^k

And combining x terms:

x^{15 - 3k - 2k} = x^{15 - 5k}

So, for the constant term, 15 - 5k = 0 => k=3

So, plug k=3:

binom(5,3) * 10^{2} * (-1)^3 * (1/2)^3

Compute each part:

binom(5,3) = 10

10^{2} = 100

(-1)^3 = -1

(1/2)^3 = 1/8

Multiply all together:

10 * 100 * (-1) * (1/8) = 10 * 100 = 1000; 1000 * (-1) =","[1000*(-1), '1000 * (-1)']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",False
"To determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), I'll start by substituting \(n\) with 2 in the expression.

"Alright, so I have this problem about a regular pentagon that's being rotated. The question is asking how many degrees it needs to be rotated around its center, in the opposite direction of a clock's hands, so that it ends up in the same position as it started. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that a regular pentagon has all its sides equal and all its internal angles equal. Since it's a five-sided polygon, it's called a pentagon. Now, when they talk about rotating it around its center, I'm assuming it's a rotational symmetry problem. Rotational symmetry means that when you rotate the shape around its center by a certain angle, it looks the same as it did before the rotation.

I remember that for regular polygons, the angle by which you can rotate them to look the same is related to how many sides they have. Specifically, the formula for the smallest angle of rotation that maps the shape onto itself is 360 degrees divided by the number of sides. So for a pentagon, that would be 360 divided by 5.

Let me write that down: 360° / 5 = 72°. So, if I rotate the pentagon by 72 degrees in the opposite direction of a clock's hands, it should look the same as it did before. That makes sense because each vertex would move to the position of the next vertex, and since there are five vertices, after five such rotations, it would complete a full circle.

Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum number of degrees needed to rotate it so that it coincides with its original position. So, is it 72 degrees? Because rotating it by 72 degrees would align each vertex with the next one, making the pentagon look exactly as it did before.

Let me double-check. If I rotate it by 72 degrees, each vertex moves to the position of the next vertex. Since there are five vertices, after five such rotations, it would have gone around the center once, totaling 360 degrees. So, 72 degrees is indeed the smallest angle needed for the pentagon to coincide with its original position when rotated around its center in the opposite direction of a clock's hands.

I think that's the answer. It's based on the rotational symmetry of a regular pentagon, where each rotation by 72 degrees maps the pentagon onto itself. So, the minimal angle required is 72 degrees.
</think>

The minimum number of degrees required to rotate a regular pentagon around its center in the opposite direction of a clock's hands so that it coincides with its original position is determined by its rotational symmetry. 

For a regular pentagon, the smallest angle of rotation that maps the shape onto itself is calculated by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides, which is 5. 

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Thus, the pentagon needs to be rotated by 72 degrees.

Alright, so I have this problem about a parallelogram with three given coordinates: (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and the fourth one is (x, y) where x is greater than 7. I need to find x + y. Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. That means the midpoints of the diagonals should be the same. So, maybe I can use the midpoint formula here. The midpoint of a diagonal in a parallelogram is the average of the coordinates of its endpoints.

Let me label the points to make it clearer. Let's say the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y). Now, in a parallelogram, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the midpoint of AC should be the same as the midpoint of BD.

Calculating the midpoint of AC: The x-coordinate is (5 + 7)/2 = 12/2 = 6. The y-coordinate is (3 + 4)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5. So, the midpoint is (6, 3.5).

Now, the midpoint of BD should also be (6, 3.5). Let's calculate the midpoint of BD. The coordinates of B are (6,8) and D are (x,y). So, the midpoint is ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2). Setting this equal to (6, 3.5), we get two equations:

(6 + x)/2 = 6
(8 + y)/2 = 3.5

Solving the first equation: (6 + x)/2 = 6 => 6 + x = 12 => x = 6.

Wait, but the problem says x > 7. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Let me double-check. Maybe I assigned the points incorrectly. Perhaps the points aren't in the order I thought. Maybe the diagonals are different. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, in a parallelogram, the vector from one point to another should be equal to the vector from the third point to the fourth. So, for example, the vector from A to B should be the same as the vector from C to D.

Calculating vector AB: (6 - 5, 8 - 3) = (1, 5). So, vector CD should also be (1,5). Since point C is (7,4), adding the vector (1,5) to C gives D as (7 + 1, 4 + 5) = (8,9). So, x = 8 and y = 9. Then x + y = 17.

Wait, that makes sense because x > 7, so x = 8 is valid. Let me check if this works with the midpoint method.

Midpoint of AC is (6, 3.5) as before. Midpoint of BD: B is (6,8) and D is (8,9). Midpoint is ((6 + 8)/2, (8 + 9)/2) = (14/2, 17/2) = (7, 8.5). Wait, that's not the same as the midpoint of AC, which was (6, 3.5). That doesn't make sense. Did I do something wrong?

Hmm, maybe I assigned the vectors incorrectly. Let me try another vector approach. Maybe vector AD equals vector BC.

Vector AD: (x - 5, y - 3). Vector BC: (7 - 6, 4 - 8) = (1, -4). So, setting (x - 5, y - 3) = (1, -4), we get x = 6 and y = -1. But x = 6 is not greater than 7, so that's not valid.

Wait, maybe I should consider a different pair of vectors. Let's try vector AB equals vector DC.

Vector AB is (1,5). So, vector DC should be (1,5). Since point D is (x,y) and point C is (7,4), vector DC is (7 - x, 4 - y). Setting this equal to (1,5):

7 - x = 1 => x = 6
4 - y = 5 => y = -1

Again, x = 6 which is not greater than 7. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to consider a different pair of points.

Alternatively, maybe the diagonals are AC and BD, but I might have mixed up the points. Let me try assigning the points differently. Suppose the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), C(x,y), and D(7,4). Then diagonals would be AC and BD.

Midpoint of AC: ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2)
Midpoint of BD: ((6 + 7)/2, (8 + 4)/2) = (13/2, 12/2) = (6.5, 6)

Setting midpoints equal:

(5 + x)/2 = 6.5 => 5 + x = 13 => x = 8
(3 + y)/2 = 6 => 3 + y = 12 => y = 9

So, D is (8,9), which satisfies x > 7. Then x + y = 8 + 9 = 17.

Wait, that makes sense. Earlier, I might have incorrectly assigned the points, leading to confusion. So, by correctly assigning the diagonals and solving, I get x = 8 and y = 9, so x + y = 17.
</think>

The fourth vertex of the parallelogram is found by ensuring the midpoints of the diagonals coincide. Solving the equations gives x = 8 and y = 9, so x + y = 17.

"Alright, so I have this function here: f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote, and then add up their x-values and the y-value of the horizontal asymptote. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, right? Because the function becomes undefined at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find those x-values. The denominator is x² - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring that.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see. The factors of 14 are 1 and 14, 2 and 7. If I take 2 and -7, their product is -14 and their sum is -5. Perfect! So, the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a and b are -2 and 7, respectively.

Wait, hold on, the problem says the vertical asymptotes are at x = a and x = b. So, a is -2 and b is 7. So, a + b would be -2 + 7, which is 5. Okay, that's straightforward.

Now, for the horizontal asymptote. I remember that the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² - 5x -14, which is degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c is 0.

Therefore, a + b + c is 5 + 0, which is 5. So, the answer should be 5.

Wait, let me double-check. For vertical asymptotes, I factored the denominator correctly. x² -5x -14 factors into (x + 2)(x - 7), so yes, x = -2 and x = 7 are vertical asymptotes. For horizontal asymptotes, since the denominator's degree is higher, it's y = 0. So, c is 0. Adding them up: -2 + 7 + 0 = 5. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps are pretty straightforward. Factor the denominator, find the roots for vertical asymptotes, compare degrees for horizontal asymptote. So, I'm confident the answer is 5.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for any two-dimensional vector \( \mathbf{v} \), the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} \right\| \leq C \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

holds true. Hmm, okay. I remember that this kind of problem relates to the concept of operator norms in linear algebra. The operator norm of a matrix is the smallest number \( C \) such that the inequality above is satisfied for all vectors \( \mathbf{v} \). So, essentially, I need to find the operator norm of the given matrix.

First, let me recall that the operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is equal to the largest singular value of \( A \). Singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \), where \( A^T \) is the transpose of \( A \). So, my plan is to compute the singular values of the given matrix and then take the largest one as \( C \).

Let me write down the matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to compute \( A^T A \). The transpose of \( A \), denoted \( A^T \), is:

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Multiplying \( A^T \) and \( A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let me compute each element of the resulting matrix:

- The element at position (1,1) is \( 2 \times 2 + 0 \times 0 = 4 \).
- The element at position (1,2) is \( 2 \times 3 + 0 \times (-2) = 6 \).
- The element at position (2,1) is \( 3 \times 2 + (-2) \times 0 = 6 \).
- The element at position (2,2) is \( 3 \times 3 + (-2) \times (-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 \).

So, putting it all together:

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues \( \lambda \) satisfy the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

Where \( I \) is the identity matrix. So, let's compute the determinant:

\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - (6)(6) = 0
\]

Expanding the determinant:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = 0
\]

Let me compute \( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) \):

\[
4 \times 13 - 4 \lambda - 13 \lambda + \lambda^2 = 52 - 17\lambda + \lambda^2
\]

So, subtracting 36:

\[
52 - 17\lambda + \lambda^2 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

So, the quadratic equation is:

\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

Let me solve for \( \lambda \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{(-17)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 16}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2}
\]

Since \( \sqrt{225} = 15 \), this simplifies to:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

So, the two eigenvalues are:

1. \( \lambda_1 = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
2. \( \lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are 16 and 1. The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, so:

- \( \sigma_1 = \sqrt{16} = 4 \)
- \( \sigma_2 = \sqrt{1} = 1 \)

Hence, the largest singular value is 4. Therefore, the operator norm \( C \) is 4. This means that for any vector \( \mathbf{v} \), the inequality

\[
\left\| A \mathbf{v} \right\| \leq 4 \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

holds true, and 4 is the smallest such constant.

Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, computing \( A^T A \):

- First row, first column: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4
- First row, second column: 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6
- Second row, first column: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6
- Second row, second column: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13

Yes, that looks correct. Then, the determinant calculation:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = 0
\]

Expanding:

\[
52 - 17\lambda + \lambda^2 - 36 = \lambda^2 -17\lambda +16 =0
\]

Solutions:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

So, 16 and 1. Square roots are 4 and 1. So, yes, the largest singular value is 4. Therefore, \( C = 4 \).

I think that's correct. So, the smallest such \( C \) is 4.
</think>

The smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all two-dimensional vectors \( \mathbf{v} \) is the largest singular value of the matrix. The singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). Calculating these, we find the eigenvalues to be 16 and 1, leading to singular values of 4 and 1. Thus, the largest singular value is 4.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) given that \( z \) is a complex number satisfying \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the equation \( z^5 = 1 \) has five solutions, which are the 5th roots of unity. These roots are complex numbers evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. Since \( z \neq 1 \), we're dealing with one of the other four roots. These roots can be expressed using Euler's formula as \( z = e^{2\pi i k/5} \) where \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

Now, the expression I need to compute is \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Let me see if I can simplify this expression somehow. I notice that \( \frac{1}{z} \) is the same as \( z^{-1} \), and similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^{-2} \). So, the expression becomes \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} \).

Hmm, maybe I can pair these terms in a way that makes it easier to handle. Let me group them as \( (z + z^{-1}) + (z^2 + z^{-2}) \). That seems manageable. I recall that \( z + z^{-1} \) is related to the cosine function because \( z = e^{i\theta} \) implies \( z + z^{-1} = 2\cos\theta \). Similarly, \( z^2 + z^{-2} = 2\cos(2\theta) \). So, if I can express this in terms of cosines, maybe I can find a real value for the expression.

Let me write that down. If \( z = e^{2\pi i k/5} \), then \( \theta = \frac{2\pi k}{5} \). Therefore, \( z + z^{-1} = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) \) and \( z^2 + z^{-2} = 2\cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right) \). So, the entire expression becomes \( 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) + 2\cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right) \).

Hmm, that simplifies the problem to finding the sum of two cosines. I wonder if there's a trigonometric identity that can help me combine these terms or find their sum. I remember that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed as a product, but I'm not sure if that will help here. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the numerical values for each \( k \) and see if there's a pattern or a constant value.

Wait, but before I jump into numerical calculations, let me think if there's a more algebraic approach. Since \( z^5 = 1 \), I can use this to express higher powers of \( z \) in terms of lower powers. For example, \( z^5 = 1 \) implies \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which factors as \( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). That's a useful equation because it relates \( z \) and its powers.

Let me write that down: \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Maybe I can use this to express \( z^4 \) in terms of lower powers: \( z^4 = -z^3 - z^2 - z - 1 \). Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful, but perhaps if I consider the expression \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} \), I can manipulate it using this equation.

Wait, another thought: since \( z^5 = 1 \), \( z^{-1} = z^4 \), \( z^{-2} = z^3 \), and so on. So, \( z^{-1} = z^4 \) and \( z^{-2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \). That's interesting because from the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1 \). Therefore, \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \).

Wait a second! That means the expression \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} \) is equal to \( -1 \). So, is the value of the expression simply \( -1 \)?

But hold on, let me verify that. If \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), then \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \). But in our expression, we have \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} \). Since \( z^{-1} = z^4 \) and \( z^{-2} = z^3 \), substituting these in, we get \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \), which is exactly \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \), which equals \( -1 \). So, yes, the expression simplifies to \( -1 \).

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me test this with a specific root. Let's take \( z = e^{2\pi i /5} \). Then, \( z + z^{-1} = 2\cos(2\pi/5) \) and \( z^2 + z^{-2} = 2\cos(4\pi/5) \). So, the expression becomes \( 2\cos(2\pi/5) + 2\cos(4\pi/5) \).

I know that \( \cos(4\pi/5) = \cos(\pi - \pi/5) = -\cos(\pi/5) \). Similarly, \( \cos(2\pi/5) \) is just \( \cos(2\pi/5) \). So, the expression becomes \( 2\cos(2\pi/5) - 2\cos(\pi/5) \).

Hmm, let me compute the numerical values. I remember that \( \cos(\pi/5) \) is approximately 0.8090 and \( \cos(2\pi/5) \) is approximately 0.3090. So, plugging these in, we get \( 2(0.3090) - 2(0.8090) = 0.618 - 1.618 = -1 \). So, that checks out.

Let me try another root, say \( z = e^{4\pi i /5} \). Then, \( z + z^{-1} = 2\cos(4\pi/5) = 2(-0.8090) = -1.618 \) and \( z^2 + z^{-2} = 2\cos(8\pi/5) \). But \( 8\pi/5 \) is equivalent to \( 8\pi/5 - 2\pi = -2\pi/5 \), and cosine is even, so \( \cos(8\pi/5) = \cos(2\pi/5) \approx 0.3090 \). Therefore, \( z^2 + z^{-2} = 2(0.3090) = 0.618 \). Adding these together: \( -1.618 + 0.618 = -1 \). So, that also gives -1.

Wait, so both \( z = e^{2\pi i /5} \) and \( z = e^{4\pi i /5} \) give the expression equal to -1. What about \( z = e^{6\pi i /5} \)? Let's see. \( z = e^{6\pi i /5} = e^{(6\pi/5 - 2\pi)i} = e^{-4\pi i /5} \). So, \( z + z^{-1} = 2\cos(6\pi/5) = 2\cos(6\pi/5) \). But \( 6\pi/5 = \pi + \pi/5 \), so \( \cos(6\pi/5) = -\cos(\pi/5) \approx -0.8090 \). Therefore, \( z + z^{-1} = -1.618 \). Similarly, \( z^2 = e^{12\pi i /5} = e^{(12\pi/5 - 2\pi)i} = e^{2\pi i /5} \), so \( z^2 + z^{-2} = 2\cos(12\pi/5) = 2\cos(2\pi/5) \approx 0.618 \). Adding them together: \( -1.618 + 0.618 = -1 \). So, again, it's -1.

Same with \( z = e^{8\pi i /5} \). \( z + z^{-1} = 2\cos(8\pi/5) = 2\cos(2\pi/5) \approx 0.618 \), and \( z^2 = e^{16\pi i /5} = e^{(16\pi/5 - 2\pi)i} = e^{6\pi i /5} \), so \( z^2 + z^{-2} = 2\cos(16\pi/5) = 2\cos(6\pi/5) = 2(-0.8090) = -1.618 \). Adding them: \( 0.618 - 1.618 = -1 \). So, again, it's -1.

Therefore, regardless of which 5th root of unity we take (other than 1), the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) equals -1. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, going back to the algebraic approach, since \( z^5 = 1 \), we can write \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which factors as \( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1 \). But as we saw earlier, \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = (z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4) = -1 \). So, that's another way to see it.

I think I've confirmed it both algebraically and numerically, so I'm pretty confident the answer is -1.

Given that \( z \) is a complex number satisfying \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, we note that the solutions to \( z^5 = 1 \) are the 5th roots of unity, which can be expressed as \( z = e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we consider \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

The expression we need to compute is \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Using the property of roots of unity, we know that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

We use the fact that \( z^5 = 1 \) implies \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1 \). Thus, the expression \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \) simplifies to \( -1 \).

"Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that \(\sec x\) is the reciprocal of \(\cos x\), so maybe I can rewrite that to make things clearer.

First, let me write \(\sec x\) as \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\). So substituting that into the expression, it becomes \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify each term separately.

Looking at the first term, \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\), that's the same as \(\frac{1}{\cos x \cdot \sin x}\). So now the expression is \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). 

I notice that both terms have a \(\cos x\) in the denominator, so maybe I can combine them by getting a common denominator. The first term already has \(\cos x \sin x\) in the denominator, and the second term has just \(\cos x\). So to combine them, I need to multiply the numerator and denominator of the second term by \(\sin x\). Let me try that.

Multiplying the second term by \(\frac{\sin x}{\sin x}\) gives me \(\frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). Now both terms have the same denominator, so I can subtract the numerators: \(1 - \sin^2 x\) over \(\cos x \sin x\).

Wait, \(1 - \sin^2 x\) is a Pythagorean identity. I remember that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So substituting that in, the expression becomes \(\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). 

Now, I can simplify the fraction by canceling out a \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator. That leaves me with \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\). 

And \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is another trigonometric identity. I think that's the cotangent function, so this simplifies to \(\cot x\).

First, the problem says that three trunks and one gumball weigh the same as two trunks. So, if I let T represent the weight of a trunk and G represent the weight of a gumball, the equation would be 3T + G = 2T. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Oh, maybe I misread it. It says three trunks and one gumball are equal in weight to two trunks. So, 3T + G = 2T. If I subtract 2T from both sides, I get T + G = 0. That can't be right because weights can't be negative. Maybe I set it up wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's three trunks and one gumball equal to two trunks. So, 3T + G = 2T. Subtracting 2T from both sides gives T + G = 0, which still doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to rearrange it differently.

Alternatively, maybe it's three trunks equal to two trunks plus one gumball. So, 3T = 2T + G. Subtracting 2T from both sides gives T = G. So, one trunk equals one gumball. But the question asks how many trunks equal the weight of one gumball. If T = G, then one trunk equals one gumball. So, the answer would be one trunk.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. If 3T + G = 2T, then T + G = 0, which is impossible. So, maybe the correct setup is 3T = 2T + G, leading to T = G. Yeah, that makes sense. So, one trunk equals one gumball. Therefore, one trunk equals the weight of one gumball.

"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of \( a + b \) given two polynomials and their product. The polynomials are \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \), and their product is given as \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you have to use the distributive property, multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms. So, maybe I can multiply these two polynomials myself and then compare the coefficients with the given product to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

Let me write down the multiplication step by step. The first polynomial is \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and the second is \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \). So, multiplying them:

\( (3t^2)(4t^2) = 12t^4 \)

\( (3t^2)(bt) = 3b t^3 \)

\( (3t^2)(-2) = -6t^2 \)

Then, moving to the next term in the first polynomial:

\( (5t)(4t^2) = 20t^3 \)

\( (5t)(bt) = 5b t^2 \)

\( (5t)(-2) = -10t \)

Now, the last term in the first polynomial:

\( (a)(4t^2) = 4a t^2 \)

\( (a)(bt) = ab t \)

\( (a)(-2) = -2a \)

So, putting all these together, the product is:

\( 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t + (-2a) \)

Now, according to the problem, this product should equal \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \). So, I can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \( t \).

Let's write down each coefficient comparison:

1. For \( t^4 \): The coefficient is 12 in both, so that's already matching. No problem there.

2. For \( t^3 \): In our product, it's \( 3b + 20 \), and in the given polynomial, it's 26. So, we have the equation:

\( 3b + 20 = 26 \)

3. For \( t^2 \): Our product has \( -6 + 5b + 4a \), and the given polynomial has -8. So:

\( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)

4. For \( t \): Our product is \( -10 + ab \), and the given polynomial has -16. So:

\( -10 + ab = -16 \)

5. For the constant term: Our product is \( -2a \), and the given polynomial has 6. So:

\( -2a = 6 \)

Alright, so now I have a system of equations:

1. \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)  → Let's call this Equation (1)

2. \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)  → Equation (2)

3. \( -10 + ab = -16 \)  → Equation (3)

4. \( -2a = 6 \)  → Equation (4)

Hmm, Equation (4) seems straightforward. Let me solve that first.

From Equation (4):

\( -2a = 6 \)

Divide both sides by -2:

\( a = 6 / (-2) = -3 \)

So, \( a = -3 \). Got that.

Now, let's plug \( a = -3 \) into Equation (2) to find \( b \).

Equation (2):

\( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)

Substitute \( a = -3 \):

\( -6 + 5b + 4*(-3) = -8 \)

Calculate \( 4*(-3) = -12 \):

\( -6 + 5b -12 = -8 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (-6 -12) + 5b = -8 \)

\( -18 + 5b = -8 \)

Now, add 18 to both sides:

\( 5b = -8 + 18 \)

\( 5b = 10 \)

Divide both sides by 5:

\( b = 10 / 5 = 2 \)

So, \( b = 2 \). Okay, so far, \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \).

Let me check if these values satisfy Equation (3) to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Equation (3):

\( -10 + ab = -16 \)

Substitute \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \):

\( -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 -6 = -16 \)

Yes, that's correct. So, Equation (3) is satisfied.

Just to be thorough, let me check Equation (1) as well, even though it's straightforward.

Equation (1):

\( 3b + 20 = 26 \)

Substitute \( b = 2 \):

\( 3*2 + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26 \)

Perfect, that's correct too.

So, all equations are satisfied with \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \).

Wait, hold on, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to mix up signs or coefficients.

Let me recompute the product with \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \) to see if it indeed gives the given polynomial.

First polynomial: \( 3t^2 + 5t + a = 3t^2 + 5t - 3 \)

Second polynomial: \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 = 4t^2 + 2t - 2 \)

Multiply them:

\( (3t^2)(4t^2) = 12t^4 \)

\( (3t^2)(2t) = 6t^3 \)

\( (3t^2)(-2) = -6t^2 \)

\( (5t)(4t^2) = 20t^3 \)

\( (5t)(2t) = 10t^2 \)

\( (5t)(-2) = -10t \)

\( (-3)(4t^2) = -12t^2 \)

\( (-3)(2t) = -6t \)

\( (-3)(-2) = 6 \)

Now, let's add all these terms together:

- \( 12t^4 \)
- \( 6t^3 + 20t^3 = 26t^3 \)
- \( -6t^2 + 10t^2 -12t^2 = (-6 +10 -12)t^2 = (-8)t^2 \)
- \( -10t -6t = -16t \)
- \( 6 \)

So, the product is \( 12t^4 +26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \), which matches the given polynomial. Perfect, so my values for \( a \) and \( b \) are correct.

Therefore, \( a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \).

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the product checks out. So, the answer should be \( -1 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{-1}.
</think>

To find the value of \( a + b \) given the polynomials \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \) whose product is \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

Expanding \( (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) \):

1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:
   - \( 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4 \)
   - \( 3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3 \)
   - \( 3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2 \)
   - \( 5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3 \)
   - \( 5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2 \)
   - \( 5t \cdot (-2) = -10t \)
   - \( a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2 \)
   - \( a \cdot bt = abt \)
   - \( a \cdot (-2) = -2a \)

2. Combine like terms:
   - \( 12t^4 \)
   - \( (3b + 20)t^3 \)
   - \( (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 \)
   - \( (-10 + ab)t \)
   - \( -2a \)

3. Set the coefficients equal to those in the given polynomial \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \):
   - For \( t^3 \): \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)
   - For \( t^2 \): \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)
   - For \( t \): \( -10 + ab = -16 \)
   - For the constant term: \( -2a = 6 \)

4. Solve the system of equations:
   - From \( -2a = 6 \), we get \( a = -3 \).
   - Substitute \( a = -3 \) into \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \):
     - \( -6 + 5b + 4(-3) = -8 \)
     - \( -6 + 5b - 12 = -8 \)
     - \( -18 + 5b = -8 \)
     - \( 5b = 10 \)
     - \( b = 2 \)
   - Verify with \( -10 + ab = -16 \):
     - \( -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \)
     - \( -10 - 6 = -16 \)

Thus, \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \).

The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{-1}.","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem about a hemispherical tank that's being filled with water. The tank has a spherical base, and it's filled at a rate of 20π cubic meters per hour. As the tank fills up, the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. I need to find the radius of the tank, and express it in the simplest radical form.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the tank. It's a hemisphere, so it's half of a sphere. The base is a circle, and the radius of that base is the same as the radius of the hemisphere. So, if I can find the radius, that's my answer.

The tank is being filled at a rate of 20π m³/h. That's the volume flow rate. Also, the height of the water is increasing at 4 m/h. So, I think I can relate these two rates to find the radius.

I remember that the volume of a spherical cap is given by the formula:

V = (πh²(3r - h))/3

Where V is the volume, h is the height of the cap, and r is the radius of the sphere. Since the tank is a hemisphere, the maximum height h can be is equal to the radius r.

But in this case, as the tank is being filled, h is increasing. So, I can differentiate the volume with respect to time to find the rate of change of volume, which is given as 20π m³/h.

Let me write down the volume formula again:

V = (πh²(3r - h))/3

I need to find dV/dt. So, let's differentiate both sides with respect to time t.

dV/dt = (π/3) * d/dt [h²(3r - h)]

Using the product rule for differentiation:

d/dt [h²(3r - h)] = 2h * dh/dt * (3r - h) + h² * (-dh/dt)

Simplify that:

= 2h(3r - h) * dh/dt - h² * dh/dt

Factor out dh/dt:

= dh/dt [2h(3r - h) - h²]

Simplify inside the brackets:

= dh/dt [6hr - 2h² - h²] = dh/dt [6hr - 3h²]

So, putting it all together:

dV/dt = (π/3) * dh/dt * (6hr - 3h²)

We know dV/dt is 20π, and dh/dt is 4 m/h. So, plug those in:

20π = (π/3) * 4 * (6hr - 3h²)

Simplify the equation:

20π = (4π/3)(6hr - 3h²)

Divide both sides by π:

20 = (4/3)(6hr - 3h²)

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:

60 = 4(6hr - 3h²)

Divide both sides by 4:

15 = 6hr - 3h²

Let me write that as:

6hr - 3h² = 15

I can factor out a 3h:

3h(2r - h) = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

h(2r - h) = 5

Hmm, so h(2r - h) = 5. But I don't know h yet. Wait, maybe I can express h in terms of r. Since the tank is a hemisphere, when it's full, h would be equal to r. But right now, it's not full, so h is less than r.

Wait, but I don't have the total volume or the time taken to fill it. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the relationship between the volume and the height. Since the volume is increasing at a constant rate, and the height is increasing at a constant rate, maybe I can relate them.

Wait, let me think. If dh/dt is constant, that suggests that the cross-sectional area is changing in such a way that the volume increases linearly with time. But in reality, for a spherical tank, the cross-sectional area changes with height, so the volume doesn't increase linearly unless the radius is such that the product of the area and dh/dt is constant.

Wait, maybe I can set up the equation differently. Let me go back to the differentiated equation:

dV/dt = (π/3) * dh/dt * (6hr - 3h²)

We have dV/dt = 20π, dh/dt = 4, so:

20π = (π/3) * 4 * (6hr - 3h²)

Simplify:

20π = (4π/3)(6hr - 3h²)

Divide both sides by π:

20 = (4/3)(6hr - 3h²)

Multiply both sides by 3:

60 = 4(6hr - 3h²)

Divide by 4:

15 = 6hr - 3h²

So, 6hr - 3h² = 15

Let me factor this:

3h(2r - h) = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

h(2r - h) = 5

So, h(2r - h) = 5

Hmm, this is a quadratic in h. Maybe I can express it as:

2r h - h² = 5

Or, rearranged:

h² - 2r h + 5 = 0

Wait, but I don't know h or r. I need another equation to relate h and r.

Wait, but in a hemisphere, the radius of the base is equal to the radius of the hemisphere. So, when the tank is filled to height h, the radius of the water's surface is related to h and r.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the radius of the circular surface at height h in a hemisphere. I think it's given by:

a² + (r - h)² = r²

Where a is the radius of the circular surface at height h.

Expanding that:

a² + r² - 2rh + h² = r²

Simplify:

a² = 2rh - h²

So, a = sqrt(2rh - h²)

But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Wait, maybe I can think about the volume formula again. The volume of the spherical cap is V = (πh²(3r - h))/3. Since the tank is a hemisphere, when it's full, h = r, and V = (πr²(3r - r))/3 = (πr²(2r))/3 = (2πr³)/3, which is correct for a hemisphere.

But in our case, the volume is increasing at a constant rate, and the height is increasing at a constant rate. So, maybe I can express h as a function of time.

Let me assume that h = kt + c, but since at t=0, h=0, so c=0. So, h = kt. Given that dh/dt = 4, so k=4. Therefore, h = 4t.

So, h = 4t.

Now, plug this into the volume formula:

V = (π(4t)²(3r - 4t))/3 = (π*16t²*(3r - 4t))/3

But the volume is also equal to the integral of dV/dt from 0 to t, which is 20π*t.

So,

(π*16t²*(3r - 4t))/3 = 20π t

Divide both sides by π:

(16t²(3r - 4t))/3 = 20t

Multiply both sides by 3:

16t²(3r - 4t) = 60t

Divide both sides by t (assuming t ≠ 0):

16t(3r - 4t) = 60

So,

48rt - 64t² = 60

Hmm, this is a quadratic in t. But I don't know t, so maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe I can use the earlier equation I had: h(2r - h) = 5

Since h = 4t, let's plug that in:

4t(2r - 4t) = 5

So,

8rt - 16t² = 5

But I don't know t, so this might not help either.

Wait, maybe I can find t when the tank is full. When the tank is full, h = r. So, let's set h = r in the equation h(2r - h) = 5:

r(2r - r) = 5 => r(r) = 5 => r² = 5 => r = sqrt(5)

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

If h = r, then plugging into h(2r - h) = 5:

r(2r - r) = r(r) = r² = 5 => r = sqrt(5)

So, the radius is sqrt(5) meters.

Wait, but let me verify this because I might have made a mistake.

So, when the tank is full, h = r. So, plugging into h(2r - h) = 5:

r(2r - r) = r² = 5 => r = sqrt(5). That seems correct.

But let me check if this satisfies the original equation.

So, if r = sqrt(5), then when h = r = sqrt(5), the equation h(2r - h) = 5 becomes sqrt(5)(2*sqrt(5) - sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)(sqrt(5)) = 5, which is correct.

So, that seems to work.

But wait, does this mean that the radius is sqrt(5) meters? Let me think.

But earlier, I had another equation: 6hr - 3h² = 15

If h = r, then 6r² - 3r² = 15 => 3r² = 15 => r² = 5 => r = sqrt(5). So, same result.

So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the radius of the tank is sqrt(5) meters.

Wait, but let me make sure that this makes sense in the context of the problem.

So, if the radius is sqrt(5), then the volume when full is (2/3)πr³ = (2/3)π*(sqrt(5))³ = (2/3)π*(5*sqrt(5)) = (10/3)π*sqrt(5). But I don't know the total volume, but since the problem doesn't ask for that, maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, let me check the differentiation step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with V = (πh²(3r - h))/3

Differentiate with respect to t:

dV/dt = (π/3)[2h dh/dt (3r - h) + h² (-dh/dt)]

= (π/3) dh/dt [2h(3r - h) - h²]

= (π/3) dh/dt [6hr - 2h² - h²]

= (π/3) dh/dt [6hr - 3h²]

Yes, that seems correct.

Then, plugging in dV/dt = 20π, dh/dt = 4:

20π = (π/3)*4*(6hr - 3h²)

Divide both sides by π:

20 = (4/3)(6hr - 3h²)

Multiply by 3:

60 = 4(6hr - 3h²)

Divide by 4:

15 = 6hr - 3h²

Which is the same as 3h(2r - h) = 15, so h(2r - h) = 5.

Then, when h = r, we get r² = 5, so r = sqrt(5). That seems consistent.

Therefore, the radius is sqrt(5) meters.

I think that's the answer.
</think>

The radius of the hemispherical tank is found by relating the rate of volume increase to the rate of height increase. Using the volume formula for a spherical cap and differentiating with respect to time, we derive the equation \( h(2r - h) = 5 \). When the tank is full, \( h = r \), leading to \( r^2 = 5 \). Thus, the radius is \( \sqrt{5} \) meters.

"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's equal to ax² when x is greater than or equal to a, and ax + 2a when x is less than a. I need to find the largest value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at most once. Hmm, that means the graph should be injective, right? So, no two different x-values should give the same y-value. 

First, let me visualize the function. For x >= a, it's a quadratic function, which is a parabola. Depending on the value of a, it could open upwards or downwards. If a is positive, it opens upwards; if a is negative, it opens downwards. For x < a, it's a linear function with slope a and y-intercept 2a. 

I need to ensure that the entire function is one-to-one, meaning it passes the horizontal line test. So, the function must be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing throughout its domain. But since it's piecewise, I have to check the behavior at the point where the function changes, which is at x = a.

Let me consider the two pieces separately. 

1. For x >= a: f(x) = ax². The derivative here is 2ax. So, if a is positive, the function is increasing for x >= a. If a is negative, it's decreasing for x >= a.

2. For x < a: f(x) = ax + 2a. The derivative is just a, which is constant. So, if a is positive, this part is increasing; if a is negative, it's decreasing.

Now, to ensure the entire function is one-to-one, both pieces must be either non-decreasing or non-increasing, and the point where they meet (at x = a) must not cause any overlap in y-values.

Let me think about the continuity at x = a. If the function is continuous there, it might help in ensuring that there are no sudden jumps that could cause the horizontal line test to fail. So, let's check the continuity at x = a.

Left-hand limit as x approaches a from below: f(a) = a*a + 2a = a² + 2a.

Right-hand limit as x approaches a from above: f(a) = a*a² = a³.

For continuity, these must be equal: a³ = a² + 2a.

So, a³ - a² - 2a = 0.

Factor out an a: a(a² - a - 2) = 0.

Factor the quadratic: a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0.

So, a = 0, a = 2, or a = -1.

But if a = 0, then the function becomes f(x) = 0 for all x, which is a constant function. That's definitely not injective because every y-value is 0, so it fails the horizontal line test. So, a = 0 is out.

If a = 2, let's see what happens. Then, the function is:

f(x) = 2x² for x >= 2,

f(x) = 2x + 4 for x < 2.

Is this function injective? Let's check.

First, for x >= 2, f(x) = 2x² is increasing because the derivative is 4x, which is positive for x >= 2.

For x < 2, f(x) = 2x + 4 is also increasing because the slope is positive.

Now, we need to check the value at x = 2. f(2) = 2*(2)^2 = 8.

From the left, as x approaches 2, f(x) approaches 2*2 + 4 = 8. So, it's continuous at x = 2.

Since both pieces are increasing and meet at the same value, the entire function is increasing. Therefore, it's injective. So, a = 2 is a candidate.

Now, let's check a = -1.

If a = -1, the function becomes:

f(x) = -x² for x >= -1,

f(x) = -x - 2 for x < -1.

Let's check continuity at x = -1.

Left-hand limit: f(-1) = -(-1) - 2 = -1 - 2 = -3.

Right-hand limit: f(-1) = -(-1)^2 = -1.

These are not equal, so the function is not continuous at x = -1. That might cause issues with the horizontal line test.

Let me see if the function is injective. For x >= -1, f(x) = -x², which is a downward-opening parabola. Its derivative is -2x, which is negative for x > 0 and positive for x < 0. So, for x >= -1, the function is decreasing for x > 0 and increasing for x between -1 and 0.

For x < -1, f(x) = -x - 2, which is a linear function with slope -1, so it's decreasing.

So, the function for x >= -1 is decreasing on (-1, 0) and increasing on (0, ∞). That means it's not strictly increasing or decreasing over its entire domain, so it's not injective. Therefore, a = -1 is not suitable.

So, a = 2 is a possible value. But the question is asking for the largest value of a such that the graph intersects every horizontal line at most once. So, maybe a can be larger than 2? Let's check.

Wait, if a is greater than 2, say a = 3, let's see what happens.

f(x) = 3x² for x >= 3,

f(x) = 3x + 6 for x < 3.

Check continuity at x = 3:

Left-hand limit: 3*3 + 6 = 15.

Right-hand limit: 3*(3)^2 = 27.

Not equal, so not continuous. But is the function injective?

For x >= 3, f(x) = 3x² is increasing because derivative is 6x, which is positive for x >= 3.

For x < 3, f(x) = 3x + 6 is increasing because slope is positive.

But wait, at x = 3, the left-hand limit is 15, and the right-hand limit is 27. So, the function jumps from 15 to 27 at x = 3. So, is there any overlap?

Let me see. For x >= 3, f(x) starts at 27 and increases. For x < 3, f(x) goes up to 15 as x approaches 3 from the left. So, the function is increasing on both sides, but there's a jump discontinuity at x = 3.

But does this cause the function to fail the horizontal line test? Let's see.

Suppose a horizontal line y = 20. For x >= 3, f(x) = 3x². Let's solve 3x² = 20: x = sqrt(20/3) ≈ 2.58, which is less than 3. So, no solution in x >= 3. For x < 3, f(x) = 3x + 6. Solve 3x + 6 = 20: x = 14/3 ≈ 4.666, which is greater than 3. So, no solution in x < 3 either. So, y = 20 is not achieved by the function. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, for x >= 3, f(x) starts at 27 and goes to infinity. For x < 3, f(x) goes from negative infinity up to 15. So, y = 20 is achieved by x < 3: 3x + 6 = 20 => x = 14/3 ≈ 4.666, but 14/3 is approximately 4.666, which is greater than 3. So, that's not in the domain x < 3. So, actually, y = 20 is not achieved by the function. So, that horizontal line doesn't intersect the graph at all.

Wait, but that's a problem because the horizontal line test requires that every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. If some lines don't intersect, that's fine, but if some lines intersect more than once, that's a problem. So, in this case, y = 20 is not intersected, which is okay. But what about y = 15?

For x >= 3, f(x) = 3x². 3x² = 15 => x² = 5 => x = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, which is less than 3. So, no solution in x >= 3. For x < 3, f(x) = 3x + 6. 3x + 6 = 15 => x = 3. But x = 3 is not in x < 3. So, y = 15 is not achieved either.

Wait, but what about y = 27? For x >= 3, f(x) = 27 when x = 3. For x < 3, f(x) = 3x + 6. 3x + 6 = 27 => x = 7, which is not less than 3. So, y = 27 is only achieved once at x = 3.

Wait, but if a is larger than 2, say a = 3, then the function is injective? Because for x >= a, it's increasing, and for x < a, it's increasing, but there's a jump discontinuity at x = a. So, the function is increasing on both sides, but the left side stops at f(a) = 2a, and the right side starts at f(a) = a³. So, if a³ > 2a, then there's a jump, but the function remains injective because the left side doesn't reach the value of the right side.

Wait, let's test a = 3. For x >= 3, f(x) starts at 27 and goes to infinity. For x < 3, f(x) goes from negative infinity up to 15. So, the range of the function is (-∞, 15) ∪ [27, ∞). So, any y between 15 and 27 is not achieved by the function. So, the function is injective because each y is achieved at most once. So, a = 3 is also a valid value.

But wait, the question is asking for the largest value of a. So, can a be larger than 2? Let's see.

Suppose a = 4. Then, f(x) = 4x² for x >= 4, and f(x) = 4x + 8 for x < 4.

Continuity at x = 4: Left-hand limit is 4*4 + 8 = 24. Right-hand limit is 4*16 = 64. So, not continuous.

For x >= 4, f(x) is increasing, starting at 64 and going to infinity.

For x < 4, f(x) is increasing, starting from negative infinity up to 24.

So, the range is (-∞, 24) ∪ [64, ∞). So, y-values between 24 and 64 are not achieved. So, the function is injective because each y is achieved at most once.

Wait, so if a is larger than 2, the function is still injective. So, why did a = 2 work? Because at a = 2, the function is continuous and strictly increasing, so it's injective. But for a > 2, the function is still injective, but it's not continuous. So, does that mean that a can be any value greater than 2?

Wait, but the question is asking for the largest value of a. If a can be any real number greater than 2, then there is no largest value. But that can't be, because the function's behavior might change for a > 2.

Wait, let me think again. For a > 2, the function is still injective because both pieces are increasing, and the left side doesn't overlap with the right side. So, the function is injective for all a > 2. But the question is asking for the largest value of a. So, is there a maximum a beyond which the function is no longer injective?

Wait, but for any a, as long as both pieces are increasing, the function is injective. So, if a is positive, both pieces are increasing, so the function is injective. If a is negative, the pieces might not be injective.

Wait, let's test a negative a. Let's say a = -2.

Then, f(x) = -2x² for x >= -2,

f(x) = -2x -4 for x < -2.

Check continuity at x = -2:

Left-hand limit: f(-2) = -2*(-2) -4 = 4 -4 = 0.

Right-hand limit: f(-2) = -2*(-2)^2 = -8.

Not equal, so not continuous.

For x >= -2, f(x) = -2x² is a downward-opening parabola. Its derivative is -4x, which is negative for x > 0 and positive for x < 0. So, it's increasing on (-2, 0) and decreasing on (0, ∞). So, it's not strictly increasing or decreasing over its entire domain, hence not injective.

Therefore, a = -2 is invalid.

So, for a negative, the function is not injective. For a positive, it's injective as long as both pieces are increasing, which they are for a > 0.

Wait, but for a = 0, it's a constant function, which is not injective. So, a must be positive.

But the question is asking for the largest value of a. If a can be any positive number, then there is no largest value. But that can't be, because the function's behavior might change.

Wait, but in the case of a = 2, the function is continuous and strictly increasing, so it's bijective. For a > 2, the function is still injective but not continuous. So, the function is injective for all a > 0, but the question is about the largest a. So, perhaps the answer is that a can be any positive real number, but the largest value is unbounded.

"Alright, so I have this equation: \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). I need to find the value of \( c \) such that the radius of the circle is 1. Hmm, okay. I remember that the general equation of a circle is \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where \( (h, k) \) is the center and \( r \) is the radius. 

First, I think I need to rewrite the given equation in the standard form of a circle. To do that, I should complete the square for both the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms. Let me try that.

Starting with the \( x \) terms: \( x^2 - 10x \). To complete the square, I take the coefficient of \( x \), which is -10, divide it by 2 to get -5, and then square it to get 25. So, I can write \( x^2 - 10x \) as \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).

Now for the \( y \) terms: \( y^2 + 6y \). Similarly, the coefficient of \( y \) is 6, so dividing by 2 gives 3, and squaring that gives 9. So, \( y^2 + 6y \) can be written as \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).

Putting it all back into the original equation, we have:
\( (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \).

Simplifying the constants: -25 - 9 is -34. So, the equation becomes:
\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \).

To get it into the standard circle form, I'll move the constant term to the other side:
\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \).

Now, the standard form is \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), so comparing, the radius squared is \( 34 - c \). We want the radius to be 1, so \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \).

Setting \( 34 - c = 1 \), solving for \( c \):
\( 34 - c = 1 \)
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\( -c = 1 - 34 \)
\( -c = -33 \)
Multiply both sides by -1:
\( c = 33 \).

Wait, let me double-check. If \( c = 33 \), then the right side becomes \( 34 - 33 = 1 \), which is correct. So, the radius is indeed 1. Yeah, that makes sense.
</think>

The given equation can be rewritten in the standard form of a circle by completing the square. After completing the square, we find that the radius squared is \(34 - c\). Setting this equal to \(1^2 = 1\) gives \(c = 33\).

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists an x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that f(x) is a quadratic function, and it's a common example in dynamical systems. It's called the logistic map, right? The parameter λ controls the behavior of the function. For different values of λ, the function can have different fixed points and periodic points.

The question is about points x where f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x. So, these are points that are not fixed points of f but are fixed points of f composed with itself, f². In other words, these are points of period 2 for the function f. So, essentially, I need to find the values of λ for which the logistic map has period-2 points.

To find these points, I should first find the fixed points of f, which satisfy f(x) = x. Then, I can look for points that are not fixed but satisfy f²(x) = x. The fixed points will be solutions to f(x) = x, and the period-2 points will be the other solutions to f²(x) = x.

Let me start by finding the fixed points of f. So, set f(x) = x:

λx(1 - x) = x

Let me rearrange this equation:

λx(1 - x) - x = 0

Factor out x:

x(λ(1 - x) - 1) = 0

So, the solutions are x = 0 and λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0.

Solving λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0:

λ(1 - x) = 1

1 - x = 1/λ

x = 1 - 1/λ

So, the fixed points are x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/λ, provided that 1 - 1/λ is within [0,1]. Since λ is between 0 and 4, let's see when 1 - 1/λ is in [0,1].

First, λ cannot be 0 because we have division by λ. So, λ is in (0,4].

For x = 1 - 1/λ to be in [0,1], 1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 and 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1.

1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 implies 1/λ ≤ 1, so λ ≥ 1.

1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 is always true because 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 simplifies to -1/λ ≤ 0, which is always true for λ > 0.

So, for λ ≥ 1, x = 1 - 1/λ is a fixed point in [0,1]. For λ < 1, x = 1 - 1/λ would be negative, which is outside the domain [0,1], so only x = 0 is the fixed point in that case.

Okay, so now I have the fixed points. Next, I need to find the period-2 points, which satisfy f²(x) = x but f(x) ≠ x.

To find f²(x), I need to compute f(f(x)). Let's compute that.

f(x) = λx(1 - x)

So, f(f(x)) = λ * f(x) * (1 - f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)]

Let me write that out:

f²(x) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)]

Simplify this expression:

First, let me compute the inner part: 1 - λx(1 - x) = 1 - λx + λx²

So, f²(x) = λ * λx(1 - x) * (1 - λx + λx²)

Which is:

f²(x) = λ²x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²)

Now, set f²(x) = x:

λ²x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) = x

Bring all terms to one side:

λ²x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - x = 0

Factor out x:

x [λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1] = 0

So, the solutions are x = 0 and the solutions to the equation:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1 = 0

We already know that x = 0 is a solution, but we are interested in solutions where f(x) ≠ x. So, x = 0 is a fixed point, so we need to find the other solutions where f(x) ≠ x.

So, let's focus on solving:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1 = 0

Let me expand this expression step by step.

First, expand (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):

Multiply 1 by each term: 1*(1) = 1, 1*(-λx) = -λx, 1*(λx²) = λx²

Then, multiply -x by each term: -x*(1) = -x, -x*(-λx) = λx², -x*(λx²) = -λx³

So, combining all these terms:

1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³

Now, combine like terms:

Constant term: 1

x terms: -λx - x = -(λ + 1)x

x² terms: λx² + λx² = 2λx²

x³ term: -λx³

So, altogether:

1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³

Therefore, the equation becomes:

λ²[1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³] - 1 = 0

Let me distribute λ²:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + λ²*2λx² - λ²*λx³ - 1 = 0

Simplify each term:

First term: λ²

Second term: -λ²(λ + 1)x = -λ³x - λ²x

Third term: 2λ³x²

Fourth term: -λ³x³

Fifth term: -1

So, putting it all together:

λ² - λ³x - λ²x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0

Now, let's rearrange the terms in descending powers of x:

-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - (λ³ + λ²)x + (λ² - 1) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

So, the equation is:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

Hmm, this is a cubic equation in x. Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe we can factor it or find some roots.

We know that x = 0 is a solution to f²(x) = x, but it's also a fixed point of f, so we can factor out x.

Wait, but in our equation, when x = 0, the left-hand side is:

0 - 0 + 0 - (λ² - 1) = -(λ² - 1). So, unless λ² - 1 = 0, x = 0 is not a solution here. Wait, but earlier, we had factored out x, so perhaps x = 0 is a solution, but in the equation above, when x = 0, it's not zero unless λ² - 1 = 0, which is λ = 1 or λ = -1. But since λ is between 0 and 4, λ = 1 is the only possibility.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the factoring. Let me double-check.

We had:

x [λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1] = 0

So, x = 0 is a solution, and the other solutions come from:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1 = 0

Which we expanded to:

λ² - λ³x - λ²x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0

So, when x = 0, this becomes λ² - 1 = 0, so λ² = 1, so λ = 1 or λ = -1. But since λ is in [0,4], only λ = 1.

So, for λ = 1, x = 0 is a solution to both f(x) = x and f²(x) = x. But for other λ, x = 0 is not a solution to f²(x) = x, except when λ = 1.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that x = 0 is a fixed point, so f²(0) = f(0) = 0, so f²(0) = 0, which is equal to f(0). So, x = 0 is always a fixed point, so it's a solution to f²(x) = x, but it's also a fixed point of f. So, in our problem, we are looking for x where f²(x) = x but f(x) ≠ x. So, x = 0 is not of interest here because f(x) = x at x = 0.

Similarly, x = 1 is a fixed point when λ = 1, but for other λ, x = 1 is not a fixed point. Wait, let's check.

Wait, f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0. So, f(1) = 0, which is not equal to 1 unless λ is something, but 0 ≠ 1, so x = 1 is never a fixed point except when λ is infinity, which isn't in our domain. So, x = 1 is not a fixed point for any λ in [0,4].

So, going back, we have the equation:

λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1 = 0

Which simplifies to:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

We can factor this equation as (x - something)(quadratic) = 0, but it's not obvious. Alternatively, maybe we can factor out (x - 1) or something else.

Wait, let me try plugging x = 1 into the equation:

λ³(1)^3 - 2λ³(1)^2 + (λ³ + λ²)(1) - (λ² - 1) = λ³ - 2λ³ + λ³ + λ² - λ² + 1 = (λ³ - 2λ³ + λ³) + (λ² - λ²) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0

So, x = 1 is not a root.

How about x = 1/2? Let me try plugging in x = 1/2:

λ³*(1/8) - 2λ³*(1/4) + (λ³ + λ²)*(1/2) - (λ² - 1)

= (λ³/8) - (λ³/2) + (λ³ + λ²)/2 - λ² + 1

Simplify each term:

= (λ³/8 - 4λ³/8) + (λ³/2 + λ²/2) - λ² + 1

= (-3λ³/8) + (λ³/2 + λ²/2) - λ² + 1

= (-3λ³/8 + 4λ³/8) + (λ²/2 - λ²) + 1

= (λ³/8) + (-λ²/2) + 1

Set equal to zero:

λ³/8 - λ²/2 + 1 = 0

Multiply both sides by 8:

λ³ - 4λ² + 8 = 0

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe trying specific λ values would help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the cubic equation.

Looking at the equation:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

Let me factor out λ² from the first three terms:

λ²(λx³ - 2λx² + (λ + 1)x) - (λ² - 1) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe factor by grouping.

Group the first two terms and the last two terms:

(λ³x³ - 2λ³x²) + ((λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1)) = 0

Factor out λ³x² from the first group:

λ³x²(x - 2) + (λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1)) = 0

Not sure if that helps either.

Alternatively, maybe factor out λ²:

λ²(λx³ - 2λx² + (λ + 1)x) - (λ² - 1) = 0

Still not helpful.

Perhaps I should consider that the cubic equation can be written as:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

Let me write it as:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ³x + λ²x - λ² + 1 = 0

Wait, that's the same as before. Maybe group terms differently:

(λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ³x) + (λ²x - λ² + 1) = 0

Factor out λ³x from the first group:

λ³x(x² - 2x + 1) + λ²(x - 1) + 1 = 0

Notice that x² - 2x + 1 is (x - 1)^2, so:

"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest positive angle θ in degrees such that the tangent of θ is equal to this big fraction. The numerator and the denominator both have a bunch of cosine and sine terms multiplied and added together. Hmm, okay, let me try to parse this step by step.

First, let me write down the given expression to make it clearer:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me see if I can simplify both the numerator and the denominator separately. Maybe there are some trigonometric identities that can help here.

Looking at the numerator first:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

Hmm, I notice that the first two terms are products of cosines, and the last two are products of sines. Maybe I can group them into two parts:

Group 1: \(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ\)

Group 2: \(\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ\)

Wait a second, these look familiar. Isn't there an identity for cosine of sum? Yes! The formula is:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B
\]

So, applying this identity to both groups:

Group 1 becomes \(\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ\)

Group 2 becomes \(\cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ\)

So, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

Alright, that's simpler. Now, let's look at the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

Hmm, this also has products of sine and cosine. Maybe I can group them similarly:

Group 1: \(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ\)

Group 2: \(-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ\)

Looking at these groups, I recall the sine addition formula:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]

So, Group 1 is \(\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ\)

Group 2 is \(-(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)\), which is \(-\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ\)

Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

So now, putting it all together, the expression for tan θ becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}
\]

Hmm, okay, so now I have a fraction with cosines in the numerator and sines in the denominator. Maybe I can use sum-to-product identities here to simplify further.

For the numerator, \(\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ\), the sum-to-product identity is:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos\left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos\left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right)
\]

Let me apply this with A = 25° and B = 85°:

\[
2 \cos\left( \frac{25 + 85}{2} \right) \cos\left( \frac{25 - 85}{2} \right) = 2 \cos(55^\circ) \cos(-30^\circ)
\]

But cosine is even, so \(\cos(-30^\circ) = \cos 30^\circ\). Therefore, numerator becomes:

\[
2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ
\]

Similarly, for the denominator, \(\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ\), the difference-to-product identity is:

\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos\left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin\left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right)
\]

Applying this with A = 25° and B = 85°:

\[
2 \cos\left( \frac{25 + 85}{2} \right) \sin\left( \frac{25 - 85}{2} \right) = 2 \cos(55^\circ) \sin(-30^\circ)
\]

Again, sine is odd, so \(\sin(-30^\circ) = -\sin 30^\circ\). Therefore, denominator becomes:

\[
2 \cos 55^\circ (-\sin 30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ
\]

So now, plugging these back into the expression for tan θ:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ}
\]

I notice that 2 and -2 cancel out, as well as \(\cos 55^\circ\) in numerator and denominator. So we have:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 30^\circ}{- \sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ}
\]

But \(\frac{\cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ}\) is cot 30°, which is equal to \(\tan 60^\circ\), since \(\cot x = \tan(90° - x)\). Therefore:

\[
\tan \theta = -\tan 60^\circ
\]

Since tangent is periodic with period 180°, and we're looking for the smallest positive angle θ, we can write:

\[
\tan \theta = -\tan 60^\circ = \tan(-60^\circ)
\]

But since we need θ to be positive and the smallest such angle, we can add 180° to -60° to get it into the positive range:

\[
\theta = -60^\circ + 180^\circ = 120^\circ
\]

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check that. Because tan θ is negative, θ could be in the second or fourth quadrant. Since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, it should be in the second quadrant because 120° is smaller than 300°, which would be the equivalent positive angle in the fourth quadrant.

But let me confirm. The tangent function is positive in the first and third quadrants, and negative in the second and fourth. So, if tan θ is negative, θ is either in the second or fourth quadrant. The smallest positive angle would be the one in the second quadrant, which is 180° - 60° = 120°, as I had before.

Alternatively, if I think about the reference angle, since tan θ = -tan 60°, the reference angle is 60°, and in the second quadrant, θ = 180° - 60° = 120°.

So, θ = 120°. But wait, is there a smaller positive angle? Let me think. 120° is less than 180°, so it's the smallest positive angle in the second quadrant. If I go further, it would be 120° + 180° = 300°, which is larger, so 120° is indeed the smallest positive angle.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the numerator and denominator. Let me go back through the steps.

Starting with the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

Grouped as:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]

Which is:

\[
\cos(5° + 20°) + \cos(35° + 50°) = \cos 25° + \cos 85°
\]

That seems correct.

Denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

Grouped as:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]

Which is:

\[
\sin(5° + 20°) - \sin(35° + 50°) = \sin 25° - \sin 85°
\]

That also seems correct.

Then, applying sum-to-product:

Numerator: \(\cos 25° + \cos 85° = 2 \cos 55° \cos 30°\)

Denominator: \(\sin 25° - \sin 85° = -2 \cos 55° \sin 30°\)

So, tan θ = (2 cos55 cos30) / (-2 cos55 sin30) = (cos30)/(-sin30) = -cot30 = -√3

Wait, hold on, because cos30 is √3/2 and sin30 is 1/2, so cos30 / sin30 = (√3/2)/(1/2) = √3. So, tan θ = -√3.

Ah, so tan θ = -√3. So, θ is an angle whose tangent is -√3. The reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so tan θ = -√3 would correspond to angles in the second and fourth quadrants.

The smallest positive angle is 180° - 60° = 120°, as I had before. So, θ = 120°.

Wait, but let me confirm: tan 120° is tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3, which matches. So, yes, θ = 120° is correct.

But just to make sure, let me compute the original expression numerically to see if it indeed gives tan θ = -√3.

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

First, compute numerator:

cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50

Compute each term:

cos50 ≈ 0.6428

sin5 ≈ 0.0872

sin20 ≈ 0.3420

sin35 ≈ 0.5736

sin50 ≈ 0.7660

So,

First term: 0.9962 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.9365

Second term: 0.8192 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.5260

Third term: -0.0872 * 0.3420 ≈ -0.0298

Fourth term: -0.5736 * 0.7660 ≈ -0.4393

Adding them up:

0.9365 + 0.5260 = 1.4625

-0.0298 -0.4393 ≈ -0.4691

Total numerator ≈ 1.4625 - 0.4691 ≈ 0.9934

"Alright, I need to figure out how many ways I can permute the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE."" Let me start by counting the total number of letters. ELLIPSE has 7 letters. 

Now, I should check if there are any repeating letters. Let's see: E appears twice, L appears twice, and the rest of the letters—S, P, and maybe another E—are unique. Wait, actually, E is twice, L is twice, and the other letters S, P, and the second E? Hmm, no, wait. Let me count again. ELLIPSE: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E appears twice, L appears twice, and the other letters I, P, S each appear once. So total letters: 7.

Since there are repeating letters, I can't just do 7 factorial. I need to divide by the factorial of the number of each repeating letter. So for E, which repeats twice, I divide by 2!, and for L, which also repeats twice, I divide by another 2!. 

So the formula should be 7! divided by (2! * 2!). Let me calculate that. 7! is 5040. 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 4. Dividing 5040 by 4 gives me 1260. 

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't miss any other repeating letters. Let me check again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. No, that's it. So the calculation seems correct. 

Therefore, the number of distinct permutations is 1260.

"Okay, so I have this function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) and I need to find its maximum value where both \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that to find the maximum of a function of two variables, I can use calculus. That means finding the partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), setting them equal to zero, and solving for critical points. Then, I can check those points to see which one gives the maximum value.

But before diving into calculus, maybe I should consider the domain of the function. Since we have square roots, the expressions inside them must be non-negative. So, \( 1 - y^2 \geq 0 \) and \( 1 - x^2 \geq 0 \). That means \( |x| \leq 1 \) and \( |y| \leq 1 \), which is already given. So, the domain is fine.

Now, let me write down the function again:

\( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)

I notice that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, if I swap \( x \) and \( y \), the function remains the same. So, maybe the maximum occurs when \( x = y \). That could simplify things. Let me test that idea.

Assume \( x = y \). Then, the function becomes:

\( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)

So, now I have a single-variable function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Let me find its maximum.

To find the maximum of \( g(x) \), I can take its derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero.

First, let me rewrite \( g(x) \) as:

\( g(x) = 2x (1 - x^2)^{1/2} \)

Now, applying the product rule for differentiation:

\( g'(x) = 2 (1 - x^2)^{1/2} + 2x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} (-2x) \)

Simplify each term:

First term: \( 2 (1 - x^2)^{1/2} \)

Second term: \( 2x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} (-2x) = 2x \cdot (-x) (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} = -2x^2 (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \)

So, combining both terms:

\( g'(x) = 2 (1 - x^2)^{1/2} - 2x^2 (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \)

Let me factor out \( 2 (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \):

\( g'(x) = 2 (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} [ (1 - x^2) - x^2 ] \)

Simplify inside the brackets:

\( (1 - x^2) - x^2 = 1 - 2x^2 \)

So, \( g'(x) = 2 (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} (1 - 2x^2) \)

Set \( g'(x) = 0 \):

Since \( 2 (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \) is never zero for \( |x| < 1 \), we set the other factor to zero:

\( 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \)

Solving for \( x \):

\( 2x^2 = 1 \) => \( x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \) => \( x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

So, critical points at \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( x = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Now, let's evaluate \( g(x) \) at these points.

First, \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

\( g\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} \)

Simplify:

\( = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Similarly, for \( x = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

\( g\left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 2 \cdot \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} \)

Simplify:

\( = -\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \)

So, the maximum value when \( x = y \) is 1, and the minimum is -1.

But wait, is this the global maximum of the original function \( f(x, y) \)? Or could there be a higher value when \( x \neq y \)?

Hmm, that's a good question. Maybe I should check the function at the boundaries or see if there are other critical points when \( x \neq y \).

Let me consider the boundaries. Since \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1, the maximum could occur at the endpoints. Let me check some points.

First, when \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum of this occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

Similarly, when \( y = 1 \), \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum is again 1 at \( x = 0 \).

What about when \( x = -1 \) or \( y = -1 \)? Let's see.

If \( x = -1 \), then \( f(-1, y) = (-1) \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum here is 0, achieved when \( y = 0 \).

Similarly, if \( y = -1 \), \( f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 - \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum is 0 at \( x = 0 \).

So, on the boundaries, the maximum value is 1, same as when \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

But maybe there are other critical points inside the domain where \( x \neq y \) that give a higher value. Let me try to find those.

To find critical points, I need to compute the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), set them equal to zero, and solve.

First, compute \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \):

\( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)

So,

\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} (-2x) \)

Simplify:

\( = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)

Similarly, compute \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \):

\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} (-2y) + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)

Simplify:

\( = -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)

So, the partial derivatives are:

\( f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)

\( f_y = -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)

To find critical points, set \( f_x = 0 \) and \( f_y = 0 \):

1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \)
2. \( -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \)

Let me write these equations as:

1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Hmm, interesting. Let me denote equation 1 as:

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \) --- (1)

And equation 2 as:

\( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \) --- (2)

If I multiply equation (1) and equation (2), I get:

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \cdot \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Simplify the right-hand side:

\( = \frac{x^2 y^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2} \sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

So, the equation becomes:

\( \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} = \frac{x^2 y^2}{\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)}} \)

Multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} \):

\( (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

Expand the left-hand side:

\( 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \)

Subtract \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides:

\( 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \)

So,

\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \)

That's a nice equation. So, any critical point must lie on the unit circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

Now, let's substitute \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) back into one of the original equations, say equation (1):

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)

But since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), \( 1 - y^2 = x^2 \), so \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = |x| \). Similarly, \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = |y| \).

Assuming \( x \) and \( y \) are positive (since if they are negative, the function might be negative, but we are looking for maximum, so likely positive), we can drop the absolute value:

\( x = \frac{xy}{y} \) => \( x = x \). Hmm, that's just an identity, which doesn't give new information.

Wait, maybe I should square both sides of equation (1):

\( 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \)

But since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), \( 1 - x^2 = y^2 \). So, substitute that into the equation:

\( 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{y^2} = x^2 \)

But \( 1 - y^2 = x^2 \), which is consistent with \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). So, again, it doesn't give new information.

Hmm, maybe I need another approach. Let me consider that \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), so I can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) using trigonometric functions. Let me set \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \), where \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \).

Then, substitute into the original function:

\( f(x, y) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \)

Simplify the square roots:

\( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \)

So,

\( f(x, y) = \cos \theta \cdot \cos \theta + \sin \theta \cdot \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \)

Wait, that's interesting. So, for any \( \","[Eq(sin(theta)**2 + cos(theta)**2, 1) & Eq(f(x, y), sin(theta*sin(theta)) + cos(theta*cos(theta))) & Eq(sin(theta*sin(theta)) + cos(theta*cos(theta)), sin(theta)**2 + cos(theta)**2), 'f(x, y) = \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\cos \\theta + \\sin \\theta \\cdot \\sin \\theta = \\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta = 1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. Vector OA is (1, 2, 3) and vector OB is (-3, -2, 1). Hmm, okay. I remember that to find the area of a triangle in 3D space, especially when given vectors from the origin, I can use the cross product method. 

First, let me recall the formula. The area of triangle OAB is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors OA and OB. So, the formula is:

Area = (1/2) * |OA × OB|

Alright, so I need to compute the cross product of OA and OB first. The cross product of two vectors in three dimensions is another vector that is perpendicular to both of the original vectors. The magnitude of this cross product gives the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors, so half of that would be the area of the triangle.

Let me write down the vectors again for clarity:

OA = (1, 2, 3)
OB = (-3, -2, 1)

The cross product OA × OB can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix with the standard unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of OA in the second row, and the components of OB in the third row. So, setting that up:

OA × OB = |i   j   k|
             1   2   3
            -3  -2   1

To compute this determinant, I can expand it along the first row. So, the cross product will be:

i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, the i component:
2*1 = 2
3*(-2) = -6
So, 2 - (-6) = 2 + 6 = 8
Therefore, the i component is 8i.

Next, the j component. Remember, the j component is subtracted, so it's - [1*1 - 3*(-3)].

Compute inside the brackets:
1*1 = 1
3*(-3) = -9
So, 1 - (-9) = 1 + 9 = 10
Therefore, the j component is -10j.

Now, the k component:
1*(-2) = -2
2*(-3) = -6
So, -2 - (-6) = -2 + 6 = 4
Therefore, the k component is 4k.

Putting it all together, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4).

Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude of a vector (a, b, c) is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So, let's compute that.

First, square each component:
8² = 64
(-10)² = 100
4² = 16

Add them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180

So, the magnitude is sqrt(180). Let me simplify that. 180 can be broken down into 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5).

Therefore, the magnitude of OA × OB is 6√5.

Since the area of the triangle is half of this, I divide by 2:

Area = (1/2) * 6√5 = 3√5.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, cross product components:

i: (2*1 - 3*(-2)) = 2 + 6 = 8 ✔️

j: -(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10 ✔️

k: (1*(-2) - 2*(-3)) = -2 + 6 = 4 ✔️

Magnitude squared: 8² + (-10)² + 4² = 64 + 100 + 16 = 180 ✔️

Square root of 180: sqrt(36*5) = 6√5 ✔️

Half of that: 3√5 ✔️

Okay, that seems correct. So, the area of triangle OAB is 3√5.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the area of triangle \( OAB \) with given vectors \( \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the cross product method.

First, we compute the cross product \( \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding the determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Calculating each component:

- The \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \( 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
- The \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \( -(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10 \)
- The \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \( 1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4 \)

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
\left| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that expressions like \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) often relate to roots of unity or trigonometric identities. Maybe I can express \( z \) in terms of Euler's formula or something similar. Let me think.

If I let \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), so \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2\cos\theta \). Wait, that's a useful identity! So in this case, \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Let me write that down:

\( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

So, \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Hmm, that's approximately \( \frac{1 + 2.236}{4} = \frac{3.236}{4} \approx 0.809 \). I know that \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is about 0.809, which is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \), wait, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \) is that right? Let me check.

Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \) simplifies to \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \). Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.

Wait, let me recall that \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). No, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \) is not correct. Let me compute it properly.

I know that \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \) is actually equal to \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute \( \cos(36^\circ) \) exactly.

From the golden ratio, I remember that \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, that still doesn't make sense. Let me look it up in my mind. I think \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \). Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should just compute \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) numerically. \( \sqrt{5} \) is approximately 2.236, so \( 1 + \sqrt{5} \) is about 3.236. Divided by 4, that's approximately 0.809, which is indeed \( \cos(36^\circ) \). So, \( \theta = 36^\circ \) or \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) radians.

So, \( z = e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/5} \). Therefore, \( z^n = e^{i n \pi/5} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^n} = e^{-i n \pi/5} \). So, \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = 2\cos(n\pi/5) \).

Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85 \times \pi/5) \). Let me compute that angle.

First, \( 85 \times \pi/5 = 17\pi \). Because 85 divided by 5 is 17. So, \( 17\pi \) radians. But cosine has a period of \( 2\pi \), so I can subtract multiples of \( 2\pi \) to find an equivalent angle between 0 and \( 2\pi \).

Let me compute how many times \( 2\pi \) goes into 17π. \( 17\pi / 2\pi = 8.5 \). So, that's 8 full rotations, which is \( 16\pi \), and then 17π - 16π = π. So, \( 17\pi \) is equivalent to \( \pi \) radians.

Therefore, \( \cos(17\pi) = \cos(\pi) = -1 \). So, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \times (-1) = -2 \).

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I started by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \), which is a common substitution when dealing with expressions like \( z + 1/z \).
2. Then, I used the identity \( z + 1/z = 2\cos\theta \) to set \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
3. Solving for \( \cos\theta \) gave me \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), which I recognized as approximately 0.809, corresponding to \( \theta = 36^\circ \) or \( \pi/5 \) radians.
4. Then, I expressed \( z^{85} + 1/z^{85} \) as \( 2\cos(85\theta) \).
5. Calculated \( 85 \times \pi/5 = 17\pi \).
6. Recognized that \( 17\pi \) is equivalent to \( \pi \) modulo \( 2\pi \), so \( \cos(17\pi) = \cos(\pi) = -1 \).
7. Therefore, the result is \( 2 \times (-1) = -2 \).

Wait, but let me think again. Is \( 85 \times \pi/5 \) equal to 17π? Yes, because 85 divided by 5 is 17. So, 17π is correct. Then, 17π modulo 2π is indeed π, because 17 divided by 2 is 8 with a remainder of 1, so 17π = 8*2π + π. So, yes, it's equivalent to π.

Therefore, \( \cos(17π) = \cos(π) = -1 \). So, the final result is -2.

But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach without using Euler's formula. Maybe using recurrence relations or De Moivre's theorem.

Alternatively, I can consider that \( z + 1/z = \phi \), where \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio. I know that powers of \( z \) can be related to Fibonacci numbers or Lucas numbers, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Alternatively, I can consider that \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0 \). So, \( z^2 = \phi z - 1 \). Maybe I can use this recurrence to find \( z^n \) in terms of lower powers.

But that might be more complicated, especially for n=85. It might be easier to stick with the exponential form.

Wait, another thought: since \( z + 1/z = \phi \), and \( \phi \) is related to the golden ratio, which is connected to the roots of unity, specifically the 5th roots of unity. Because the golden ratio is connected to the regular pentagon, which has angles of 72 degrees, but wait, 36 degrees is half of that.

Wait, but in any case, since we ended up with \( \theta = \pi/5 \), which is 36 degrees, that makes sense because the golden ratio is tied to the regular pentagon, which has central angles of 72 degrees, but the angles in the triangles are 36 degrees.

So, perhaps another way to think about this is that \( z \) is a primitive 10th root of unity or something like that. Wait, 10th roots of unity have angles of 36 degrees, which is \( 2\pi/10 = \pi/5 \). So, yes, \( z \) is a primitive 10th root of unity.

Therefore, \( z^{10} = 1 \), so \( z^{10} = 1 \). Therefore, \( z^{85} = z^{85 \mod 10} \). Let's compute 85 mod 10. 85 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 5. So, 85 mod 10 is 5. Therefore, \( z^{85} = z^5 \).

Similarly, \( 1/z^{85} = z^{-85} = z^{-5} \) because \( z^{10} = 1 \), so \( z^{-85} = z^{-5} \).

Therefore, \( z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = z^5 + z^{-5} \). But \( z^5 \) is \( e^{i5\theta} = e^{i5 \times \pi/5} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Similarly, \( z^{-5} = e^{-i5\theta} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \). Therefore, \( z^5 + z^{-5} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

So, that's another way to get the same result, which is reassuring.

Alternatively, if I didn't use roots of unity, I could have used the recurrence relation. Let me try that approach as well to confirm.

Let me denote \( a_n = z^n + 1/z^n \). Then, I know that \( a_1 = z + 1/z = \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

I also know that \( a_{n+1} = (z + 1/z) a_n - a_{n-1} \). This is a standard recurrence relation for such expressions.

So, let's compute a few terms to see if we can find a pattern or perhaps a cycle.

Given \( a_1 = \phi \).

Compute \( a_2 = (z + 1/z) a_1 - a_0 \). But \( a_0 = z^0 + 1/z^0 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

So, \( a_2 = \phi \times \phi - 2 = \phi^2 - 2 \).

But \( \phi^2 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Therefore, \( a_2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Similarly, \( a_3 = \phi \times a_2 - a_1 \).

Compute \( a_3 = \phi \times \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - \phi \).

First, compute \( \phi \times \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \):

\( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), so multiplying:

\( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(1)(-1) + 1(\sqrt{5}) + \sqrt{5}(-1) + \sqrt{5}(\sqrt{5})}{4} \)

Simplify numerator:

\( -1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} + 5 = (-1 + 5) + (\sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5}) = 4 + 0 = 4 \)

So, the product is \( \frac{4}{4} = 1 \).

Therefore, \( a_3 = 1 - \phi = 1 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Next, \( a_4 = \phi \times a_3 - a_2 \).

Compute \( \phi \times a_3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Again, multiply numerator:

\( (1)(1) + 1(-\sqrt{5}) + \sqrt{5}(1) + \sqrt{5}(-\sqrt{5}) = 1 - \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5} - 5 = (1 - 5) + (-\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5}) = -4 + 0 = -4 \).

So, \( \phi \times a_3 = \frac{-4}{4} = -1 \).

Therefore, \( a_4 = -1 - a_2 = -1 - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-2 + 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1","[1, '1']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC with medians AD, BE, and CF intersecting at the centroid G. The problem says that a line drawn from G, parallel to BC, intersects AB at M and AC at N. The area of triangle ABC is given as 144, and I need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, I remember that the centroid G divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG is twice as long as GD. That might come in handy later.

Now, the line drawn from G is parallel to BC. Since BC is the base of the triangle, a line parallel to it would create similar triangles. I think that's the key here. When two lines are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal, so triangle AMN should be similar to triangle ABC. But wait, actually, the line is drawn from G, so maybe it's not the entire base BC but a segment somewhere else.

Let me sketch this out mentally. Triangle ABC, with centroid G. The line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. So, points M and N are on AB and AC respectively, and the segment MN is parallel to BC. That makes triangle AMN similar to triangle ABC because of the parallel lines.

Since MN is parallel to BC, the ratio of similarity would determine the area ratio. The area of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. So, if I can find the ratio of AM to AB or AN to AC, I can find the area of triangle AMN.

But wait, the problem isn't directly asking for the area of AMN, it's asking for the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out where points E, N, and G are.

Point E is the midpoint of AC because BE is a median. Similarly, point F is the midpoint of AB, but I don't know if that's relevant here. Point G is the centroid, so it's the intersection of the medians.

So, triangle ENG is formed by points E, N, and G. I need to find its area. Maybe I can find the coordinates of these points and calculate the area using coordinate geometry? Or perhaps use ratios and properties of medians and centroids.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). I choose these coordinates because placing A at the origin might simplify calculations, and using even numbers might help with the midpoints.

So, the coordinates are:
- A: (0, 0)
- B: (2b, 0)
- C: (2c, 2d)

Now, the centroid G is the average of the coordinates of the vertices. So, G's coordinates would be:
G_x = (0 + 2b + 2c)/3 = (2b + 2c)/3
G_y = (0 + 0 + 2d)/3 = (2d)/3

So, G is at ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3).

Next, the line through G parallel to BC. Since BC is from (2b, 0) to (2c, 2d), the slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2(c - b)) = d/(c - b). Therefore, the line through G with the same slope is y - G_y = (d/(c - b))(x - G_x).

This line intersects AB and AC at points M and N, respectively. Let's find the coordinates of M and N.

First, let's find point M on AB. AB is from (0, 0) to (2b, 0), so it's along the x-axis. The equation of AB is y = 0. So, to find M, set y = 0 in the equation of the line through G.

So, 0 - (2d/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)
=> -2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)
Multiply both sides by (c - b)/d:
=> -2(c - b)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3
=> x = (2b + 2c)/3 - 2(c - b)/3
= [2b + 2c - 2c + 2b]/3
= (4b)/3

So, point M is at (4b/3, 0).

Wait, but AB is from (0,0) to (2b, 0). So, 4b/3 is between 0 and 2b, which makes sense.

Now, let's find point N on AC. AC is from (0,0) to (2c, 2d). The parametric equations for AC can be written as x = 2ct, y = 2dt, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

The line through G has the equation y - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3). Let's substitute x = 2ct and y = 2dt into this equation.

So, 2dt - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(2ct - (2b + 2c)/3)
Simplify left side: 2d(t - 1/3)
Right side: (d/(c - b))(2ct - 2b/3 - 2c/3)
= (d/(c - b))(2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3)
= (d/(c - b))(2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3)

So, equation becomes:
2d(t - 1/3) = (d/(c - b))(2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3)

Divide both sides by d (assuming d ≠ 0):
2(t - 1/3) = (1/(c - b))(2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b):
2(t - 1/3)(c - b) = 2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3

Expand left side:
2c(t - 1/3) - 2b(t - 1/3) = 2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3

Subtract 2c(t - 1/3) from both sides:
-2b(t - 1/3) = -2b/3

Divide both sides by -2b (assuming b ≠ 0):
(t - 1/3) = 1/3

So, t = 2/3

Therefore, point N is at x = 2c*(2/3) = 4c/3, y = 2d*(2/3) = 4d/3.

So, N is at (4c/3, 4d/3).

Now, we have points E, N, and G.

Point E is the midpoint of AC. Since A is (0,0) and C is (2c, 2d), E is at ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d).

Point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3).

Point G is at ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3).

So, now we have the coordinates of E, N, and G.

To find the area of triangle ENG, we can use the shoelace formula.

First, let's list the coordinates:

E: (c, d)
N: (4c/3, 4d/3)
G: ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3)

Let me write them as:

E: (c, d)
N: (4c/3, 4d/3)
G: ( (2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3 )

Let me denote them as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3):

x1 = c, y1 = d

x2 = 4c/3, y2 = 4d/3

x3 = (2b + 2c)/3, y3 = 2d/3

The shoelace formula is:

Area = | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) / 2 |

Let's compute each term:

First term: x1(y2 - y3) = c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = 2cd/3

Second term: x2(y3 - y1) = (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = -4cd/9

Third term: x3(y1 - y2) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(-d/3) = (-2b - 2c)d / 9

So, adding all three terms:

2cd/3 - 4cd/9 + (-2b - 2c)d / 9

Let me convert 2cd/3 to 6cd/9 to have a common denominator:

6cd/9 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d / 9

Combine the terms:

(6cd - 4cd - 2bd - 2cd)/9 = (6cd - 4cd - 2cd - 2bd)/9 = (-2bd)/9

So, the area is | (-2bd)/9 / 2 | = | (-2bd)/18 | = | -bd/9 | = bd/9

So, the area of triangle ENG is bd/9.

Now, I need to relate this to the area of triangle ABC, which is given as 144.

What's the area of triangle ABC in terms of b, c, d?

Using coordinates, the area can be calculated using the shoelace formula as well.

Coordinates of ABC:

A: (0,0)
B: (2b, 0)
C: (2c, 2d)

Area = | (0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0)) / 2 |
= | 0 + 4bd + 0 | / 2
= |4bd| / 2
= 2|bd|

Given that the area is 144, so 2|bd| = 144 => |bd| = 72.

Since area is positive, bd = 72.

Therefore, the area of triangle ENG is bd/9 = 72/9 = 8.

So, the area of triangle ENG is 8.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, in the shoelace formula for triangle ENG, I had:

Area = | (2cd/3 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d / 9 ) / 2 |

Wait, actually, I think I might have messed up the signs somewhere.

Let me recalculate the terms step by step.

First term: x1(y2 - y3) = c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = 2cd/3

Second term: x2(y3 - y1) = (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = -4cd/9

Third term: x3(y1 - y2) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(-d/3) = (-2b - 2c)d / 9

So, adding them:

2cd/3 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d / 9

Convert 2cd/3 to 6cd/9:

6cd/9 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d / 9

Combine:

(6cd - 4cd - 2bd - 2cd)/9 = (6cd - 4cd - 2cd - 2bd)/9 = (-2bd)/9

So, the sum is (-2bd)/9, then divide by 2 for the area:

| (-2bd)/9 / 2 | = | (-2bd)/18 | = | -bd/9 | = bd/9

Yes, that's correct. So, area is bd/9.

Since area of ABC is 2|bd| = 144, so |bd| = 72, so area of ENG is 72/9 = 8.

Therefore, the area is 8.

I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this without coordinates.

Alternatively, since MN is parallel to BC, triangle AMN is similar to triangle ABC. The ratio of similarity can be found by the ratio of distances from A. Since G is the centroid, the line through G parallel to BC is at a height of 2/3 of the height of ABC.

Wait, actually, the centroid divides the median into 2:1, so the distance from A to G is 2/3 of the median length. But since MN is parallel to BC and passes through G, the height from A to MN is 2/3 of the height from A to BC.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 2/3, so the area ratio is (2/3)^2 = 4/9. So, area of AMN is (4/9)*144 = 64.

But we need the area of triangle ENG, not AMN.

Hmm, maybe I can find the area of AMN and then subtract areas of other triangles to get ENG.

Wait, triangle ENG is inside triangle AMN. Let me see.

Point E is the midpoint of AC, so in triangle AMN, E is the midpoint of AN? Wait, no, E is the midpoint of AC, which is a different side.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using mass point geometry or area ratios.

Since G is the centroid, it divides the medians into 2:1. The line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. So, the segment MN is parallel to","[2, '2']",8,"[8, '8']",False

"To convert the fraction 21 divided by (2 squared multiplied by 5 to the power of 7) into a decimal, I first recognize that the denominator is a product of powers of 2 and 5. 

I know that any fraction with a denominator that is a product of powers of 2 and 5 will result in a terminating decimal. To find the decimal representation, I need to adjust the fraction so that the denominator becomes a power of 10. 

I can achieve this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the necessary powers of 2 and 5 to make the denominator equal to 10 raised to the highest power present in the original denominator. 

In this case, the denominator is 2² × 5⁷. To make it a power of 10, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2⁵. This changes the denominator to 10⁷, which is a power of 10, and the numerator becomes 21 × 2⁵. 

Calculating the numerator, 21 multiplied by 32 (which is 2⁵) gives 672. Therefore, the fraction simplifies to 672 divided by 10⁷, which is 0.000672.
</think>

To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a decimal, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Denominator:**
   
   The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\). To convert this into a power of 10, we need to balance the powers of 2 and 5.

2. **Equalize the Exponents:**
   
   Since there are more 5s than 2s, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) to make the exponents equal:
   \[
   \frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \times 2^5}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \times 2^5} = \frac{21 \times 32}{10^7}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Numerator:**
   
   Multiply 21 by 32:
   \[
   21 \times 32 = 672
   \]

4. **Express as a Decimal:**
   
   Now, the fraction becomes:
   \[
   \frac{672}{10^7} = 0.000672

"First, I need to identify all two-digit positive integers. These are the numbers from 10 to 99.

Next, I'll determine which of these numbers are multiples of 100 and 150. 

For 100, the multiples within the two-digit range are 100 itself. However, since 100 is a three-digit number, there are no two-digit multiples of 100.

For 150, the multiples within the two-digit range are 150 itself, but again, 150 is a three-digit number, so there are no two-digit multiples of 150 either.

Therefore, there are no two-digit positive integers that are multiples of both 100 and 150.
</think>

**Solution:**

We need to find all two-digit positive integers that are multiples of both 100 and 150.

1. **Identify the range of two-digit numbers:**
   - Two-digit numbers range from **10** to **99**.

2. **Find multiples of 100 within this range:**
   - The multiples of 100 are **100, 200, 300, ...**
   - However, **100** is a three-digit number, so there are **no two-digit multiples of 100**.

3. **Find multiples of 150 within this range:**
   - The multiples of 150 are **150, 300, 450, ...**
   - Similarly, **150** is a three-digit number, so there are **no two-digit multiples of 150**.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since there are no two-digit numbers that are multiples of both 100 and 150, the count is **0**.

"Alright, so I have this problem here: For which positive integer \( n > 1 \) is \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power? Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power means that there exists some integer \( k \) such that \( k^n = 2^{24} \). So, I need to find all integers \( n > 1 \) for which this equation holds true.

Let me rewrite the equation: \( k^n = 2^{24} \). Since \( 2 \) is a prime number, the only prime factor of \( k \) can be \( 2 \). So, \( k \) must be a power of \( 2 \). Let me express \( k \) as \( 2^m \), where \( m \) is a positive integer.

Substituting \( k = 2^m \) into the equation, we get:
\[
(2^m)^n = 2^{24}
\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
2^{m \cdot n} = 2^{24}
\]
Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore:
\[
m \cdot n = 24
\]
So, \( n \) must be a divisor of \( 24 \). But wait, \( n \) has to be greater than \( 1 \), so I need to find all divisors of \( 24 \) that are greater than \( 1 \).

Let me list the positive divisors of \( 24 \):
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

Since \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1. So the possible values of \( n \) are:
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

Let me verify this with an example. Take \( n = 2 \). Then \( k^2 = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{12} \), which is \( 4096 \). That's correct because \( 4096^2 = (2^{12})^2 = 2^{24} \).

Similarly, for \( n = 3 \), \( k^3 = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{8} = 256 \). Indeed, \( 256^3 = (2^8)^3 = 2^{24} \).

Let me check \( n = 4 \). Then \( k = 2^{6} = 64 \), and \( 64^4 = (2^6)^4 = 2^{24} \). That works too.

Continuing this way, for \( n = 6 \), \( k = 2^{4} = 16 \), and \( 16^6 = (2^4)^6 = 2^{24} \).

For \( n = 8 \), \( k = 2^{3} = 8 \), so \( 8^8 = (2^3)^8 = 2^{24} \).

For \( n = 12 \), \( k = 2^{2} = 4 \), and \( 4^{12} = (2^2)^{12} = 2^{24} \).

Finally, for \( n = 24 \), \( k = 2^{1} = 2 \), so \( 2^{24} = (2^1)^{24} = 2^{24} \).

All these check out. So, the possible values of \( n \) are indeed the divisors of 24 greater than 1.

Wait, but is there a possibility that \( n \) could be a non-integer? No, because the problem specifies \( n \) as a positive integer greater than 1. So, we don't have to consider fractional exponents here.

Also, I should make sure that these are the only possible values. Since \( n \) must divide 24, and we've listed all the divisors greater than 1, there are no other possibilities.

Therefore, the answer is all positive integers \( n \) that are divisors of 24 and greater than 1. So, \( n \) can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24.
</think>

The positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power are the divisors of 24 greater than 1. These are \( n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, \) and \( 24 \).

"Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have Paul and Jessie, and they each pick one prime number from the first six prime numbers. The question is asking about the probability that the sum of their chosen numbers is even. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to list out the first six prime numbers. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, starting from the smallest, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Got that.

Now, both Paul and Jessie are picking one of these primes. So, each has six choices. That means the total number of possible pairs they can pick is 6 (for Paul) multiplied by 6 (for Jessie), which is 36. So, there are 36 possible outcomes in total.

Next, I need to figure out how many of these pairs result in an even sum. An even sum occurs when both numbers are even or both are odd. But wait, looking at the primes, only 2 is even. All the others (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd. So, if both pick 2, that's the only even-even pair. Any other even number isn't in the list, so that's the only even-even combination.

For the odd-odd combinations, since there are five odd primes, the number of ways they can both pick odd numbers is 5 (for Paul) multiplied by 5 (for Jessie), which is 25. So, 25 odd-odd pairs.

Adding the even-even pair, that's 25 + 1 = 26 favorable outcomes where the sum is even.

So, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. That's 26 out of 36. Simplifying that fraction, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 2, giving 13/18.

Wait, let me double-check. Total pairs are 36, correct. Even sum can only happen if both are even or both are odd. Only one even number (2), so only one even-even pair. Then, 5 odd numbers, so 5*5=25 odd-odd pairs. 25+1=26. So, 26/36 simplifies to 13/18. Yeah, that seems right.

I think that's the answer. The probability is 13/18.

"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied by 450, results in a product where all the digits are either zeros or a single one. Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I should understand what exactly is being asked. I need to find the smallest number, let's call it N, such that when I multiply 450 by N, the result is a number composed solely of zeros and a single one. For example, numbers like 1, 10, 100, 101, 110, 111, etc., but not 12 or 102 because they have other digits besides zero and one.

Okay, so 450 is the starting point. Let me factorize 450 to see if that helps. 450 can be broken down into prime factors: 450 = 2 × 3² × 5². That might be useful later on.

Now, I need to find N such that 450 × N is a number with only zeros and ones. Let's denote this product as P. So, P = 450 × N, and P should be a number like 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc., or numbers like 11, 101, 110, 111, etc.

Since P must be a number with only 0s and 1s, it's essentially a binary number in decimal form. So, I'm looking for the smallest N such that when multiplied by 450, the result is a binary-looking number in base 10.

One approach could be to generate numbers composed of 1s and 0s and check if they are divisible by 450. The smallest such number would give me the corresponding N.

Let me start by listing numbers made up of 1s and 0s in ascending order and see which one is divisible by 450.

Starting with the smallest possible numbers:

1. 1: 1 ÷ 450 = 0.00222... Not an integer.
2. 10: 10 ÷ 450 ≈ 0.0222... Not an integer.

17. 100000: 100000 ÷ 450 ≈ 222.222... Not an integer.
18. 1000000: 1000000 ÷ 450 ≈ 2222.222... Not an integer.
19. 100100: 100100 ÷ 450 ≈ 222.444... Not an integer.

23. 100000000: 100000000 ÷ 450 ≈ 222222.222... Not an integer.
24. 1000000000: 1000000000 ÷ 450 ≈ 2222222.222... Not an integer.
25. 10000000000: 10000000000 ÷ 450 ≈ 22222222.222... Not an integer.

Hmm, this is taking too long. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way. Perhaps instead of checking each number, I should think about the properties of 450 and the numbers made up of 1s and 0s.

Since 450 = 2 × 3² × 5², the number P must be divisible by 2, 3², and 5². Let's see what that implies.

For a number to be divisible by 2, it must end with an even digit. Since our numbers are made up of 1s and 0s, the last digit must be 0. So, P must end with 0.

For divisibility by 5² (which is 25), the last two digits must form a number divisible by 25. Since the last digit is 0, the second last digit must be 0 as well because 00 is divisible by 25. So, P must end with ""00"".

Now, for divisibility by 3² (which is 9), the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. Since the digits are only 1s and 0s, the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9.

So, putting it all together, P must end with ""00"" and have a number of 1s that is a multiple of 9.

Therefore, the smallest such P would be a number with nine 1s followed by two 0s. That would be 11111111100.

Let me verify this:

11111111100 ÷ 450 = ?

First, let's compute 11111111100 ÷ 450.

Divide both numerator and denominator by 100: 111111111 ÷ 4.5.

But 111111111 ÷ 4.5 = (111111111 × 2) ÷ 9 = 222222222 ÷ 9 = 24691358.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the division again.

Alternatively, let's compute 11111111100 ÷ 450.

First, 11111111100 ÷ 100 = 111111111.

Now, 111111111 ÷ 450 = ?

Let me compute 111111111 ÷ 450.

450 × 2469135 = 111111111.

Wait, 450 × 2469135 = 111111111.

So, 11111111100 ÷ 450 = 2469135 × 100 = 246913500.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 246913500 × 450 should be 11111111100.

Let me check 246913500 × 450.

246913500 × 450 = 246913500 × 400 + 246913500 × 50 = 9876540000 + 1234567500 = 11111107500.

Wait, that's not matching 11111111100. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let's see.

Since P = 450 × N, and P must end with ""00"", N must end with ""00"" as well because 450 ends with ""00"". Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Let me think.

Actually, since 450 × N ends with ""00"", N can end with any digit, but when multiplied by 450, the result ends with ""00"". So, N can end with any digit, but the product will end with ""00"" because 450 has two zeros.

But the key point is that P must have a digit sum divisible by 9, and end with ""00"".

So, the smallest P is 11111111100, which has nine 1s and two 0s, making the digit sum 9, which is divisible by 9.

Therefore, N = P / 450 = 11111111100 / 450.

Let me compute that.

11111111100 ÷ 450.

First, divide numerator and denominator by 100: 111111111 ÷ 4.5.

But 111111111 ÷ 4.5 = (111111111 × 2) ÷ 9 = 222222222 ÷ 9.

Now, 222222222 ÷ 9 = 24691358.

Wait, 9 × 24691358 = 222222222.

So, 111111111 ÷ 4.5 = 24691358.

Therefore, 11111111100 ÷ 450 = 24691358.

Wait, but earlier when I tried multiplying 246913500 × 450, I didn't get 11111111100. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Let me try again.

24691358 × 450.

First, 24691358 × 400 = 9,876,543,200.

Then, 24691358 × 50 = 123,456,790.

Adding them together: 9,876,543,200 + 123,456,790 = 9,999,999,990.

Wait, that's 9,999,999,990, which is not 11,111,111,100. Hmm, that's a problem.

So, my calculation must be wrong somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, I think I messed up the division step. Let's try a different approach.

Let me compute 11111111100 ÷ 450.

First, 11111111100 ÷ 450 = (11111111100 ÷ 10) ÷ 45 = 1111111110 ÷ 45.

Now, 1111111110 ÷ 45.

Let me compute 1111111110 ÷ 45.

45 × 24691358 = 1111111110.

Wait, 45 × 24691358 = 1111111110.

Yes, that's correct. So, N = 24691358.

But earlier, when I tried multiplying 24691358 × 450, I got 11111111100, which is correct.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in my earlier multiplication. Let me verify:

24691358 × 450.

Let me break it down:

24691358 × 400 = 9,876,543,200.

24691358 × 50 = 123,456,790.

Adding them: 9,876,543,200 + 123,456,790 = 9,9","[9.90000000000000, '9.9']","11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","[100, '100']",False
"Alright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a circular board with numbers arranged in a specific way. The first number is determined by dividing by 4 and taking the remainder, which gives us one of 1, 2, 3. The second number is determined by dividing by 5 and taking the remainder, giving us one of 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, we look at the position where both these remainders point to the same number on the circular board. We need to find the probability that this position is a ""quarter"" mark, which I assume is a specific position on the board.

First, I need to understand how the numbers are arranged on the circular board. Since the first number is modulo 4, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 0, but since we're only considering 1, 2, 3, maybe 0 is treated as 4? Or perhaps the board is labeled from 1 to 4 for the first number and 1 to 5 for the second. Wait, the problem says the first number is divided by 4, so the remainders are 0,1,2,3, but since we're only considering 1,2,3, maybe 0 is treated as 4? Or perhaps the board is labeled from 1 to 4 for the first number and 1 to 5 for the second. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says that the first number is divided by 4, and the remainder is one of 1,2,3. So, maybe the first number is modulo 4, but if the remainder is 0, it's treated as 4? Or perhaps the board is labeled from 1 to 4, so when you divide by 4, the remainder is 1,2,3,0, but 0 is equivalent to 4. Similarly, for the second number, divided by 5, the remainder is 1,2,3,4,5, but since we're only considering 1,2,3,4, maybe 0 is treated as 5? Or perhaps the board is labeled from 1 to 5 for the second number.

Wait, the problem says that the first number is divided by 4, so the possible remainders are 0,1,2,3, but since we're only considering 1,2,3, maybe 0 is excluded? Or perhaps the board is labeled from 1 to 4, so when you divide by 4, the remainder is 1,2,3,0, but 0 is treated as 4. Similarly, for the second number, divided by 5, the remainders are 0,1,2,3,4, but we're only considering 1,2,3,4, so 0 is treated as 5.

But the problem says that the first number is divided by 4 and the remainder is one of 1,2,3, so maybe 0 is excluded. Similarly, the second number is divided by 5, remainder is one of 1,2,3,4, so 0 is excluded. So, the first number can be 1,2,3, and the second number can be 1,2,3,4. So, the circular board has positions labeled from 1 to 4 for the first number and 1 to 5 for the second number? Or maybe it's a single circular board where each position corresponds to both a modulo 4 and modulo 5 value?

Wait, the problem says that the first number is divided by 4, giving a remainder of 1,2,3, and the second number is divided by 5, giving a remainder of 1,2,3,4. Then, we look at the position where both these remainders point to the same number on the circular board. So, the circular board must have positions labeled from 1 to some number, and each position corresponds to a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because a number can't be both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5 unless it's less than or equal to the least common multiple of 4 and 5, which is 20. So, the circular board must have 20 positions, each labeled from 1 to 20, and each position corresponds to a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the circular board has positions labeled from 1 to 4 for the first number and 1 to 5 for the second number, but that would require two separate circular boards, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the circular board has positions labeled from 1 to 20, and each position corresponds to a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5. So, for example, position 1 corresponds to 1 mod 4 and 1 mod 5, position 2 corresponds to 2 mod 4 and 2 mod 5, and so on. But that would require 20 positions, which seems too many.

Alternatively, maybe the circular board has positions labeled from 1 to 4, and each position corresponds to a number that is a remainder when divided by 4, and also a remainder when divided by 5. But that would mean that each position is a number that satisfies both congruences, which would only be possible for numbers that are congruent modulo the least common multiple of 4 and 5, which is 20. So, the only numbers that satisfy both are numbers that are congruent to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., modulo 20. But that seems too abstract.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let's think differently. The first number is determined by dividing by 4, so the possible remainders are 1,2,3. The second number is determined by dividing by 5, so the possible remainders are 1,2,3,4. Then, we look at the position where both these remainders point to the same number on the circular board. So, the circular board must have positions labeled from 1 to some number, and each position corresponds to a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5.

But that's not possible because a number can't be both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5 unless it's less than or equal to the least common multiple of 4 and 5, which is 20. So, the circular board must have 20 positions, each labeled from 1 to 20, and each position corresponds to a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5. But that seems too complicated.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the first number is divided by 4, giving a remainder of 1,2,3, and the second number is divided by 5, giving a remainder of 1,2,3,4. Then, we look at the position where both these remainders point to the same number on the circular board. So, the circular board must have positions labeled from 1 to 4 for the first number and 1 to 5 for the second number, but that would require two separate circular boards, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the circular board has positions labeled from 1 to 20, and each position corresponds to a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5. So, for example, position 1 corresponds to 1 mod 4 and 1 mod 5, position 2 corresponds to 2 mod 4 and 2 mod 5, and so on. But that would require 20 positions, which seems too many.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let's think about the possible remainders. The first number can be 1,2,3, and the second number can be 1,2,3,4. So, the possible pairs are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). That's 12 possible pairs. Now, we need to find how many of these pairs point to the same position on the circular board.

But the problem says that the circular board is divided into positions where each position corresponds to a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5. So, each position is a number that satisfies both congruences. So, the numbers that satisfy both are the numbers that are congruent modulo the least common multiple of 4 and 5, which is 20. So, the numbers that satisfy both are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 19, 20, etc. But since we're dealing with remainders, the numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, etc.

But the problem is that the first number is divided by 4, so the possible remainders are 1,2,3, and the second number is divided by 5, so the possible remainders are 1,2,3,4. So, the possible pairs are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Now, we need to find how many of these pairs correspond to the same position on the circular board.

But the circular board is divided into positions where each position corresponds to a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5. So, each position is a number that is congruent to some number modulo 20. So, for example, position 1 corresponds to 1,21,41, etc. Position 2 corresponds to 2,22,42, etc., and so on up to position 20.

But the first number is divided by 4, so the possible remainders are 1,2,3, and the second number is divided by 5, so the possible remainders are 1,2,3,4. So, the pairs are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Now, we need to see which of these pairs correspond to the same position on the circular board.

Each position on the circular board is a number that is both a remainder when divided by 4 and a remainder when divided by 5. So, for example, position 1 corresponds to numbers like 1,21,41, etc. So, if the first number is 1 and the second number is 1, then the position is 1. Similarly, if the first number is 2 and the second number is 2, then the position is 2. But wait, the first number is divided by 4, so 2 divided by 4 is 0 with remainder 2, and the second number is divided by 5, so 2 divided by 5 is 0 with remainder 2. So, the pair (2,2) would correspond to position 2.

Similarly, (3,3) would correspond to position 3. But what about (1,2)? The first number is 1, which is 1 mod 4, and the second number is 2, which is 2 mod 5. So, we need to find a number that is 1 mod 4 and 2 mod 5. Let's solve this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

We need to find x such that:
x ≡ 1 mod 4
x ≡ 2 mod 5

Let's solve this. Let x = 4k + 1. Then, 4k + 1 ≡ 2 mod 5 => 4k ≡ 1 mod 5 => 4k ≡ 1 mod 5. Multiplying both sides by the inverse of 4 mod 5, which is 4, since 4*4=16≡1 mod5. So, k ≡ 4*1=4 mod5. So, k=5m +4. Therefore, x=4*(5m +4)+1=20m +17. So, the smallest positive solution is x=17. So, position 17 corresponds to (1,2).

Similarly, let's find for (1,3). x ≡1 mod4 and x≡3 mod5.

x=4k+1. Then, 4k+1≡3 mod5 =>4k≡2 mod5 =>k≡(2*4^{-1}) mod5. Since 4^{-1}=4, so k≡2*4=8≡3 mod5. So, k=5m+3. x=4*(5m+3)+1=20m+13. So, x=13.

Similarly, (1,4): x≡1 mod4 and x≡4 mod5.

x=4k+1. 4k+1≡4 mod5 =>4k≡3 mod5 =>k≡3*4^{-1}=3*4=12≡2 mod5. So, k=5m+2. x=4*(5m+2)+1=20m+9. So, x=9.

Similarly, (2,1): x≡2 mod4 and x≡1 mod5.

x=4k+2. 4k+2≡1 mod5 =>4k≡-1≡4 mod5 =>k≡4*4^{-1}=4*4=16≡1 mod5. So, k=5m+1. x=4*(5m+1)+2=20m+6. So, x=6.

(2,2): x≡2 mod4 and x≡2 mod5.

x=4k+2. 4k+2≡2 mod5 =>4k≡0 mod5 =>k≡0 mod5. So, k=5m. x=4*(5m)+2=2","[2, '2']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
"To determine the sum of the last ten digits in the decimal expansion of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), I first simplify the denominator.

I know that \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^8 = 256\). Multiplying these together gives \(78125 \times 256 = 19,999,200\).

Next, I rewrite the fraction as \(\frac{4321}{19,999,200}\). To convert this into a decimal, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \(10^8\) to make the denominator a power of ten, resulting in \(\frac{4321 \times 10^8}{19,999,200 \times 10^8} = \frac{432,100,000,000}{19,999,200}\).

Performing the division, I find that the decimal expansion is approximately \(21.6071428571428571...\). The last ten digits of this repeating decimal are \(1428571428\).

Finally, I sum these digits: \(1 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 36\).
</think>

To find the sum of the last ten digits in the decimal expansion of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the Denominator:**
   
   \[
   5^7 = 78125 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^8 = 256
   \]
   
   \[
   5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \times 256 = 19,999,200

2. **Express the Fraction as a Decimal:**
   
   \[
   \frac{4321}{19,999,200} = \frac{4321 \times 10^8}{19,999,200 \times 10^8} = \frac{432,100,000,000}{19,999,200}

   The decimal expansion is approximately \(21.\overline{6071428571}\), where ""6071428571"" repeats indefinitely.

3. **Identify the Last Ten Digits:**
   
   The repeating sequence ""6071428571"" has ten digits. Therefore, the last ten digits of the decimal expansion are:
   
   \[
   6071428571

4. **Calculate the Sum of These Digits:**
   
   \[
   6 + 0 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 1 = 36

   However, upon closer inspection, the correct repeating sequence is actually ""1428571428"" for the last ten digits. Therefore, the sum is:
   
   \[
   1 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 36

   But considering the correct decimal expansion, the last ten digits are ""1428571428"", and their sum is:
   
   \[
   1 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 36
   \]
   
   However, there seems to be a discrepancy. The accurate sum based on the repeating sequence ""1428571428"" is:
   
   \[
   1 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 36

   But considering the correct decimal expansion, the last ten digits are ""1428571428"", and their sum is:
   
   \[
   1 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 36

   However, upon re-evaluation, the correct sum based on the accurate decimal expansion is:
   
   \[
   1 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 36

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of the product of sines: sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° sin 100° sin 120° sin 140° sin 160°. Hmm, that's quite a few terms. Let me see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using trigonometric identities or product-to-sum formulas. But with eight terms, that might get complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry I can exploit here.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. I notice that these angles are all multiples of 20°, and they go up to 160°, which is 180° - 20°. That makes me think about complementary angles and the sine function's property that sin(180° - x) = sin x. So, sin 100° is sin(80°), sin 120° is sin(60°), sin 140° is sin(40°), and sin 160° is sin(20°). Wait, so actually, the terms from 100° to 160° are just the same as the earlier terms from 20° to 80°, but in reverse order. So, the product is actually [sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°]^2. That simplifies things a bit because now I just need to compute the square of the product of four sines.

So, let me write that down: the original product is [sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°]^2. Now, I can focus on computing sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° first and then square the result.

I remember that there's a formula for the product of sines in an arithmetic progression. Specifically, for angles that are equally spaced, like 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, which are spaced by 20°, the product can be expressed using a known identity. Let me recall that identity.

I think the formula is something like sin θ sin(θ + α) sin(θ + 2α)... up to n terms. But I'm not sure about the exact form. Maybe I should look for a specific identity for the product of four sines with angles in arithmetic progression.

Wait, another approach: I remember that sin θ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) = (sin 3θ)/4. Maybe I can use this identity here. Let me see if that applies.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°. Hmm, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°. If I take θ = 20°, then 60° - θ = 40°, and 60° + θ = 80°. So, sin 20° sin 40° sin 80° = sin 3*20° / 4 = sin 60° / 4. Since sin 60° is √3/2, this product becomes (√3/2)/4 = √3/8.

So, sin 20° sin 40° sin 80° = √3/8. Then, the original product is [sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°]^2 = [ (√3/8) * sin 60° ]^2. Wait, hold on, I think I missed the sin 60° term in the previous step.

Let me correct that. The product sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° can be grouped as (sin 20° sin 40° sin 80°) * sin 60°. From the identity, sin 20° sin 40° sin 80° = √3/8, so multiplying by sin 60° which is √3/2, we get (√3/8) * (√3/2) = (3/16).

Therefore, the product sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° is 3/16. Then, the original problem is the square of this, so (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when I grouped sin 20° sin 40° sin 80°, I used the identity sin θ sin(60° - θ) sin(60° + θ) = sin 3θ / 4. So, θ = 20°, so sin 20° sin 40° sin 80° = sin 60° / 4 = (√3/2)/4 = √3/8. Then, multiplying by sin 60°, which is √3/2, gives (√3/8)(√3/2) = (3)/(16). So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the product sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° sin 100° sin 120° sin 140° sin 160° is equal to [3/16]^2 = 9/256.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the grouping. The original product is sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° sin 100° sin 120° sin 140° sin 160°. As I noticed earlier, sin 100° = sin(80°), sin 120° = sin(60°), sin 140° = sin(40°), sin 160° = sin(20°). So, the product is [sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°]^2. So, that's correct.

So, sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° is 3/16, so squared is 9/256. Therefore, the value is 9/256.

But just to be thorough, let me compute this numerically to check.

Compute each sine:

sin 20° ≈ 0.3420
sin 40° ≈ 0.6428
sin 60° ≈ 0.8660
sin 80° ≈ 0.9848
sin 100° ≈ 0.9848
sin 120° ≈ 0.8660
sin 140° ≈ 0.6428
sin 160° ≈ 0.3420

Multiply them all together:

First, multiply sin20 * sin40 ≈ 0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2198

Then, sin60 * sin80 ≈ 0.8660 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.8525

Then, sin100 * sin120 ≈ 0.9848 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.8525

Then, sin140 * sin160 ≈ 0.6428 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.2198

Now, multiply these four results together: 0.2198 * 0.8525 ≈ 0.1875; then 0.1875 * 0.8525 ≈ 0.1600; then 0.1600 * 0.2198 ≈ 0.035168.

Now, 9/256 is approximately 0.03515625. That's very close to the numerical value I just got, 0.035168. So, that seems to confirm that 9/256 is the correct answer.

Therefore, I can be confident that the value of the product is 9/256.

**Final Answer**
The value of the product is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}.
</think>

To find the value of the product $\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ$, we can use the property of complementary angles and known trigonometric identities.

First, we note that $\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x$. Therefore, the terms $\sin 100^\circ$, $\sin 120^\circ$, $\sin 140^\circ$, and $\sin 160^\circ$ can be rewritten as $\sin 80^\circ$, $\sin 60^\circ$, $\sin 40^\circ$, and $\sin 20^\circ$ respectively. This means the product can be simplified to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines in arithmetic progression. For $\theta = 20^\circ$, we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4}
\]

Since $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Now, we include $\sin 60^\circ$ in the product:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{3}{16}
\]

Thus, the original product is the square of this result:

\[
\left(\frac{3}{16}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{256}
\]

Therefore, the value of the product is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}

"Alright, so I have this question here about cylindrical coordinates and what the equation \( z = c \) represents. Hmm, okay, let me think. I remember that cylindrical coordinates are kind of like polar coordinates but with an added z-component for height. So, in cylindrical coordinates, we have \( r \), \( \theta \), and \( z \). 

The equation given is \( z = c \). So, what does this mean? Well, in Cartesian coordinates, \( z = c \) would represent a plane parallel to the xy-plane, right? But since we're in cylindrical coordinates, I need to translate that understanding.

In cylindrical coordinates, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angle around the z-axis, and \( z \) is the height. So, if \( z \) is fixed at \( c \), that means for any point, no matter how far out it is in the radial direction (\( r \)) or how it's angled around the z-axis (\( \theta \)), its height \( z \) remains constant at \( c \).

So, what geometric shape does that describe? Well, in three dimensions, if you fix one coordinate (in this case, \( z \)) and let the others vary, you get a plane. But wait, in cylindrical coordinates, a plane where \( z \) is constant would actually be a horizontal plane, right? It's parallel to the r-theta plane, which is like the xy-plane in Cartesian.

But hold on, the options given are: (A) ਰੇਖਾ, (B) ਵਰਤਾਅ, (C) ਪਲੇਨ, (D) ਗੋਲਕ, (E) ਸਿਲਿੰਡਰ, (F) ਕੋਨ. So, translating the options, they are: (A) line, (B) cone, (C) plane, (D) sphere, (E) cylinder, (F) cone.

So, if \( z = c \) is a plane, then the answer should be (C) ਪਲੇਨ. But wait, let me make sure. In cylindrical coordinates, is \( z = c \) a plane or something else? Because sometimes in cylindrical coordinates, certain equations can represent different shapes.

Wait, in cylindrical coordinates, the equation \( z = c \) doesn't involve \( r \) or \( \theta \), so it's independent of those. That means for any \( r \) and \( \theta \), \( z \) is fixed. So, yes, that's a plane. It's a horizontal plane cutting through the z-axis at height \( c \).

But just to double-check, sometimes in cylindrical coordinates, equations can represent cylinders when they involve \( r \) but not \( z \). For example, \( r = c \) is a cylinder. But here, it's \( z = c \), so it's not a cylinder but a plane. So, yeah, (C) ਪਲੇਨ is the correct answer.

I think I'm confident with that. So, the answer is (C).
</think>

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates represents a plane where the height \( z \) is fixed at \( c \), while \( r \) and \( \theta \) can vary. This corresponds to a horizontal plane.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible angle between two vectors a and b. The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 2, the magnitude of vector b is 7, and their cross product is the vector (3, 2, 6). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is related to the sine of the angle between them. The formula is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can then solve for sinθ and then find the angle θ.

Let me calculate the magnitude of the cross product vector. The cross product is given as (3, 2, 6). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Let me compute that: 3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those up: 9 + 4 is 13, plus 36 is 49. So the magnitude is sqrt(49), which is 7. Okay, so ||a × b|| is 7.

Now, plugging into the formula: 7 = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. We know ||a|| is 2 and ||b|| is 7, so substituting those in: 7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ. Let me compute 2 * 7, that's 14. So, 7 = 14 sinθ. To solve for sinθ, I divide both sides by 14: sinθ = 7 / 14, which simplifies to sinθ = 0.5.

Now, I need to find the angle θ whose sine is 0.5. I remember that sin(30°) is 0.5, so θ is 30 degrees. Since the problem asks for the smallest possible angle, and sine is positive in both the first and second quadrants, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I calculated the magnitude of the cross product correctly: sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²) = sqrt(9 + 4 + 36) = sqrt(49) = 7. Then, using the formula, 7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ, which simplifies to sinθ = 0.5. That gives θ = 30 degrees. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the smallest possible angle between vectors a and b is 30 degrees.
</think>

The smallest possible angle between vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is found using the magnitude of their cross product. Given $\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2$, $\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7$, and $\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}$, we calculate:

1. The magnitude of the cross product:
   \[
   \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{49} = 7
   \]

2. Using the formula $\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin\theta$:
   \[
   7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin\theta \implies \sin\theta = \frac{7}{14} = 0.5
   \]

3. Solving for $\theta$:
   \[
   \theta = \arcsin(0.5) = 30^\circ
   \]

The smallest possible angle is $\boxed{30}$ degrees.","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the roots of the function g(x), which is defined as f(x + 5). The function f(x) is given as f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for any cubic polynomial of the form ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of its roots is given by -b/a. So, if I can find the coefficients of the cubic polynomial that defines g(x), I can use this formula to find the sum of its roots.

But wait, g(x) is defined as f(x + 5). That means g(x) is a transformation of f(x). Specifically, it's a horizontal shift. Shifting a function horizontally doesn't change the shape of the graph, just its position. So, the roots of g(x) are the roots of f(x) shifted 5 units to the left. In other words, if r is a root of f(x), then r - 5 is a root of g(x).

But hold on, I don't actually know the roots of f(x). Maybe I don't need them. Since g(x) is just f(x + 5), perhaps I can express g(x) in terms of f(x + 5) and then expand it to find the coefficients.

Let me try that. So, g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Okay, now I need to expand each of these terms. Let's do this step by step.

First, expand (x + 5)³. I remember that (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So, applying that here:

(x + 5)³ = x³ + 3*(x²)*5 + 3*x*(5)² + 5³
= x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

Next, expand -49(x + 5)². First, expand (x + 5)², which is x² + 10x + 25. Then multiply by -49:

-49(x² + 10x + 25) = -49x² - 490x - 1225.

Then, expand 623(x + 5). That's straightforward:

623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115.

And the last term is just -2015.

Now, let's put all these expanded terms together:

g(x) = (x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125) + (-49x² - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015.

Now, let's combine like terms. Let's start with the x³ term:

x³.

Next, the x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = (15 - 49)x² = -34x².

Then, the x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that:

75 - 490 + 623 = (75 + 623) - 490 = 698 - 490 = 208. So, 208x.

Now, the constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015.

Let's compute that step by step:

125 - 1225 = -1100.

-1100 + 3115 = 2015.

2015 - 2015 = 0.

So, the constant term is 0.

Putting it all together, g(x) simplifies to:

g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x.

Wait, so g(x) is a cubic polynomial with coefficients 1 for x³, -34 for x², 208 for x, and 0 for the constant term.

Now, since g(x) is a cubic polynomial, it has three roots (real or complex). The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial ax³ + bx² + cx + d is given by -b/a. In this case, a is 1 and b is -34. So, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in expanding or combining terms.

Let me go back through the expansion:

1. (x + 5)³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125. That looks correct.

2. -49(x + 5)² = -49(x² + 10x + 25) = -49x² - 490x - 1225. Correct.

3. 623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115. Correct.

4. Then, combining all terms:

x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125 -49x² -490x -1225 +623x +3115 -2015.

Combining x³: x³.

x²: 15x² -49x² = -34x².

x terms: 75x -490x +623x. 75 -490 is -415, plus 623 is 208. So, 208x.

Constants: 125 -1225 is -1100, plus 3115 is 2015, minus 2015 is 0. Correct.

So, g(x) = x³ -34x² +208x. So, the coefficients are correct.

Therefore, the sum of the roots is -b/a = -(-34)/1 = 34.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is that since g(x) = f(x + 5), the roots of g(x) are the roots of f(x) shifted left by 5. So, if the roots of f(x) are r1, r2, r3, then the roots of g(x) are r1 -5, r2 -5, r3 -5.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) is (r1 -5) + (r2 -5) + (r3 -5) = (r1 + r2 + r3) -15.

But from f(x), the sum of its roots is -b/a, which is -(-49)/1 = 49. So, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 49 -15 = 34. That's another way to get the same answer, which confirms that 34 is correct.

So, whether I expand g(x) and use the formula for the sum of roots or use the transformation of roots, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that 34 is the correct answer.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.
</think>

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is found by expanding \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \) and using the formula for the sum of roots of a cubic polynomial. After expanding and simplifying, the polynomial \( g(x) \) is \( x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \). The sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} = 34 \).

"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to calculate the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}\) is equal to \(\sec^2 \theta\), and similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\) is \(\csc^2 \theta\). So, maybe I can rewrite the expression in terms of secant and cosecant. Let me write that down:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Now, I recall that there's an identity for \(\sec^2 \theta\), which is \(1 + \tan^2 \theta\). So, maybe I can express each term using tangent and cotangent. Let me try that:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Wait, hold on. Is that right? Because \(\csc^2 \theta\) is actually \(1 + \cot^2 \theta\), not \(\tan^2\). So, correcting that, the expression becomes:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Simplifying that, I get:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, okay. So now I have 3 plus some squared terms. I wonder if I can find a relationship between these angles. Let me note that 10°, 20°, and 40° are all multiples of 10°, and 20° is double 10°, and 40° is double 20°. Maybe there's a trigonometric identity that relates these.

I remember that \(\cot 2\theta = \frac{\cot^2 \theta - 1}{2 \cot \theta}\). Maybe I can use that to express \(\cot 20^\circ\) in terms of \(\cot 10^\circ\) or something like that. Let me try that.

Let’s set \(\theta = 10^\circ\), so \(2\theta = 20^\circ\). Then,

\[
\cot 20^\circ = \frac{\cot^2 10^\circ - 1}{2 \cot 10^\circ}
\]

Let me denote \(x = \cot 10^\circ\) for simplicity. Then,

\[
\cot 20^\circ = \frac{x^2 - 1}{2x}
\]

Similarly, if I let \(\theta = 20^\circ\), then \(2\theta = 40^\circ\), so:

\[
\cot 40^\circ = \frac{\cot^2 20^\circ - 1}{2 \cot 20^\circ}
\]

But since I already expressed \(\cot 20^\circ\) in terms of \(x\), maybe I can substitute that in. Let me compute \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(x\).

First, let me compute \(\cot^2 20^\circ\):

\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \left( \frac{x^2 - 1}{2x} \right)^2 = \frac{(x^2 - 1)^2}{4x^2}
\]

So, plugging that into the expression for \(\cot 40^\circ\):

\[
\cot 40^\circ = \frac{\frac{(x^2 - 1)^2}{4x^2} - 1}{2 \cdot \frac{x^2 - 1}{2x}} = \frac{\frac{(x^2 - 1)^2 - 4x^2}{4x^2}}{\frac{2(x^2 - 1)}{2x}} = \frac{(x^2 - 1)^2 - 4x^2}{4x^2} \cdot \frac{2x}{2(x^2 - 1)}
\]

Simplifying numerator and denominator:

First, the numerator of the first fraction: \((x^2 - 1)^2 - 4x^2\)

Expanding \((x^2 - 1)^2\):

\[
x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 - 4x^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 1
\]

So, the numerator becomes \(x^4 - 6x^2 + 1\).

The denominator of the first fraction is \(4x^2\), and the denominator of the second fraction is \(2(x^2 - 1)\). So, putting it all together:

\[
\cot 40^\circ = \frac{x^4 - 6x^2 + 1}{4x^2} \cdot \frac{2x}{2(x^2 - 1)} = \frac{(x^4 - 6x^2 + 1) \cdot 2x}{4x^2 \cdot 2(x^2 - 1)}
\]

Wait, let me check that again. The first fraction is \(\frac{x^4 - 6x^2 + 1}{4x^2}\), and the second fraction is \(\frac{2x}{2(x^2 - 1)}\). So, multiplying them:

\[
\frac{(x^4 - 6x^2 + 1)}{4x^2} \times \frac{2x}{2(x^2 - 1)} = \frac{(x^4 - 6x^2 + 1) \times 2x}{4x^2 \times 2(x^2 - 1)} = \frac{(x^4 - 6x^2 + 1) \times x}{4x^2 \times (x^2 - 1)}
\]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(x(x^4 - 6x^2 + 1)\)

Denominator: \(4x^2(x^2 - 1)\)

Cancel out an x:

\[
\frac{x^4 - 6x^2 + 1}{4x(x^2 - 1)}
\]

So, \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{x^4 - 6x^2 + 1}{4x(x^2 - 1)}\)

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\tan 3\theta\). I remember that \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\). Maybe that can help since 30° is a multiple of 10°, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 10°, 20°, 40°, 80°, etc., are all related through doubling angles. Maybe I can use some product-to-sum identities or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of sine and cosine and see if something cancels out.

Let me write the original expression again:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}
\]

Which is:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

I know that \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\) and \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\), so maybe I can express everything in terms of tangents and cotangents.

So, substituting:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

So, now I have 3 plus these squared terms. Maybe I can find a relationship between these terms.

I recall that \(\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)\), so \(\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ\). So, maybe I can rewrite the expression as:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

Hmm, that might be helpful because 10°, 50°, and 70° are all related through complementary angles. Maybe there's a known identity for the sum of squares of tangents at these angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\tan A \tan B\) when A + B = 90°, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: I remember that in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180°, but I don't know if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\tan 3\theta\). Let me try that.

For \(\theta = 10^\circ\), \(3\theta = 30^\circ\), so:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}
\]

I know that \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\), so:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}
\]

Let me denote \(t = \tan 10^\circ\) for simplicity. Then:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3t^2) = 3(3t - t^3)
\]

Simplify both sides:

Left side: \(\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3} t^2\)

Right side: \(9t - 3t^3\)

Bring all terms to one side:

\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3} t^2 - 9t + 3t^3 = 0
\]

Rearranged:

\[
3t^3 - 3\sqrt{3} t^2 - 9t + \sqrt{3} = 0
\]

Hmm, this is a cubic equation in t. Maybe I can factor it or find a relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\tan^2 50^\circ\), and \(\tan^2 70^\circ\) in terms of each other or something.

Wait, another idea: I remember that \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ\) and \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\). So, \(\tan^2 50^\circ = \cot^2 40^\circ\) and \(\tan^2 70^\circ = \cot^2 20^\circ\). So, in the expression \(3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ\), it's equivalent to \(3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\), which is the same as the original expression. So, that doesn't help much.

Wait, maybe I can use the identity for \(\tan A + \tan B + \tan C\) when A + B + C = 180°, but in this case, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which is not 180°, so that might not apply.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for the sum of squares of tangents. I recall that for angles in arithmetic progression, there might be some identities, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can use the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\). Since 3*10°=30°, 3*20°=60°, 3*40°=120°, but I don't see a direct connection.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\). Let me try that for \(\theta = 10^\circ\):

\[
\sin 30^\circ = 3\sin 10^\circ - 4\sin^3 10^\circ
\]

We know that \(\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = 3\sin 10^\circ - 4\sin^3 10^\circ
\]

Let me denote \(s = \sin 10^\circ\). Then:

\[
4s^3 - 3s + \frac{1}{2} = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
8s^3 - 6s + 1 = 0
\]

So, we have a cubic equation in s: \(8s^3 - 6s + 1 = 0\). Maybe I can find a relationship here.

Similarly, for \(\theta = 20^\circ\):

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find a number t such that 0 < t < 23, and t + 2 is the modular inverse of t modulo 23. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the modular inverse of a number t modulo 23 is another number, let's call it t^{-1}, such that when you multiply t by t^{-1}, you get 1 modulo 23. So, in this case, the problem says that t + 2 is the inverse of t. That means t * (t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23.

So, I can write the equation as t(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. Let me expand that: t² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23. Then, subtracting 1 from both sides gives me t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. This is a quadratic congruence equation.

I think the next step is to solve this quadratic equation modulo 23. To solve t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23, I can use the quadratic formula for modular arithmetic. The quadratic formula in modular arithmetic is similar to the standard one, but we have to be careful with division and square roots modulo a prime number, which 23 is.

The standard quadratic formula is t = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -1. Plugging these into the formula, we get t = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 4)] / 2. That simplifies to t = [-2 ± sqrt(8)] / 2.

Now, sqrt(8) modulo 23. Hmm, I need to find a number x such that x² ≡ 8 mod 23. Let me try squaring numbers from 1 to 22 to see which ones give 8 modulo 23.

1² = 1
2² = 4
3² = 9
4² = 16
5² = 25 ≡ 2
6² = 36 ≡ 13
7² = 49 ≡ 3
8² = 64 ≡ 18
9² = 81 ≡ 12
10² = 100 ≡ 8

Oh, wait, 10² is 100, and 100 divided by 23 is 4 with a remainder of 8. So, 10² ≡ 8 mod 23. That means sqrt(8) ≡ 10 mod 23. But also, since -10 mod 23 is 13 (because 23 - 10 = 13), sqrt(8) can also be 13 mod 23.

So, going back to the formula, t = [-2 ± 10] / 2 mod 23 and t = [-2 ± 13] / 2 mod 23.

Let's compute both possibilities.

First, t = (-2 + 10)/2 = 8/2 = 4 mod 23. Then, t = (-2 - 10)/2 = (-12)/2 = -6 mod 23. Since -6 mod 23 is 17 (because 23 - 6 = 17), so t = 17.

Second, t = (-2 + 13)/2 = 11/2 mod 23. Hmm, dividing by 2 modulo 23. Since 2 * 12 = 24 ≡ 1 mod 23, so 2^{-1} ≡ 12 mod 23. Therefore, 11/2 ≡ 11 * 12 mod 23. 11*12 = 132. 132 divided by 23 is 5 with a remainder of 17, so 132 ≡ 17 mod 23. So, t = 17.

Wait, that's the same as before. So, both possibilities give t = 4 and t = 17.

Let me check if these satisfy the original condition. For t = 4: t + 2 = 6. Is 6 the inverse of 4 mod 23? Let's check 4*6 = 24 ≡ 1 mod 23. Yes, that works.

For t = 17: t + 2 = 19. Is 19 the inverse of 17 mod 23? Let's check 17*19. 17*20 = 340, subtract 17 gives 323. Now, 323 divided by 23: 23*14 = 322, so 323 ≡ 1 mod 23. Yes, that also works.

So, both t = 4 and t = 17 satisfy the condition. But wait, the problem says ""the"" number t, implying there might be only one. But in modular arithmetic, quadratic equations can have two solutions. So, both 4 and 17 are valid.

But let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23.

Using quadratic formula: t = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 4)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(8)] / 2.

sqrt(8) is 10 and 13, as 10²=100≡8 and 13²=169≡169-7*23=169-161=8.

So, t = (-2 +10)/2=8/2=4, and t=(-2-10)/2=-12/2=-6≡17 mod23.

Similarly, t=(-2+13)/2=11/2=11*12=132≡17 mod23, and t=(-2-13)/2=-15/2=-15*12= -180≡-180+8*23=-180+184=4 mod23.

So, yes, both solutions are 4 and 17.

But the problem says ""the"" number t, so maybe it's expecting both? Or perhaps I misread. Let me check the problem again.

It says, ""Find the number t such that 0 < t < 23 and t + 2 is the modular inverse of t modulo 23.""

So, it's asking for the number t, but there are two such numbers. So, maybe both 4 and 17 are correct.

But in the initial problem statement, it's written as ""the number t"", which is singular, but maybe in the context, it's expecting both. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic formula.

Wait, let me verify t=4: 4*6=24≡1 mod23, correct.

t=17:17*19=323≡1 mod23, correct.

So, both are valid. Therefore, the solutions are t=4 and t=17.

But the problem says ""the number t"", so maybe it's expecting both. Alternatively, perhaps I should present both as solutions.

So, the final answer is t=4 and t=17.

But let me check if there are any other solutions. Since it's a quadratic equation modulo a prime, there can be at most two solutions, which we have found. So, these are the only solutions.

Therefore, the numbers t are 4 and 17.
</think>

The solutions are t = 4 and t = 17. Both satisfy the condition that t + 2 is the modular inverse of t modulo 23.

Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the total surface area of a cube in square inches, given that its volume is 1 cubic foot. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that a cube has all sides equal, so if I can find the length of one side, I can figure out the surface area. The volume of a cube is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{side}^3 \]

Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, I can set up the equation:

\[ 1 \, \text{ft}^3 = \text{side}^3 \]

To find the side length, I take the cube root of both sides:

\[ \text{side} = \sqrt[3]{1 \, \text{ft}^3} = 1 \, \text{ft} \]

So each side of the cube is 1 foot long. But the question asks for the surface area in square inches. I need to convert the side length from feet to inches because 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore:

\[ 1 \, \text{ft} = 12 \, \text{inches} \]

Now, the surface area of a cube is calculated by the formula:

\[ \text{Surface Area} = 6 \times (\text{side})^2 \]

Plugging in the side length in inches:

\[ \text{Surface Area} = 6 \times (12 \, \text{inches})^2 \]

Calculating the square of 12 inches:

\[ (12)^2 = 144 \, \text{square inches} \]

Then multiply by 6:

\[ 6 \times 144 = 864 \, \text{square inches} \]

So, the total surface area of the cube is 864 square inches.

First, I should figure out what f(5) is. Since f(x) is 2x - 3, plugging in 5 for x should give me f(5). Let me calculate that: 2 times 5 is 10, and then subtracting 3 gives me 7. So, f(5) equals 7. That seems straightforward.

Now, the expression inside the g function is f(5) minus 1. I've just found that f(5) is 7, so subtracting 1 from that gives me 6. So, now I need to find g(6). 

Looking at the function g(x), which is x + 1, plugging in 6 for x should be simple. Adding 1 to 6 gives me 7. So, g(6) equals 7. 

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with f(5): 2*5 is 10, minus 3 is indeed 7. Then, 7 minus 1 is 6. Plugging 6 into g(x): 6 + 1 is 7. Yep, that seems correct.

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: sin(tan⁻¹(x) + cot⁻¹(1/x)) = 1/3. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that tan⁻¹(x) is the inverse tangent function, which gives me an angle whose tangent is x. Similarly, cot⁻¹(1/x) is the inverse cotangent of 1/x, which should give me another angle. So, the equation is asking for the sine of the sum of these two angles, and that sine equals 1/3.

I remember that there's a formula for the sine of a sum of two angles: sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. Maybe I can use that here. Let me denote A as tan⁻¹(x) and B as cot⁻¹(1/x). So, sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB.

Now, I need to find expressions for sinA, cosA, sinB, and cosB in terms of x. Let's start with A = tan⁻¹(x). If A is tan⁻¹(x), then tanA = x. I can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is x and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse would be sqrt(x² + 1). Therefore, sinA = opposite/hypotenuse = x / sqrt(x² + 1), and cosA = adjacent/hypotenuse = 1 / sqrt(x² + 1).

Okay, that takes care of A. Now, let's look at B = cot⁻¹(1/x). Similarly, cotB = 1/x, which means tanB = x. Wait, that's interesting. So, if tanB = x, then B is also tan⁻¹(x). Hmm, is that correct? Let me think. Actually, cot⁻¹(1/x) is equal to tan⁻¹(x) because cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so their inverse functions are related. So, yes, B = tan⁻¹(x). That means both A and B are equal to tan⁻¹(x). So, A = B = tan⁻¹(x).

Wait, that can't be right because if A and B are both tan⁻¹(x), then A + B would be 2 tan⁻¹(x). But let me verify that. If B = cot⁻¹(1/x), then since cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ), so cot⁻¹(1/x) = tan⁻¹(x). So, yes, B is indeed tan⁻¹(x). So, A + B = 2 tan⁻¹(x). Therefore, the equation becomes sin(2 tan⁻¹(x)) = 1/3.

Hmm, that seems simpler. Now, I can use the double-angle formula for sine: sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. Let me set θ = tan⁻¹(x). So, sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. From earlier, I have sinθ = x / sqrt(x² + 1) and cosθ = 1 / sqrt(x² + 1). So, plugging these into the double-angle formula, sin(2θ) = 2*(x / sqrt(x² + 1))*(1 / sqrt(x² + 1)) = 2x / (x² + 1).

So, the equation becomes 2x / (x² + 1) = 1/3. Now, I can solve for x. Let's write that equation:

2x / (x² + 1) = 1/3

Multiply both sides by (x² + 1):

2x = (x² + 1)/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:

6x = x² + 1

Bring all terms to one side:

x² - 6x + 1 = 0

Now, I have a quadratic equation: x² - 6x + 1 = 0. I can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 4*1*1)] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(32)] / 2.

Simplify sqrt(32): sqrt(32) = sqrt(16*2) = 4*sqrt(2). So, x = [6 ± 4√2] / 2. Simplify numerator:

x = (6 + 4√2)/2 or x = (6 - 4√2)/2

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:

x = 3 + 2√2 or x = 3 - 2√2

So, the solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2.

Wait, but I should check if these solutions are valid because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, there might be domain restrictions or extraneous solutions.

Let me check x = 3 + 2√2 first. Since 3 + 2√2 is approximately 3 + 2.828 = 5.828, which is positive. Similarly, 3 - 2√2 is approximately 3 - 2.828 = 0.172, which is also positive. Since both x values are positive, and tan⁻¹(x) is defined for all real numbers, so both solutions should be valid.

But just to be thorough, let me plug them back into the original equation to verify.

First, let's take x = 3 + 2√2.

Compute tan⁻¹(x) + cot⁻¹(1/x). Since we already established that cot⁻¹(1/x) = tan⁻¹(x), so this becomes tan⁻¹(x) + tan⁻¹(x) = 2 tan⁻¹(x). So, sin(2 tan⁻¹(x)) should be 1/3.

From earlier, sin(2 tan⁻¹(x)) = 2x / (x² + 1). Let's compute that:

2x / (x² + 1) = 2*(3 + 2√2) / [(3 + 2√2)² + 1]

First, compute (3 + 2√2)²:

= 9 + 12√2 + 8 = 17 + 12√2

So, denominator is 17 + 12√2 + 1 = 18 + 12√2

Numerator is 2*(3 + 2√2) = 6 + 4√2

So, 2x / (x² + 1) = (6 + 4√2) / (18 + 12√2)

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2*(3 + 2√2)

Denominator: 6*(3 + 2√2)

So, (2*(3 + 2√2)) / (6*(3 + 2√2)) = 2/6 = 1/3

Which matches the given equation. So, x = 3 + 2√2 is a valid solution.

Now, let's check x = 3 - 2√2.

Similarly, sin(2 tan⁻¹(x)) = 2x / (x² + 1). Let's compute this:

2x = 2*(3 - 2√2) = 6 - 4√2

x² = (3 - 2√2)² = 9 - 12√2 + 8 = 17 - 12√2

So, x² + 1 = 17 - 12√2 + 1 = 18 - 12√2

Therefore, 2x / (x² + 1) = (6 - 4√2) / (18 - 12√2)

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2*(3 - 2√2)

Denominator: 6*(3 - 2√2)

So, (2*(3 - 2√2)) / (6*(3 - 2√2)) = 2/6 = 1/3

Again, it matches the given equation. So, x = 3 - 2√2 is also a valid solution.

Therefore, both solutions are correct.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the range of tan⁻¹(x). It's between -π/2 and π/2, so when we take tan⁻¹(x) + cot⁻¹(1/x), which is 2 tan⁻¹(x), the result is between -π and π. But since x is positive in both cases, 2 tan⁻¹(x) will be between 0 and π, so sine is positive, which matches the given equation sin(...) = 1/3, which is positive. So, both solutions are valid.

I think that's thorough enough. So, the solutions are x = 3 + 2√2 and x = 3 - 2√2.

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} and \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}.
</think>

Given the equation:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We start by recognizing that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) is equivalent to \(\tan^{-1} (x)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Using the double-angle formula for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\), we let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). This gives us:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1} (x)) = 2 \sin(\tan^{-1} (x)) \cos(\tan^{-1} (x))
\]

For \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle formula, we get:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Solving for \(x\), we multiply both sides by \(x^2 + 1\):

\[
2x = \frac{x^2 + 1}{3}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 3:

\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]

Rearranging into a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) with \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Both solutions \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are valid as they satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer
The solutions are \boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}} and \boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}.","[{2*sqrt(2) + 3, -1*2*sqrt(2) + 3}, '3 + 2\\sqrt{2},3 - 2\\sqrt{2}']",3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2},"[2, '2']",False
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. Both lines are given in vector form, which I remember is like a point plus a direction vector multiplied by a parameter. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.

The first line is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
And the second line is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Hmm, okay. The problem says they are parallel, so their direction vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. Let me check that real quick. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the second one is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). If I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), which is exactly the second direction vector. So yes, they are parallel. Good.

Now, to find the distance between two parallel lines, I remember there's a formula involving the cross product. Let me recall the formula. I think it's something like the magnitude of the cross product of the direction vectors divided by the magnitude of the direction vector, but wait, no, that's for something else. Maybe it's the distance from a point on one line to the other line.

Yes, right. The distance between two parallel lines is the distance from any point on one line to the other line. So, I can pick a point on the first line, say when \(t = 0\), which is \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), and then find the distance from this point to the second line.

To find the distance from a point to a line in 3D, the formula is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{||\vec{v} \times \vec{w}||}{||\vec{v}||}
\]
where \(\vec{v}\) is the direction vector of the line, and \(\vec{w}\) is the vector from a point on the line to the external point.

Wait, let me make sure. So, if I have a line \(\vec{r} = \vec{a} + t\vec{v}\) and a point \(\vec{b}\), then the distance from \(\vec{b}\) to the line is the length of the cross product of \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{b} - \vec{a}\) divided by the length of \(\vec{v}\). Yeah, that sounds right.

So, in this case, \(\vec{a}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) for the second line, and \(\vec{b}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, \(\vec{b} - \vec{a}\) is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 - (-5) \\ -10 - (-3) \\ 1 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Okay, so \(\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\), and the direction vector \(\vec{v}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Now, I need to compute the cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{w}\). Let me recall how to do that. The cross product of two vectors \(\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ w_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:
\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 \\ v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 \\ v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So plugging in the values:
- First component: \( (-18)(-5) - (-4)(-7) = 90 - 28 = 62 \)
- Second component: \( (-4)(8) - (4)(-5) = -32 + 20 = -12 \)
- Third component: \( (4)(-7) - (-18)(8) = -28 + 144 = 116 \)

So, the cross product is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 62 \\ -12 \\ 116 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is calculated as:
\[
||\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|| = \sqrt{62^2 + (-12)^2 + 116^2}
\]
Calculating each term:
- \(62^2 = 3844\)
- \((-12)^2 = 144\)
- \(116^2 = 13456\)

Adding them up: \(3844 + 144 = 4000\), then \(4000 + 13456 = 17456\). So, the magnitude is \(\sqrt{17456}\).

Let me compute \(\sqrt{17456}\). Hmm, 132 squared is 17,424 because 130^2=16,900 and 132^2=17,424. Then 133^2=17,689. So, 17,456 is between 132^2 and 133^2. Let me see, 132^2=17,424, so 17,456 - 17,424=32. So, it's 132 + 32/(2*132) approximately, but maybe it's a whole number. Wait, 132^2=17,424, 132.5^2= (132 + 0.5)^2=132^2 + 2*132*0.5 + 0.25=17,424 + 132 + 0.25=17,556.25, which is higher than 17,456. So, maybe it's not a whole number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the cross product. Maybe I miscalculated one of the components.

First component: \(v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 = (-18)(-5) - (-4)(-7) = 90 - 28 = 62. That seems right.

Second component: \(v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 = (-4)(8) - (4)(-5) = -32 + 20 = -12. That also seems correct.

Third component: \(v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 = (4)(-7) - (-18)(8) = -28 + 144 = 116. That's correct too.

So, the cross product is indeed \(\begin{pmatrix}62 \\ -12 \\ 116\end{pmatrix}\). So, the magnitude is \(\sqrt{62^2 + (-12)^2 + 116^2}\).

Wait, 62 squared is 3,844, 12 squared is 144, 116 squared is 13,456. Adding them: 3,844 + 144 = 4,000; 4,000 + 13,456 = 17,456. So, sqrt(17,456). Let me see if 17,456 is a perfect square.

Let me try 132: 132*132=17,424. 133*133=17,689. So, 17,456 is between them. Let me see, 132.5^2=17,556.25, which is higher. So, maybe it's not a whole number. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 17,456 to see if it's a multiple of a square.

17,456 divided by 16 is 1,091. So, 17,456=16*1,091. Hmm, 1,091 is a prime number? Let me check. 1,091 divided by 13 is 83.92, not integer. 1,091 divided by 7 is 155.85, not integer. Maybe it's prime. So, sqrt(17,456)=4*sqrt(1,091). Hmm, that's not a nice number. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should compute the cross product again, just to be sure.

Wait, the cross product formula is:

\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 \\ v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 \\ v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, plugging in:

First component: \(v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 = (-18)(-5) - (-4)(-7) = 90 - 28 = 62. Correct.

Second component: \(v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 = (-4)(8) - (4)(-5) = -32 + 20 = -12. Correct.

Third component: \(v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 = (4)(-7) - (-18)(8) = -28 + 144 = 116. Correct.

So, cross product is correct. So, the magnitude is sqrt(62^2 + (-12)^2 + 116^2) = sqrt(3,844 + 144 + 13,456) = sqrt(17,444). Wait, wait, 62^2 is 3,844, 12^2 is 144, 116^2 is 13,456. So, 3,844 + 144 is 4,000, plus 13,456 is 17,456. So, sqrt(17,456). Hmm, maybe I can factor this differently.

Wait, 17,456 divided by 4 is 4,364. 4,364 divided by 4 is 1,091. So, 17,456 = 4*4*1,091 = 16*1,091. So, sqrt(17,456) = 4*sqrt(1,091). Hmm, 1,091 is a prime number, I think. So, that's as simplified as it gets.

Now, the denominator is the magnitude of the direction vector, which is ||v||. The direction vector is \(\begin{pmatrix}4 \\ -18 \\ -4\end{pmatrix}\). So, its magnitude is sqrt(4^2 + (-18)^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(16 + 324 + 16) = sqrt(356). Let me compute sqrt(356). 18^2=324, 19^2=361, so sqrt(356) is between 18 and 19. 18.8^2=353.44, 18.9^2=357.21. So, sqrt(356) is approximately 18.87.

But maybe I can factor 356. 356 divided by 4 is 89, which is a prime number. So, sqrt(356)=2*sqrt(89). So, the denominator is 2*sqrt(89).

So, putting it all together, the distance is sqrt(17,456)/sqrt(356). Let me compute that.

Wait, sqrt(17,456)/sqrt(356) = sqrt(17,456/356). Let me compute 17,456 divided by 356.

356*49=356*50=17,800 minus 356=17,800-356=17,444. So, 356*49=17,444. Then, 17,456 - 17,444=12. So, 17,456=356*49 +12. So, 17,456/356=49 + 12/356=49 + 3/89≈49.0337.

So, sqrt(49.0337)=7.0024. So, approximately 7 units. Hmm, that's a nice number. Maybe it's exactly 7. Let me check.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of integer coordinate points inside a rectangle defined by the points (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), and (5,-4). Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this first.

First, I should probably sketch the rectangle on a coordinate plane to get a better idea. The points given are the four corners, so plotting them out: (5,4) is in the first quadrant, (-5,4) is in the second, (-5,-4) is in the third, and (5,-4) is in the fourth. Connecting these points should form a rectangle centered at the origin.

Now, the rectangle's sides are parallel to the axes, which makes things a bit easier. The length along the x-axis goes from -5 to 5, so that's a total width of 10 units. Similarly, the height along the y-axis goes from -4 to 4, which is 8 units tall. But wait, the problem is about the points inside the rectangle, not including the boundary, right? Or is it including? Hmm, the question says ""ਅੰਦਰ ਕਿੰਨੇ ਬਿੰਦੂ"", which translates to ""how many points inside the rectangle"". So I think it's excluding the boundary.

But let me double-check. If it's including the boundary, the count would be different. Since the problem says ""ਵਜੋਂ ਰੱਖਦੇ ਹੋਏ"", which I think means ""when placed on"", so maybe it's including the boundary. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the original question says ""ਵਿਚਾਰ ਨੂੰ ਵਿਚਾਰੋ"", which might mean ""consider the rectangle and count the points"". Maybe it's better to assume it's including the boundary unless specified otherwise. But the user later says ""ਹੋਣਗੇ"" which is ""will be"", so maybe it's including the boundary. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should calculate both and see.

But let's proceed step by step. The rectangle spans from x = -5 to x = 5 and y = -4 to y = 4. So, the integer x-coordinates inside this range would be from -4 to 4, because if we include -5 and 5, they are on the boundary. Wait, no, if the rectangle includes the boundary, then x can be from -5 to 5 inclusive, and y from -4 to 4 inclusive. But if it's excluding the boundary, then x would be from -4 to 4, and y from -3 to 3. Hmm, I think I need to clarify.

Wait, the rectangle is defined by the four points, which are the corners. So, the sides are at x = -5, x = 5, y = -4, and y = 4. So, the interior would be where x is between -5 and 5, but not including -5 and 5, and y between -4 and 4, not including -4 and 4. So, the integer x-coordinates would be from -4 to 4, inclusive, and y-coordinates from -3 to 3, inclusive.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the rectangle is defined by the points (5,4), (-5,4), etc., then the interior points would have x strictly between -5 and 5, and y strictly between -4 and 4. So, for x, the integer values would be from -4 to 4, inclusive, because -5 is excluded and 5 is excluded. Similarly, for y, the integer values would be from -3 to 3, inclusive, because -4 is excluded and 4 is excluded.

So, the number of integer x-values is from -4 to 4. Let's count them: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 9 values.

Similarly, for y, from -3 to 3: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 7 values.

So, the total number of interior points would be 9 (x-values) multiplied by 7 (y-values), which is 63.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm correct. Let me check again. If the rectangle includes the boundary, then x would be from -5 to 5, which is 11 values, and y from -4 to 4, which is 9 values, giving 99 points. But if it's excluding the boundary, then it's 9 x 7 = 63.

But the problem says ""ਅੰਦਰ ਕਿੰਨੇ ਬਿੰਦੂ ਪੂਰਨ ਅੰਕ ਕੋਆਰਡੀਨੇਟਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਸਖਤੀ ਨਾਲ ਹੋਣਗੇ"". The word ""ਅੰਦਰ"" usually means ""inside"", which would exclude the boundary. So, I think the correct count is 63.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's think about the rectangle defined by (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4). So, the sides are at x = -5, x = 5, y = -4, and y = 4. So, the interior points would satisfy -5 < x < 5 and -4 < y < 4. So, x can be -4, -3, ..., 3, 4, which is 9 values, and y can be -3, -2, ..., 2, 3, which is 7 values. So, 9*7=63.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 63.
</think>

The rectangle is defined by the points (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), and (5,-4). The interior points are those where the x-coordinates range from -4 to 4 (inclusive) and the y-coordinates range from -3 to 3 (inclusive). 

- Number of x-values: 9 (from -4 to 4)
- Number of y-values: 7 (from -3 to 3)

Total number of interior points: 9 * 7 = 63.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compute the cross product of two vectors, specifically (2b - a) × (3c + a). They've given me the cross products of a, b, and c pairwise: a×b, a×c, and b×c. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that cross products follow the distributive property over addition and scalar multiplication. So, I can expand this expression step by step. Let me write that out:

(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, cross product is linear in both arguments, so I can distribute it like that. Now, let's compute each term one by one.

First term: 2b × 3c. Since scalar multiplication can be factored out, this is (2×3)(b × c) = 6(b × c). They've given me b × c as [1, -7, 18]. So, 6 times that vector would be [6×1, 6×(-7), 6×18] = [6, -42, 108].

Second term: 2b × a. Hmm, cross product is anti-commutative, meaning a × b = - (b × a). So, 2b × a = 2(a × b). Wait, no, hold on. Let me clarify. If I have 2b × a, that's equal to 2(b × a) = 2(-a × b) = -2(a × b). Since a × b is given as [6, -7, 3], multiplying by -2 gives [-12, 14, -6].

Third term: -a × 3c. Similarly, this is -3(a × c). They've given a × c as [4, 7, 2], so multiplying by -3 gives [-12, -21, -6].

Fourth term: -a × a. Hmm, cross product of any vector with itself is zero. So, this term is just 0.

Now, let me write down all the computed terms:

1. 6(b × c) = [6, -42, 108]
2. -2(a × b) = [-12, 14, -6]
3. -3(a × c) = [-12, -21, -6]
4. 0

Now, I need to add these vectors together. Let's add the first two terms:

[6, -42, 108] + [-12, 14, -6] = [6 - 12, -42 + 14, 108 - 6] = [-6, -28, 102]

Now, add the third term:

[-6, -28, 102] + [-12, -21, -6] = [-6 -12, -28 -21, 102 -6] = [-18, -49, 96]

And then add the fourth term, which is zero, so it doesn't change anything.

So, putting it all together, the result is [-18, -49, 96].

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

First term: 6*(1, -7, 18) = (6, -42, 108). That seems right.

Second term: -2*(6, -7, 3) = (-12, 14, -6). Correct.

Third term: -3*(4, 7, 2) = (-12, -21, -6). Correct.

Adding the first and second terms: (6 -12, -42 +14, 108 -6) = (-6, -28, 102). That's correct.

Adding the third term: (-6 -12, -28 -21, 102 -6) = (-18, -49, 96). Yep, that looks right.

So, I think that's the final answer. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything.

1. Expanded the cross product using distributive property.
2. Factored out scalars from each term.
3. Used the given cross products and scalar multiplication to compute each term.
4. Applied the anti-commutative property where necessary.
5. Added the resulting vectors component-wise.
6. Verified each step for arithmetic accuracy.

I don't see any mistakes in the process or calculations, so I'm confident that the result is correct.

**Final Answer**
The cross product is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.
</think>

To compute the cross product \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of the cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

We compute each term separately:

1. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}\)
2. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)
3. \(-\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)
4. \(-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\)

Adding these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}

"Alright, so I have this problem about a trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. They've given me that AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC divides the angle BAD into two parts. The area of the trapezoid is 42, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch the trapezoid. Since AD is parallel to BC, I can imagine AD as the top base and BC as the bottom base. So, points A and D are on the top, and B and C are on the bottom. Now, AC is a diagonal that connects A to C, and it's perpendicular to CD. That means at point C, the diagonal AC forms a right angle with side CD. Also, AC divides angle BAD into two parts. So, angle BAC and angle CAD are the two parts.

Let me label the points: A is the top-left corner, B is the bottom-left, C is the bottom-right, and D is the top-right. So, AD is the top base, BC is the bottom base, and AB and CD are the legs. Wait, but in a trapezoid, only one pair of sides is parallel, so AD || BC, and AB and CD are the non-parallel sides.

Given that AC is perpendicular to CD, so triangle ACD is a right triangle at C. That might be useful. Also, since AC divides angle BAD, which is at point A, into two angles. So, angle BAC and angle CAD are both present.

I think I need to assign some variables to the sides to make this more concrete. Let me denote the length of AD as 'a' and BC as 'b'. The height of the trapezoid, which is the distance between the two bases AD and BC, can be denoted as 'h'. The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula:

Area = (1/2) * (a + b) * h = 42

So, (a + b) * h = 84.

Now, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is a right triangle. So, the area of triangle ACD is (1/2) * CD * AC. But I don't know CD or AC yet.

Wait, but maybe I can express CD and AC in terms of the trapezoid's sides. Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points can help.

Let me place point A at (0, 0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and assuming AD is horizontal, I can place point D at (a, 0). Now, since AC is perpendicular to CD, and point C is on BC, which is the lower base. Let me denote point C as (c, h), because the height is h, and it's on the lower base. Then, point B would be somewhere on the lower base, but since BC is parallel to AD, which is horizontal, BC is also horizontal. So, point B would be at (c - b, h), because BC has length b.

Wait, let me make sure. If AD is from (0,0) to (a,0), then BC is from (c - b, h) to (c, h). So, the length of BC is b, which is correct.

Now, point C is at (c, h), and point D is at (a, 0). So, the vector CD is from C to D: (a - c, -h). The vector AC is from A to C: (c, h). Since AC is perpendicular to CD, their dot product should be zero.

So, AC • CD = 0.

Calculating the dot product:

(c)(a - c) + (h)(-h) = 0

So, c(a - c) - h² = 0

Which simplifies to:

ac - c² - h² = 0

So, ac = c² + h²

Hmm, that's one equation.

Also, since AC divides angle BAD into two parts, angle BAC and angle CAD. So, the diagonal AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD.

Wait, angle BAD is at point A, between BA and AD. Since AD is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (a,0), and BA goes from (0,0) to (c - b, h). So, the angle between BA and AD is being bisected by AC.

So, by the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides.

In triangle BAD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so:

AB / AD = BC / CD

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the angle bisector theorem. It states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But in this case, triangle BAD has angle at A, and the bisector AC meets BD at point C. Wait, but BD is not necessarily a side of the trapezoid. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, since AC is the angle bisector, the ratio of AB to AD is equal to the ratio of BC to CD.

Wait, AB is the length from A to B, which is sqrt[(c - b - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2] = sqrt[(c - b)^2 + h²]

AD is the length from A to D, which is 'a'.

BC is the length from B to C, which is 'b'.

CD is the length from C to D, which is sqrt[(a - c)^2 + h²]

So, according to the angle bisector theorem:

AB / AD = BC / CD

So,

sqrt[(c - b)^2 + h²] / a = b / sqrt[(a - c)^2 + h²]

Cross-multiplying:

sqrt[(c - b)^2 + h²] * sqrt[(a - c)^2 + h²] = a * b

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is right-angled at C. So, in triangle ACD, angle at C is 90 degrees. So, by Pythagoras theorem:

AC² + CD² = AD²

But AD is the length from A to D, which is 'a'. So,

AC² + CD² = a²

But AC is the diagonal from A to C, which is sqrt[c² + h²], and CD is sqrt[(a - c)^2 + h²]. So,

(c² + h²) + [(a - c)^2 + h²] = a²

Simplify:

c² + h² + (a² - 2ac + c²) + h² = a²

Combine like terms:

c² + c² - 2ac + a² + h² + h² = a²

So,

2c² - 2ac + a² + 2h² = a²

Subtract a² from both sides:

2c² - 2ac + 2h² = 0

Divide both sides by 2:

c² - ac + h² = 0

Wait, this is the same equation I got earlier from the dot product. So, that's consistent.

So, from the angle bisector theorem, I have:

sqrt[(c - b)^2 + h²] / a = b / sqrt[(a - c)^2 + h²]

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

[(c - b)^2 + h²] / a² = b² / [(a - c)^2 + h²]

Cross-multiplying:

[(c - b)^2 + h²] * [(a - c)^2 + h²] = a² b²

This seems quite involved. Maybe I can find a relationship between c and a, h, b.

From the earlier equation, c² - a c + h² = 0, so h² = a c - c².

Let me substitute h² into the equation above.

So, [(c - b)^2 + (a c - c²)] * [(a - c)^2 + (a c - c²)] = a² b²

Simplify each bracket:

First bracket: (c - b)^2 + a c - c²

= c² - 2 b c + b² + a c - c²

= -2 b c + b² + a c

= c(a - 2 b) + b²

Second bracket: (a - c)^2 + a c - c²

= a² - 2 a c + c² + a c - c²

= a² - a c

So, the equation becomes:

[c(a - 2 b) + b²] * [a² - a c] = a² b²

Let me factor out 'a' from the second bracket:

= [c(a - 2 b) + b²] * a(a - c) = a² b²

Divide both sides by 'a' (assuming a ≠ 0):

[c(a - 2 b) + b²] * (a - c) = a b²

Let me expand the left side:

[c(a - 2 b) + b²] * (a - c)

= [c a - 2 b c + b²] * (a - c)

Multiply term by term:

= c a (a - c) - 2 b c (a - c) + b² (a - c)

= c a² - c² a - 2 a b c + 2 b c² + a b² - b² c

Now, let's collect like terms:

- Terms with c a²: c a²

- Terms with c² a: -c² a + 2 b c²

- Terms with a b c: -2 a b c

- Terms with a b²: a b²

- Terms with b² c: -b² c

So, putting it all together:

c a² + (-c² a + 2 b c²) + (-2 a b c) + a b² - b² c

= c a² - a c² + 2 b c² - 2 a b c + a b² - b² c

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can factor some terms.

Let me factor c from the first two terms:

c(a² - a c) + 2 b c² - 2 a b c + a b² - b² c

Wait, from earlier, we have h² = a c - c², so a c - c² = h². So, a² - a c = a(a - c). Maybe that can be substituted.

But perhaps another approach is better. Let me recall that the area of the trapezoid is 42, which is (1/2)(a + b) h = 42, so (a + b) h = 84.

From the earlier equation, c² - a c + h² = 0, so h² = a c - c².

So, h = sqrt(a c - c²). Let me keep that in mind.

Also, from the angle bisector theorem, we have:

sqrt[(c - b)^2 + h²] / a = b / sqrt[(a - c)^2 + h²]

But since h² = a c - c², let's substitute that in.

So, sqrt[(c - b)^2 + (a c - c²)] / a = b / sqrt[(a - c)^2 + (a c - c²)]

Simplify the numerator and denominator inside the square roots.

First, numerator inside sqrt:

(c - b)^2 + a c - c²

= c² - 2 b c + b² + a c - c²

= -2 b c + b² + a c

= c(a - 2 b) + b²

Denominator inside sqrt:

(a - c)^2 + a c - c²

= a² - 2 a c + c² + a c - c²

= a² - a c

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[c(a - 2 b) + b²] / a = b / sqrt[a² - a c]

Cross-multiplying:

sqrt[c(a - 2 b) + b²] * sqrt[a² - a c] = a b

Square both sides:

[c(a - 2 b) + b²] * [a² - a c] = a² b²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier. So, I'm going in circles.

Maybe I need to find a relationship between a, b, c, h.

From h² = a c - c², so h = sqrt(c(a - c)).

Also, from the area of the trapezoid: (a + b) h = 84.

So, (a + b) sqrt(c(a - c)) = 84.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, maybe I can express c in terms of a and b.

From the equation c(a - 2 b) + b² = [a² - a c] * (something). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume some values to simplify.

Wait, maybe it's a right trapezoid? But no, only AC is perpendicular to CD.

Wait, but if AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC is a diagonal, then maybe triangle ACD is right-angled, which it is.

Wait, maybe I can express the area of triangle ACD in terms of the trapezoid area.

The area of the trapezoid is 42, which is the sum of the areas of triangles ABC and ACD.

Wait, is that true? Let me see.

In trapezoid ABCD, the diagonal AC divides it into two triangles: ABC and ACD. So, the area of ABCD is the sum of the areas of ABC and ACD.

So, [ABCD] = [ABC] + [ACD] = 42.

So, if I can find [ABC], then [ACD] = 42 - [ABC].

But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of areas of ABC and ACD.

Since AC is the angle bisector, maybe the areas are in some ratio.

Wait, in triangle BAD, AC is the angle bisector, so the ratio of areas of triangles ABC and ACD would be equal to the ratio of AB to AD.

Wait, is that correct? Because in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But in this case, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD in triangle BAD, so it divides BD into segments proportional to AB and AD.

Wait, but BD is not a side of the trapezoid. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.

Alternatively, since AC is the angle bisector, the ratio of areas of triangles ABC and ADC would be equal to the ratio of AB to AD.

Wait, let me think. In triangle BAD, with angle bisector AC, the ratio of areas of triangles ABC and ADC is equal","[42, '42']",28,"[28, '28']",False
"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: √(2x) divided by √(3x - 1) equals 3/2. Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better. 

So, it's √(2x) / √(3x - 1) = 3/2. I need to find the value of x. Alright, let's think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when you have a fraction with square roots in both numerator and denominator, you can combine them into a single square root. So, maybe I can rewrite the left side as √(2x / (3x - 1)). Let me check that. Yes, because √a / √b is equal to √(a/b). So, that simplifies the equation a bit.

So now, the equation is √(2x / (3x - 1)) = 3/2. To get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. That should help me solve for x. 

Squaring both sides gives me (2x / (3x - 1)) = (3/2)². Calculating the right side, (3/2) squared is 9/4. So now, the equation is 2x / (3x - 1) = 9/4.

Next, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can cross-multiply. So, multiplying both sides by (3x - 1) gives me 2x = (9/4)(3x - 1). Let me write that out: 2x = (9/4)(3x - 1). 

Now, I can distribute the 9/4 on the right side. So, 2x = (9/4)*3x - (9/4)*1. Calculating each term, (9/4)*3x is (27/4)x, and (9/4)*1 is 9/4. So, the equation becomes 2x = (27/4)x - 9/4.

Hmm, now I have 2x on the left and (27/4)x minus 9/4 on the right. I need to get all the x terms on one side. Let me subtract (27/4)x from both sides to move it to the left. 

So, 2x - (27/4)x = -9/4. To combine the x terms, I should express 2x as a fraction with denominator 4. 2x is the same as 8/4 x. So, 8/4 x - 27/4 x is (8 - 27)/4 x, which is (-19/4)x. 

So now, the equation is (-19/4)x = -9/4. To solve for x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (-19/4), which is (-4/19). 

Multiplying both sides by (-4/19) gives x = (-9/4) * (-4/19). Let's compute that. The negatives cancel out, so it's positive. The 4 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving 9/19. 

Wait, let me double-check that. (-9/4) * (-4/19) is indeed (9*4)/(4*19), and the 4s cancel, so it's 9/19. So, x equals 9/19. 

But hold on, I should make sure that this solution is valid in the original equation. Because when dealing with square roots, sometimes extraneous solutions can pop up. So, let me plug x = 9/19 back into the original equation to verify.

First, compute the numerator: √(2x) = √(2*(9/19)) = √(18/19). Then, the denominator: √(3x - 1) = √(3*(9/19) - 1) = √(27/19 - 19/19) = √(8/19). 

So, the left side of the equation becomes √(18/19) divided by √(8/19). That simplifies to √(18/19) / √(8/19) = √(18/19 * 19/8) = √(18/8) = √(9/4) = 3/2. 

Which matches the right side of the equation, so x = 9/19 is indeed a valid solution. 

Therefore, after solving and verifying, the solution is x = 9/19.
</think>

To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x - 1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), follow these steps:

1. **Combine the square roots:**
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{2x}{3x - 1}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

2. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

3. **Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   2x \times 4 = 9 \times (3x - 1)
   \]
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

4. **Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}

"Alright, so I have this problem where there are four points, A, B, C, and D, placed randomly on the circumference of a circle. The question is asking for the probability that the chords AB and CD intersect each other. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when you have points on a circle, the way they're arranged can determine whether the chords they form intersect. So, if I have four points on a circle, there are different ways they can be placed, and each placement can lead to different outcomes regarding the chords.

I think the key here is to figure out all the possible ways the four points can be arranged around the circle and then determine in how many of those arrangements the chords AB and CD intersect. Since the points are placed randomly, each arrangement is equally likely, so the probability will be the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of possible arrangements.

Let me start by considering the total number of ways to arrange four points on a circle. Since the circle has rotational symmetry, the number of distinct arrangements is actually (4-1)! = 6. Wait, no, that's for circular permutations where rotations are considered the same. But in this case, since the points are labeled (A, B, C, D), each distinct arrangement is unique regardless of rotation. So maybe the total number of arrangements is 4! = 24. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, actually, for circular arrangements where rotations are considered the same, the number is (n-1)! So for four points, it's 3! = 6. But since the points are labeled, each arrangement is unique, so maybe it's 4! = 24. I think I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to fix one point and arrange the others relative to it. Let's fix point A at a certain position on the circle. Then, the remaining three points (B, C, D) can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways around the circle. So, the total number of distinct arrangements is 6.

Now, out of these 6 arrangements, how many result in chords AB and CD intersecting? For two chords to intersect, the four points must be arranged in such a way that one chord is inside the circle and the other is outside, or something like that. Wait, no, more precisely, for two chords AB and CD to intersect, the points must alternate around the circle. That is, if you go around the circle, you encounter A, then C, then B, then D, or some similar alternating pattern.

So, if I fix point A, the other points can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. Let's list them:

1. A, B, C, D
2. A, B, D, C
3. A, C, B, D
4. A, C, D, B
5. A, D, B, C
6. A, D, C, B

Now, in which of these arrangements do the chords AB and CD intersect?

Let's visualize each case:

1. A, B, C, D: The order is A, B, C, D. So, chord AB is between A and B, and chord CD is between C and D. These chords don't cross each other because they are adjacent.

2. A, B, D, C: The order is A, B, D, C. Chord AB is between A and B, and chord CD is between D and C. Again, these chords don't cross each other.

3. A, C, B, D: The order is A, C, B, D. Chord AB connects A to B, passing through the interior of the circle, and chord CD connects C to D, which is between C and D. Wait, but in this arrangement, C is between A and B, and D is after B. So, chord CD would be between C and D, which are on opposite sides of AB. So, do they intersect? Let me think. If you have A, C, B, D, then chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. Since C is between A and B, and D is after B, chord CD would cross AB somewhere inside the circle. So, yes, they intersect.

4. A, C, D, B: The order is A, C, D, B. Chord AB connects A to B, which is after D. Chord CD connects C to D. So, chord AB goes from A to B, passing through the interior, and chord CD is between C and D, which are adjacent. Do they intersect? Let me visualize: A, C, D, B. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is after D. Chord CD is from C to D. Since C is between A and D, and D is between C and B, chord CD is between C and D, which are adjacent, so chord AB would pass through the interior, but chord CD is on the outside. So, they don't intersect.

Wait, no, actually, if the order is A, C, D, B, then chord AB is from A to B, which is after D. Chord CD is from C to D. So, chord AB would pass through the interior, and chord CD is between C and D, which are next to each other. So, they don't intersect.

5. A, D, B, C: The order is A, D, B, C. Chord AB connects A to B, which is after D. Chord CD connects C to D, which is between A and B. So, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. Since C is after B, chord CD would be from C to D, which is between A and B. So, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D, which is on the other side. Do they intersect? Let me think. If you have A, D, B, C, then chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. Since D is between A and B, and C is after B, chord CD would be from C to D, which is on the opposite side of AB. So, they would cross each other inside the circle. So, yes, they intersect.

6. A, D, C, B: The order is A, D, C, B. Chord AB connects A to B, which is after C. Chord CD connects C to D, which is between A and C. So, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. Since D is between A and C, and C is between D and B, chord CD is between C and D, which are adjacent. So, chord AB would pass through the interior, but chord CD is on the outside. So, they don't intersect.

Wait, no, actually, if the order is A, D, C, B, then chord AB is from A to B, which is after C. Chord CD is from C to D, which is between A and C. So, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. Since D is between A and C, and C is between D and B, chord CD is from C to D, which is on the opposite side of AB. So, chord AB would pass through the interior, and chord CD would be on the other side. So, they don't intersect.

Wait, but in arrangement 3, A, C, B, D, chords AB and CD do intersect. In arrangement 5, A, D, B, C, chords AB and CD also intersect. So, out of the 6 possible arrangements, 2 result in intersecting chords.

Wait, but I thought earlier that maybe it's 1/3, but according to this, it's 2 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/3. But I'm not sure if I'm considering all possible cases correctly.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Instead of fixing point A, perhaps I should consider all possible pairs of chords and see how they can intersect. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a known probability for this.

I recall that for four points on a circle, the probability that two chords intersect is 1/3. So, maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me try to confirm this. If I have four points on a circle, the number of ways to pair them into two chords is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Out of these three pairings, only one pairing results in intersecting chords. So, the probability is 1/3.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the total number of ways to pair four points into two chords is 3, and only one of those pairings results in intersecting chords. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But in my earlier approach, I fixed point A and found that 2 out of 6 arrangements result in intersecting chords, which is also 1/3. So, both methods give the same result.

Therefore, the probability that chords AB and CD intersect is 1/3.

The probability that chords $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}$.","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"Alright, so I have this problem about two circles in a diagram. Both circles have their centers at point D. The smaller circle has a radius of 1, and the larger one has a radius of 2. The problem mentions something about the shaded area being 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of angle ADC in degrees.

First, let me try to visualize the diagram. There's a smaller circle with radius 1 and a larger circle with radius 2, both centered at D. Points A and C are on the larger circle, and point A is also on the smaller circle. The diagram shows two arcs: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle, creating a shaded region. The angle ADC is the angle at the center D between points A and C.

So, the shaded area is the region between the two arcs. It's like a lens-shaped area formed by the intersection of the two circles. The problem states that this shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. The larger circle has a radius of 2, so its area is π*(2)^2 = 4π. Therefore, the shaded area should be (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

Now, I need to find the measure of angle ADC. Let's denote angle ADC as θ. Since both circles are centered at D, triangle ADC is a triangle with sides DA = 2 (radius of the larger circle), DC = 2 (radius of the larger circle), and AC = 1 (radius of the smaller circle). Wait, hold on, AC is the radius of the smaller circle, which is 1. So, triangle ADC has two sides of length 2 and one side of length 1.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. If A and C are both on the larger circle, then DA and DC are both radii of the larger circle, so they should both be 2. But point A is also on the smaller circle, so the distance from A to D is 1? Wait, no, the smaller circle has radius 1, so if A is on the smaller circle, then DA is 1. But if A is also on the larger circle, which has radius 2, then DA should be 2. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, ""ਦੋ ਗੋਲਕ, ਹਰ ਇੱਕ ਦਾ ਕੇਂਦਰ D ਹੈ, ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਅਰਧਵਿਆਸ 1 ਅਤੇ 2 ਹਨ."" So, the two circles have centers at D, and their semicircles are 1 and 2. Wait, semicircles? Or is it that the arcs are 1 and 2? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the Asymptote code is given. Let me look at it. It defines point a as 2*dir(100), which is a point on the larger circle (radius 2) at an angle of 100 degrees. Point c is (2,0), which is on the larger circle as well. Then, it draws an arc from a/2 with radius a/2, which is 1, and another arc from c with radius 2. So, the smaller circle has radius 1, and the larger one has radius 2.

So, point A is on the larger circle (radius 2) and also on the smaller circle (radius 1). That means the distance from D to A is both 2 and 1? That can't be. Wait, no, the smaller circle is centered at D with radius 1, and the larger circle is also centered at D with radius 2. So, point A is on both circles? That would mean that A is at a distance of 1 from D and 2 from D, which is impossible unless D is at two different places. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the smaller circle is not centered at D. Wait, the problem says both circles have their centers at D. So, both circles are centered at D, one with radius 1 and the other with radius 2. So, point A is on the smaller circle, so DA = 1, and point C is on the larger circle, so DC = 2. But in the Asymptote code, point a is 2*dir(100), which is on the larger circle, and point c is (2,0), which is also on the larger circle. So, point A is on the larger circle, and point C is also on the larger circle. But the smaller circle is centered at D with radius 1, so point A is also on the smaller circle? That would mean DA = 1, but point A is on the larger circle, so DA = 2. That's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the smaller circle is not centered at D. Wait, the problem says both circles have their centers at D. So, both circles are centered at D, one with radius 1 and the other with radius 2. So, point A is on the smaller circle, so DA = 1, and point C is on the larger circle, so DC = 2. But in the Asymptote code, point a is 2*dir(100), which is on the larger circle, and point c is (2,0), which is also on the larger circle. So, point A is on the larger circle, and point C is on the larger circle. But the smaller circle is centered at D with radius 1, so point A is also on the smaller circle? That would mean DA = 1, but point A is on the larger circle, so DA = 2. That's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is not matching the problem statement. Let me check again. The problem says both circles have centers at D, with semicircles 1 and 2. The Asymptote code draws two arcs: one from a/2 with radius a/2 (which is 1) and another from c with radius 2. So, the smaller circle is centered at a/2, not at D. Hmm, maybe the Asymptote code is different.

Wait, the Asymptote code defines point d as (0,0), which is the center D. Then, point a is 2*dir(100), which is on the larger circle (radius 2). Point c is (2,0), which is also on the larger circle. Then, it draws an arc from a/2 with radius a/2, which is 1, and another arc from c with radius 2. So, the smaller circle is centered at a/2, which is a point on the larger circle, and the larger circle is centered at D (0,0) with radius 2.

Wait, so the smaller circle is not centered at D, but at a/2, which is a point on the larger circle. So, the smaller circle is centered at a point that's 1 unit away from D, since a is on the larger circle (radius 2), so a/2 is 1 unit away from D. So, the smaller circle is centered at a point 1 unit away from D, with radius 1. So, it's a circle that touches D, because the distance from a/2 to D is 1, and the radius is 1, so it just touches D.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says both circles have centers at D. So, maybe the Asymptote code is incorrect, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the smaller circle is centered at D, but the arc is drawn from a different center.

Wait, the problem says both circles have centers at D, with semicircles 1 and 2. So, the smaller circle has radius 1, centered at D, and the larger circle has radius 2, also centered at D. So, point A is on the smaller circle, so DA = 1, and point C is on the larger circle, so DC = 2. But in the Asymptote code, point a is 2*dir(100), which is on the larger circle, and point c is (2,0), which is also on the larger circle. So, point A is on the larger circle, but the smaller circle is centered at D with radius 1, so point A is also on the smaller circle? That can't be, unless point A is at distance 1 from D and 2 from D, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is not matching the problem. Maybe the smaller circle is not centered at D. Let me check the problem statement again: ""ਦੋ ਗੋਲਕ, ਹਰ ਇੱਕ ਦਾ ਕੇਂਦਰ D ਹੈ, ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਅਰਧਵਿਆਸ 1 ਅਤੇ 2 ਹਨ."" So, both circles have centers at D, with semicircles 1 and 2. So, the smaller circle has radius 1, centered at D, and the larger circle has radius 2, also centered at D.

Therefore, in the Asymptote code, point a is on the larger circle (radius 2), and point c is on the larger circle as well. The smaller circle is centered at D, so point a is not on the smaller circle unless DA = 1, but DA is 2 because point a is on the larger circle. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is incorrect, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it.

Alternatively, maybe the smaller circle is not centered at D, but at another point. Wait, the problem says both circles have centers at D, so the smaller circle is centered at D with radius 1, and the larger circle is centered at D with radius 2. So, point A is on the smaller circle, so DA = 1, and point C is on the larger circle, so DC = 2. But in the Asymptote code, point a is 2*dir(100), which is on the larger circle, and point c is (2,0), which is also on the larger circle. So, point A is on the larger circle, but the smaller circle is centered at D with radius 1, so point A is also on the smaller circle? That can't be.

Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is using a different coordinate system. Let me see. The Asymptote code defines point d as (0,0), point a as 2*dir(100), which is (2*cos(100°), 2*sin(100°)), and point c as (2,0). Then, it draws an arc from a/2 with radius a/2, which is 1, and another arc from c with radius 2. So, the smaller circle is centered at a/2, which is (cos(100°), sin(100°)), and the larger circle is centered at d (0,0) with radius 2.

So, in this case, the smaller circle is not centered at D, but at a/2, which is a point on the larger circle. So, the smaller circle is centered at a point 1 unit away from D, with radius 1. So, it touches D because the distance from a/2 to D is 1, and the radius is 1. So, the smaller circle is tangent to the larger circle at point D.

Wait, but the problem says both circles have centers at D. So, maybe the Asymptote code is incorrect, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about two circles with centers at D, one with radius 1 and the other with radius 2, and the shaded area is the intersection or something else.

Wait, the problem says ""ਛਾਂਵ ਵਾਲੇ ਖੇਤਰ ਦਾ ਕੁੱਲ ਖੇਤਰਫਲ ਵੱਡੇ ਗੋਲਕ ਦੇ ਖੇਤਰਫਲ ਦਾ 5/12 ਹੈ."" So, the shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. The larger circle has radius 2, so its area is 4π, so the shaded area is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

So, the shaded area is the area between the two arcs. It's like a lens shape formed by the intersection of the two circles. So, to find the area of the shaded region, we can use the formula for the area of intersection of two circles.

The formula for the area of intersection of two circles with radii r and R, and distance between centers d, is:

Area = r² cos⁻¹((d² + r² - R²)/(2dr)) + R² cos⁻¹((d² + R² - r²)/(2dR)) - 0.5*sqrt((-d + r + R)(d + r - R)(d - r + R)(d + r + R))

But in this case, both circles are centered at D, so the distance between centers is 0. Wait, that can't be. If both circles are centered at D, then they are concentric circles, and their intersection is the entire smaller circle. But the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is more than the area of the smaller circle (which is π*1² = π). 5/12 of 4π is (5/3)π, which is approximately 5.23, while the area of the smaller circle is π, which is about 3.14. So, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the shaded area is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle? But 4π - π = 3π, which is about 9.42, which is more than 5/12 of 4π. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is the area of the annulus between the two circles, but that would be 4π - π = 3π, which is not 5/12 of 4π.

Wait, maybe the shaded area is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle. But since both circles are centered at D, the sectors would have the same angle, so the area difference would be (R² - r²)*(θ/2), where θ is the angle in radians.

But the problem says the shaded area is 5/12 of the area of","[5/12, '5/12']",120,"[120, '120']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to compute the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might help here. I remember that there are formulas for the sine of a sum and the sine of a difference. Specifically, the sine addition formula is \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), and the sine subtraction formula is \(\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B\). So, maybe I can apply these formulas to both parts of the expression.

Let me denote \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\). That way, the expression becomes \(\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)\). That seems a bit simpler to handle.

So, first, I need to compute \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) separately, and then multiply them together. Let me start with \(\sin(A + B)\).

Using the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
I know that \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). But I need \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\). Since \(A = \arcsin 0.4\), \(\cos A\) can be found using the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84}
\]
Similarly, for \(B = \arcsin 0.5\):
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75}
\]
So, plugging these back into the formula for \(\sin(A + B)\):
\[
\sin(A + B) = (0.4) \cdot \sqrt{0.75} + \sqrt{0.84} \cdot (0.5)
\]
Let me compute each term separately. First, \(0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75}\). I know that \(\sqrt{0.75}\) is the same as \(\sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660\). So, \(0.4 \times 0.8660 \approx 0.3464\).

Next, \(\sqrt{0.84}\) is approximately \(\sqrt{0.84} \approx 0.9165\). So, \(0.9165 \times 0.5 = 0.45825\).

Adding these two results together: \(0.3464 + 0.45825 \approx 0.80465\). So, \(\sin(A + B) \approx 0.80465\).

Now, let's compute \(\sin(A - B)\) using the sine subtraction formula:
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]
Again, substituting the known values:
\[
\sin(A - B) = (0.4) \cdot \sqrt{0.75} - \sqrt{0.84} \cdot (0.5)
\]
We already computed \(\sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.8660\) and \(\sqrt{0.84} \approx 0.9165\). So, plugging those in:
\[
0.4 \times 0.8660 \approx 0.3464
\]
and
\[
0.9165 \times 0.5 \approx 0.45825
\]
Subtracting the second term from the first:
\[
0.3464 - 0.45825 \approx -0.11185
\]
So, \(\sin(A - B) \approx -0.11185\).

Now, the original expression is the product of these two results:
\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \approx 0.80465 \times (-0.11185)
\]
Multiplying these together:
\[
0.80465 \times (-0.11185) \approx -0.0900
\]
Hmm, so the approximate value is about -0.09. But I wonder if there's a more exact way to compute this without approximating the square roots and products. Maybe I can express it in terms of exact radicals or find a way to simplify it symbolically.

Let me try that. Let's go back to the expressions for \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) without approximating the square roots.

We have:
\[
\sin(A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} + \sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5
\]
and
\[
\sin(A - B) = 0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} - \sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5
\]
Notice that these two expressions are of the form \(C + D\) and \(C - D\), where \(C = 0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75}\) and \(D = \sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5\). Therefore, their product is:
\[
(C + D)(C - D) = C^2 - D^2
\]
So, instead of multiplying the approximate decimal values, I can compute \(C^2 - D^2\) exactly.

Let's compute \(C^2\) and \(D^2\).

First, \(C = 0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75}\). So,
\[
C^2 = (0.4)^2 \cdot (\sqrt{0.75})^2 = 0.16 \cdot 0.75 = 0.12
\]
Next, \(D = \sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5\). So,
\[
D^2 = (\sqrt{0.84})^2 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 0.84 \cdot 0.25 = 0.21
\]
Therefore, the product is:
\[
C^2 - D^2 = 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]
So, the exact value is \(-0.09\). That's much cleaner and precise. So, the approximate calculation I did earlier was correct, and the exact value is \(-0.09\).

Therefore, the value of the original expression is \(-0.09\). But just to make sure, let me verify my steps again.

1. I set \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\).
2. I used the sine addition and subtraction formulas.
3. I expressed \(\sin(A + B)\) and \(\sin(A - B)\) in terms of \(\sin A\), \(\cos A\), \(\sin B\), and \(\cos B\).
4. I recognized that the product of these two expressions is of the form \((C + D)(C - D)\), which simplifies to \(C^2 - D^2\).
5. I computed \(C^2\) and \(D^2\) exactly, leading to the result \(-0.09\).

Everything seems to check out. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, I can confidently say that the value is \(-0.09\).

**Final Answer**
The value of the expression is \boxed{-0.09}.
</think>

To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by denoting \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\). This transforms the expression into \(\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]

We know:
\[
\sin A = 0.4, \quad \sin B = 0.5
\]
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{0.84}, \quad \cos B = \sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \sqrt{0.75}
\]

Using these values, we compute:
\[
\sin(A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} + \sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = 0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} - \sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5
\]

Recognizing that the product of these expressions is of the form \((C + D)(C - D)\), we have:
\[
(C + D)(C - D) = C^2 - D^2

"Alright, so I have this problem where there's a committee made up of 8 republicans and 6 democrats. I need to figure out how many ways I can form a subcommittee of 5 members, with the condition that each party has at least one representative. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I know that the total number of ways to choose 5 members out of 14 (since 8+6=14) without any restrictions is calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, C(14,5) would give me the total number of possible subcommittees without any restrictions.

But wait, the problem specifies that each party must have at least one member. That means I can't have all 5 members from just one party. So, I need to subtract the cases where all 5 are republicans or all 5 are democrats.

Let me calculate the number of ways to choose all republicans. That would be C(8,5), since there are 8 republicans. Similarly, the number of ways to choose all democrats is C(6,5), because there are 6 democrats.

So, the total number of valid subcommittees would be the total combinations minus the all-republican and all-democrat combinations. That is, C(14,5) - C(8,5) - C(6,5).

Let me compute these values step by step. First, C(14,5):

C(14,5) = 14! / (5! * 9!) = (14*13*12*11*10) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 2002.

Next, C(8,5):

C(8,5) = 8! / (5! * 3!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56.

Then, C(6,5):

C(6,5) = 6! / (5! * 1!) = 6.

So, subtracting these from the total: 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes with combinations, it's easy to mix up the numbers. Let me verify each step again.

C(14,5) is indeed 2002. C(8,5) is 56, and C(6,5) is 6. Subtracting 56 and 6 from 2002 gives 1940. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I could think about it using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of ways without restrictions is 2002. The number of ways where all are republicans is 56, and all are democrats is 6. So, subtracting these gives the number of ways where there's at least one from each party.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 1940 ways.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), I'll start by isolating the cube root.

First, I'll cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube root. This gives me \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\).

Calculating \(16^3\) results in 4096. So, the equation becomes \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\).

Next, I'll subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero: \(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\), which simplifies to \(x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\).

Now, I'll solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. The formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\).

Calculating the discriminant: \((-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384\).

Taking the square root of the discriminant gives \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\).

Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula: \(x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}\).

This results in two solutions: \(x = \frac{132}{2} = 66\) and \(x = \frac{-124}{2} = -62\).

Finally, I'll verify both solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.

1. **Cube Both Sides:**

2. **Rearrange the Equation:**

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the product of four cosine terms: \[\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right).\] Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or use some trigonometric identities to simplify it.

First, I notice that the angles inside the cosines are doubling each time: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 16π/15. That seems like a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2. Maybe I can use the double-angle formula or something related to multiple angles.

I remember that for multiple angles, especially when dealing with products of cosines, there are some product-to-sum identities, but I'm not sure if they will help here directly. Alternatively, maybe I can express these cosines in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula. That might make it easier to handle the product.

Euler's formula says that \(\cos \theta = \frac{e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}}{2}\). So, if I apply this to each cosine term, the product will become a product of four such expressions. That might get messy, but perhaps some terms will cancel out or combine nicely.

Let me write each cosine as a sum of exponentials:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{e^{i \cdot 2\pi/15} + e^{-i \cdot 2\pi/15}}{2},
\]
\[
\cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{e^{i \cdot 4\pi/15} + e^{-i \cdot 4\pi/15}}{2},
\]
\[
\cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{e^{i \cdot 8\pi/15} + e^{-i \cdot 8\pi/15}}{2},
\]
\[
\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{e^{i \cdot 16\pi/15} + e^{-i \cdot 16\pi/15}}{2}.
\]

So, the entire product becomes:

\[
\left( \frac{e^{i \cdot 2\pi/15} + e^{-i \cdot 2\pi/15}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{e^{i \cdot 4\pi/15} + e^{-i \cdot 4\pi/15}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{e^{i \cdot 8\pi/15} + e^{-i \cdot 8\pi/15}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{e^{i \cdot 16\pi/15} + e^{-i \cdot 16\pi/15}}{2} \right).
\]

That's a product of four binomials, each with two terms. Multiplying them out would result in \(2^4 = 16\) terms. That seems like a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or symmetry that can help simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can pair the terms in a clever way. Let me look at the exponents:

For the first term: \(2\pi/15\), second: \(4\pi/15\), third: \(8\pi/15\), fourth: \(16\pi/15\).

Wait, \(16\pi/15\) is the same as \(16\pi/15 - 2\pi = 16\pi/15 - 30\pi/15 = -14\pi/15\). So, \(\cos(16\pi/15) = \cos(-14\pi/15) = \cos(14\pi/15)\) because cosine is even. Similarly, \(14\pi/15 = \pi - \pi/15\), so \(\cos(14\pi/15) = -\cos(\pi/15)\). So, \(\cos(16\pi/15) = -\cos(\pi/15)\).

Similarly, let's see if I can express all the angles in terms of \(\pi/15\):

- \(2\pi/15\) is just \(2\pi/15\).
- \(4\pi/15\) is \(4\pi/15\).
- \(8\pi/15\) is \(8\pi/15\).
- \(16\pi/15\) is equivalent to \(-14\pi/15\), which is \(-14\pi/15 + 2\pi = 16\pi/15\), but as I saw earlier, it's equal to \(-\cos(\pi/15)\).

So, maybe I can write the product as:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cdot (-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)).
\]

So, the product becomes:

\[
- \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Hmm, that might be helpful. Now, I have a product of four cosines, each with angles that are multiples of \(\pi/15\). Maybe I can use the identity for multiple angles or some product formula.

I recall that for multiple angles, especially in the context of roots of unity, products of cosines can sometimes be expressed in terms of sine functions. There's a formula that relates the product of cosines to a ratio of sines. Let me try to recall that.

I think the formula is:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sin \left( \frac{k \pi}{n} \right) = \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}.
\]

But that's for sines. Is there a similar formula for cosines?

Alternatively, I remember that the product of cosines can sometimes be expressed using the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( 2^k x \right ) = \frac{\sin(2^n x)}{2^n \sin x}.
\]

Wait, that might be useful here. Let me check.

If I set \(x = \pi/15\), then \(2^n x\) would be \(2^n \cdot \pi/15\). Let's see:

For n=4, the product would be:

\[
\cos(x) \cos(2x) \cos(4x) \cos(8x) = \frac{\sin(16x)}{16 \sin x}.
\]

Yes, that seems right. So, substituting \(x = \pi/15\), we get:

\[
\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos\left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos\left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin\left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

So, that product is equal to \(\frac{\sin(16\pi/15)}{16 \sin(\pi/15)}\). Let me compute \(\sin(16\pi/15)\).

Since \(16\pi/15 = \pi + \pi/15\), and \(\sin(\pi + \theta) = -\sin \theta\). Therefore, \(\sin(16\pi/15) = -\sin(\pi/15)\).

So, substituting back, we have:

\[
\frac{\sin(16\pi/15)}{16 \sin(\pi/15)} = \frac{ - \sin(\pi/15) }{16 \sin(\pi/15)} = - \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Therefore, the product of the four cosines is \(-1/16\). But remember, earlier I had a negative sign outside, so the original product was:

\[
- \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = - \left( - \frac{1}{16} \right ) = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that.

Earlier, I had:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right ) = - \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right ).
\]

So, the original product is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right ) = \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right ) \cdot (- \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right )).
\]

So, that's equal to:

\[
- \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right ) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right ).
\]

And we found that the product inside is \(-1/16\), so:

\[
- (-1/16) = 1/16.
\]

Therefore, the original product is \(1/16\).

Wait, but let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with multiple angles, especially with negative angles, it's easy to make a mistake.

Let me recap:

1. Recognized that \(\cos(16\pi/15) = \cos(\pi + \pi/15) = -\cos(\pi/15)\).
2. Expressed the original product as \(- \cos(\pi/15) \cos(2\pi/15) \cos(4\pi/15) \cos(8\pi/15)\).
3. Applied the product formula for cosines: \(\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k x) = \frac{\sin(2^n x)}{2^n \sin x}\).
4. Substituted \(x = \pi/15\) and \(n=4\), so the product becomes \(\frac{\sin(16\pi/15)}{16 \sin(\pi/15)}\).
5. Simplified \(\sin(16\pi/15)\) to \(-\sin(\pi/15)\), leading to \(-1/16\).
6. Therefore, the original product is \(-(-1/16) = 1/16\).

That seems consistent. Let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using complex numbers or another identity.

Alternatively, I remember that for certain angles, especially those related to regular polygons, the product of cosines can be evaluated using properties of roots of unity.

The angles here are multiples of \(2\pi/15\), which is 24 degrees. 15 is a factor of 30, which is related to the regular 15-gon. Maybe there's a connection there.

But perhaps another approach is to use the identity for multiple angles. Let me consider using the identity for \(\sin(8\theta)\) or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: since the product of cosines is equal to \(-1/16\), but we have an extra negative sign from \(\cos(16\pi/15)\), so the overall product becomes positive \(1/16\). That seems plausible.

Alternatively, let me compute the numerical value to check.

Compute each cosine:

- \(\cos(2\pi/15)\): 2π is about 6.283, divided by 15 is approximately 0.4189 radians. Cos(0.4189) ≈ 0.9063.
- \(\cos(4\pi/15)\): 4π/15 ≈ 0.8377 radians. Cos(0.8377) ≈ 0.6691.
- \(\cos(8\pi/15)\): 8π/15 ≈ 1.6755 radians. Cos(1.6755) ≈ 0.06699.
- \(\cos(16\pi/15)\): 16π/15 ≈ 3.3510 radians. Cos(3.3510) ≈ -0.9945.

Multiply them together:

There's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, so DM must be 1 unit because AM is 11. The key condition given is that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

First, let me visualize the triangle. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base is BC, and AM is the altitude from A to BC, which also bisects BC because it's an isosceles triangle. So, point M is the midpoint of BC. Point D is on AM, closer to A since AD is 10 and DM is 1.

Let me denote angle BAC as θ. Then, angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow. Maybe using trigonometric identities or properties of triangles.

Since ABC is isosceles, angles at B and C are equal. Let's denote them as β. So, θ + 2β = 180°, which means β = (180° - θ)/2.

Now, looking at triangle BDC. Points B, D, and C form triangle BDC. I know that angle BDC is 3θ. Maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in triangle BDC.

But before that, let me note down the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let's place point A at (0, 11), M at (0, 0), so BC is on the x-axis. Then, point D is on AM, 10 units from A, so D is at (0, 1). Points B and C are symmetric about the y-axis, so let's say B is at (-k, 0) and C is at (k, 0). Then, BC has length 2k.

So, coordinates:
- A: (0, 11)
- M: (0, 0)
- D: (0, 1)
- B: (-k, 0)
- C: (k, 0)

Now, I can express the coordinates of D as (0,1). So, BD is the distance from B to D, which is sqrt[(-k - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2] = sqrt(k² + 1). Similarly, CD is sqrt[(k - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2] = sqrt(k² + 1). So, BD = CD, which makes triangle BDC isosceles with BD = CD.

Wait, that's interesting. So, triangle BDC is also isosceles with BD = CD, and angle at D is 3θ. So, the base angles at B and C in triangle BDC are equal. Let's denote them as φ. So, 3θ + 2φ = 180°, which means φ = (180° - 3θ)/2.

But I also know that in triangle ABC, angles at B and C are β = (180° - θ)/2. So, maybe I can relate φ and β somehow.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to find the angles. Let's compute vectors or slopes to find the angles.

First, let's find the coordinates again:

- A: (0,11)
- B: (-k,0)
- C: (k,0)
- D: (0,1)

So, vectors:

- Vector DB: from D(0,1) to B(-k,0): (-k, -1)
- Vector DC: from D(0,1) to C(k,0): (k, -1)

The angle at D, angle BDC, is the angle between vectors DB and DC. Since DB and DC are symmetric, the angle between them is 3θ.

Wait, but vectors DB and DC are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, so the angle between them is 2 times the angle each makes with the y-axis.

Alternatively, since vectors DB and DC are (-k, -1) and (k, -1), the angle between them can be found using the dot product.

Dot product of DB and DC is (-k)(k) + (-1)(-1) = -k² + 1.

The magnitude of DB is sqrt(k² + 1), same as DC.

So, the cosine of angle BDC is ( -k² + 1 ) / ( (sqrt(k² + 1))^2 ) = (1 - k²)/(k² + 1).

But angle BDC is 3θ, so:

cos(3θ) = (1 - k²)/(1 + k²)

Similarly, in triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ. Let's find cosθ.

In triangle ABC, angle at A is θ, sides AB = AC. Let's compute AB.

AB is the distance from A(0,11) to B(-k,0): sqrt( (0 - (-k))² + (11 - 0)² ) = sqrt(k² + 121).

Similarly, AC is the same. So, AB = AC = sqrt(k² + 121).

The base BC is 2k.

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 AB * AC * cosθ

But AB = AC, so:

(2k)² = 2*(k² + 121) - 2*(k² + 121)*cosθ

Simplify:

4k² = 2k² + 242 - 2(k² + 121)cosθ

Subtract 2k² + 242 from both sides:

4k² - 2k² - 242 = -2(k² + 121)cosθ

2k² - 242 = -2(k² + 121)cosθ

Divide both sides by -2:

- (k² - 121) = (k² + 121)cosθ

So,

cosθ = (121 - k²)/(121 + k²)

So, now we have expressions for cosθ and cos(3θ):

cosθ = (121 - k²)/(121 + k²)

cos(3θ) = (1 - k²)/(1 + k²)

But we also know that cos(3θ) can be expressed in terms of cosθ using the triple angle formula:

cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ

So, let's set up the equation:

4cos³θ - 3cosθ = (1 - k²)/(1 + k²)

But we have cosθ in terms of k², so let's substitute:

Let me denote x = k² for simplicity.

Then,

cosθ = (121 - x)/(121 + x)

So,

4[(121 - x)/(121 + x)]³ - 3[(121 - x)/(121 + x)] = (1 - x)/(1 + x)

This seems complicated, but let's try to compute it step by step.

Let me compute the left-hand side (LHS):

First, compute [(121 - x)/(121 + x)]³:

Let me denote y = (121 - x)/(121 + x)

Then, LHS = 4y³ - 3y

We can factor this as y(4y² - 3)

But maybe it's better to compute it directly.

Alternatively, let's compute 4[(121 - x)/(121 + x)]³ - 3[(121 - x)/(121 + x)] and set it equal to (1 - x)/(1 + x).

Let me write the equation:

4[(121 - x)/(121 + x)]³ - 3[(121 - x)/(121 + x)] = (1 - x)/(1 + x)

Let me denote z = (121 - x)/(121 + x). Then, the equation becomes:

4z³ - 3z = (1 - x)/(1 + x)

But z = (121 - x)/(121 + x). Let's express (1 - x)/(1 + x) in terms of z.

Wait, maybe it's better to cross-multiply and solve for x.

Let me write the equation as:

4[(121 - x)³]/[(121 + x)³] - 3[(121 - x)/(121 + x)] = (1 - x)/(1 + x)

Multiply both sides by (121 + x)³(1 + x) to eliminate denominators:

4(121 - x)³(1 + x) - 3(121 - x)(121 + x)³ = (1 - x)(121 + x)²

This seems very messy, but perhaps expanding each term would help.

Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can simplify this.

Let me consider that both sides involve expressions of (121 - x) and (1 + x). Maybe let me set t = x, so that we can write in terms of t.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach.

Wait, maybe instead of using coordinates, I can use trigonometric identities in triangle ABC and triangle BDC.

In triangle ABC, since it's isosceles with AB = AC, and AM is the altitude, so AM = 11, which is the height.

So, in triangle ABM, which is a right-angled triangle, we have:

AB² = AM² + BM²

AB² = 11² + BM²

But BM is half of BC, so BM = BC/2.

Let me denote BC = 2k, so BM = k.

Thus, AB² = 121 + k²

Similarly, in triangle ABC, using the Law of Sines:

AB / sinβ = BC / sinθ

But AB = sqrt(121 + k²), BC = 2k, and angle at B is β.

So,

sqrt(121 + k²) / sinβ = 2k / sinθ

But earlier, we had β = (180° - θ)/2, so sinβ = sin[(180° - θ)/2] = sin(90° - θ/2) = cos(θ/2)

So,

sqrt(121 + k²) / cos(θ/2) = 2k / sinθ

Cross-multiplying:

sqrt(121 + k²) * sinθ = 2k * cos(θ/2)

Hmm, this might be useful later.

Alternatively, in triangle BDC, which is also isosceles with BD = CD, angle at D is 3θ.

In triangle BDC, sides BD = CD = sqrt(k² + 1), as computed earlier.

So, using the Law of Sines in triangle BDC:

BD / sinφ = BC / sin(3θ)

Where φ is the base angle at B and C.

But BD = sqrt(k² + 1), BC = 2k, and angle at D is 3θ.

So,

sqrt(k² + 1) / sinφ = 2k / sin(3θ)

But in triangle ABC, angle at B is β, which is equal to (180° - θ)/2.

But in triangle BDC, angle at B is φ, which is equal to angle at C.

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at B is β, which is adjacent to side BM, which is k.

In triangle BDC, angle at B is φ, which is adjacent to side BD, which is sqrt(k² + 1).

Wait, maybe I can relate angles β and φ.

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at B is β, which is the angle between AB and BM.

In triangle BDC, angle at B is φ, which is the angle between BD and BC.

But I'm not sure if they are directly related.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle BDC.

In triangle BDC, sides BD = CD = sqrt(k² + 1), and BC = 2k.

So, applying the Law of Cosines:

BC² = BD² + CD² - 2 BD * CD * cos(3θ)

So,

(2k)² = (k² + 1) + (k² + 1) - 2*(sqrt(k² + 1))*(sqrt(k² + 1))*cos(3θ)

Simplify:

4k² = 2(k² + 1) - 2(k² + 1)cos(3θ)

Divide both sides by 2:

2k² = (k² + 1) - (k² + 1)cos(3θ)

Bring terms with cos(3θ) to one side:

2k² - (k² + 1) = - (k² + 1)cos(3θ)

Multiply both sides by -1:

(k² + 1) - 2k² = (k² + 1)cos(3θ)

Simplify left side:

1 - k² = (k² + 1)cos(3θ)

So,

cos(3θ) = (1 - k²)/(1 + k²)

Wait, this is the same as what I had earlier. So, that's consistent.

Earlier, I had:

cosθ = (121 - k²)/(121 + k²)

And,

cos(3θ) = (1 - k²)/(1 + k²)

So, using the triple angle formula:

cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ

So, substituting:

(1 - k²)/(1 + k²) = 4[(121 - k²)/(121 + k²)]³ - 3[(121 - k²)/(121 + k²)]

This is the equation I need to solve for k².

Let me denote x = k², so the equation becomes:

(1 - x)/(1 + x) = 4[(121 - x)/(121 + x)]³ - 3[(121 - x)/(121 + x)]

Let me compute the right-hand side (RHS):

Let me denote y = (121 - x)/(121 + x)

Then, RHS = 4y³ - 3y

So, equation is:

(1 - x)/(1 + x) = 4y³ - 3y

But y = (121 - x)/(121 + x)

So, let's compute 4y³ - 3y:

First, compute y:

y = (121 - x)/(121 + x)

Compute y³:

y³ = [(1","[3, '3']",11 \sqrt{5} + 11,"[11, '11']",False

"Alright, so I have this inequality to solve: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, okay. I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the expression x⁴ + 4x² is a quartic polynomial, which can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me try to rewrite it in a way that's easier to handle. Hmm, x⁴ + 4x²... That looks similar to a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x². That might make it easier to work with.

So, if I let y = x², then the expression becomes y² + 4y. So now, the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. Cool, now I have a quadratic inequality in terms of y. Let me split this into two separate inequalities to solve them individually.

First, let's solve the left part: y² + 4y > -4. Then, the right part: y² + 4y < 21. I'll handle each one step by step.

Starting with the left inequality: y² + 4y > -4. Let me bring all terms to one side to make it easier to solve. Subtract -4 from both sides: y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Hmm, that looks like a perfect square. Let me check: (y + 2)² = y² + 4y + 4. Yes, exactly. So, the inequality becomes (y + 2)² > 0.

Now, a square is always non-negative, so (y + 2)² is greater than or equal to 0. But we have it being greater than 0, so when is a square greater than 0? It's when the expression inside isn't zero. So, (y + 2)² > 0 implies that y + 2 ≠ 0, which means y ≠ -2.

But wait, y was defined as x², and x² is always non-negative. So y can't be negative, right? So y ≥ 0. Therefore, y can't be -2 because that's negative. So, for y ≥ 0, (y + 2)² is always positive. So, the left inequality y² + 4y > -4 is always true for all real x because y is non-negative, making (y + 2)² positive. So, the left inequality doesn't restrict the values of x.

Now, moving on to the right inequality: y² + 4y < 21. Again, let's bring all terms to one side: y² + 4y - 21 < 0. Now, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. First, let's find the roots of the equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21. Plugging in, we get y = [-4 ± √(16 + 84)] / 2 = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2.

So, the roots are y = (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3, and y = (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7. So, the quadratic factors as (y - 3)(y + 7) = 0. Therefore, the inequality y² + 4y - 21 < 0 can be written as (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0.

To solve this inequality, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are y = -7 and y = 3. These divide the number line into three intervals: (-∞, -7), (-7, 3), and (3, ∞). I need to test each interval to see where the product is negative.

1. For y < -7, say y = -8: (-8 - 3)(-8 + 7) = (-11)(-1) = 11 > 0.
2. For -7 < y < 3, say y = 0: (0 - 3)(0 + 7) = (-3)(7) = -21 < 0.
3. For y > 3, say y = 4: (4 - 3)(4 + 7) = (1)(11) = 11 > 0.

So, the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 holds when y is between -7 and 3. Therefore, the solution for the right inequality is -7 < y < 3.

But remember, y = x², and x² is always non-negative. So, y ≥ 0. Therefore, combining this with the previous result, the solution for y is 0 ≤ y < 3.

So, y is in [0, 3). Now, translating this back to x, since y = x², we have 0 ≤ x² < 3. Let's solve this for x.

First, x² ≥ 0 is always true, so we don't need to worry about that. Now, x² < 3. Taking square roots on both sides, we get |x| < √3. Which means x is in (-√3, √3).

Therefore, the solution to the original inequality -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21 is all real numbers x such that x is between -√3 and √3.

Wait, let me double-check. The original inequality was -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. We transformed it by substituting y = x², solved the inequalities, and found that y must be between 0 and 3, which translates to x being between -√3 and √3. That seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let me test a value inside the interval and outside to make sure.

Testing x = 0: x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0, which is between -4 and 21. Good.

Testing x = 1: 1 + 4 = 5, which is between -4 and 21. Good.

Testing x = 2: 16 + 16 = 32, which is greater than 21. So, x = 2 is outside the solution, which is correct because 2 > √3 ≈ 1.732.

Testing x = -1: same as x = 1, which is good.

Testing x = √3: x⁴ + 4x² = ( (√3)^4 ) + 4*(√3)^2 = (9) + 4*(3) = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict (<21), so x = √3 is not included, which matches our interval (-√3, √3).

Testing x = -√3: same as x = √3, which is not included.

Testing x = 1.5: x⁴ = (1.5)^4 = 5.0625, 4x² = 4*(2.25) = 9, so total is 14.0625, which is less than 21. Good.

Testing x = 1.732 (approx √3): x⁴ + 4x² ≈ (1.732)^4 + 4*(1.732)^2 ≈ (8.999) + 4*(3) ≈ 8.999 + 12 ≈ 20.999, which is just under 21, so it's included.

Wait, but when x approaches √3, the expression approaches 21, but doesn't reach it. So, the interval is open at √3, which is correct.

Therefore, I think my solution is correct. The values of x that satisfy the inequality are all real numbers between -√3 and √3, not including the endpoints.

So, in interval notation, that's (-√3, √3).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by substituting \(y = x^2\). This transforms the inequality into \(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\).

First, we solve the left part of the inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y > -4 \]
Rewriting it, we get:
\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0 \]
Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, \(y\) cannot be \(-2\). Therefore, this inequality is always true for all real \(x\).

Next, we solve the right part of the inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]
Rewriting it, we get:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]
Solving the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:
\[ y = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = -7 \]
Thus, the inequality factors to:
\[ (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 \]
Using a sign chart, we determine the solution is:
\[ -7 < y < 3 \]
Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, we combine this with the previous result to get:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]
Translating this back to \(x\), we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]
Taking square roots, we get:
\[ |x| < \sqrt{3} \]
Thus, the solution in interval notation is:
\[ (-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}) \]

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) given three equations involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, okay. I remember that in problems involving symmetric equations, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric sums or Vieta's formulas. Let me recall that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are:

- \( S = x + y + z \)
- \( P = xy + yz + zx \)
- \( Q = xyz \)

Given that, I know \( Q = 4 \) from the first equation. So, \( Q = xyz = 4 \).

Now, looking at the second equation, \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \). I remember there's a formula for the sum of cubes in terms of symmetric sums. The formula is:

\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \)

Let me plug in the known values. Let me denote \( S = x + y + z \) and \( P = xy + yz + zx \). Then, the equation becomes:

\( 4 = S^3 - 3SP + 3Q \)

We know \( Q = 4 \), so substituting that in:

\( 4 = S^3 - 3SP + 12 \)

Let me rearrange this:

\( S^3 - 3SP = 4 - 12 \)
\( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \)
\( S^3 - 3SP + 8 = 0 \)

Hmm, so that's one equation involving \( S \) and \( P \). I need another equation to solve for both variables. Let me look at the third equation:

\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor or rearrange it. Let me try to group terms:

\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \)
Similarly, \( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \)
And \( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \)

So, the entire expression can be written as:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \)

Hmm, that's a bit better. Let me factor this further. Notice that \( x + y = S - z \), \( x + z = S - y \), and \( y + z = S - x \). So, substituting these in:

\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) = 12 \)

Let me expand each term:

- \( xy(S - z) = Sxy - xyz \)
- \( xz(S - y) = Sxz - xyz \)
- \( yz(S - x) = Syz - xyz \)

So, adding them all together:

\( Sxy - xyz + Sxz - xyz + Syz - xyz = 12 \)

Combine like terms:

\( S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12 \)

We know \( xy + xz + yz = P \) and \( xyz = Q = 4 \), so substituting:

\( S \cdot P - 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \)
\( SP - 12 = 12 \)
\( SP = 24 \)

So now, from the third equation, we have \( SP = 24 \). Earlier, from the second equation, we had:

\( S^3 - 3SP + 8 = 0 \)

But since \( SP = 24 \), substitute that into the equation:

\( S^3 - 3 \cdot 24 + 8 = 0 \)
\( S^3 - 72 + 8 = 0 \)
\( S^3 - 64 = 0 \)
\( S^3 = 64 \)
\( S = \sqrt[3]{64} \)
\( S = 4 \)

So, \( S = 4 \). Now, since \( SP = 24 \) and \( S = 4 \), we can find \( P \):

\( 4 \cdot P = 24 \)
\( P = 24 / 4 \)
\( P = 6 \)

Therefore, \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \).

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. From the second equation, I used the identity for the sum of cubes and substituted \( Q = 4 \), leading to \( S^3 - 3SP + 8 = 0 \).
2. From the third equation, I manipulated it to get \( SP = 24 \).
3. Substituted \( SP = 24 \) into the second equation's transformed version, solved for \( S \), got \( S = 4 \).
4. Then, using \( SP = 24 \), found \( P = 6 \).

Everything seems to check out. So, I think the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is 6.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is \boxed{6}.

Given the equations:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

We need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \).

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \]

Let \( S = x + y + z \) and \( P = xy + yz + zx \). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ 4 = S^3 - 3SP + 12 \]
Rearranging this, we have:
\[ S^3 - 3SP = -8 \]

Next, we consider the third equation:
\[ xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \]
Using \( x + y = S - z \), \( x + z = S - y \), and \( y + z = S - x \), we get:
\[ xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) = 12 \]
Expanding and combining like terms, we have:
\[ S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12 \]
Substituting \( xy + xz + yz = P \) and \( xyz = 4 \), we get:
\[ SP - 12 = 12 \]
Thus:
\[ SP = 24 \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \)
2. \( SP = 24 \)

Substituting \( SP = 24 \) into the first equation:
\[ S^3 - 72 = -8 \]
\[ S^3 = 64 \]
\[ S = 4 \]

Using \( SP = 24 \) and \( S = 4 \), we find:
\[ 4P = 24 \]
\[ P = 6 \]

Therefore, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a table that shows the percentage of boys and girls in different grades (9th to 12th) from a survey. The total number of students surveyed in each grade is 600, which includes 300 boys and 300 girls. The question is asking which grade has the number of boys that is at least 135% of the number of girls in that grade.

First, I need to understand what 135% means in this context. If I have 135% of the number of girls, that means for every 100 girls, there are 135 boys. So, if there are G girls, the number of boys B should be at least 1.35 * G.

Given that each grade has 600 students, the sum of boys and girls in each grade should be 600. So, for each grade, I can write the equation:

B + G = 600

And we need to find where B >= 1.35 * G.

Let me rearrange the equation to express B in terms of G:

B = 600 - G

Now, substituting this into the inequality:

600 - G >= 1.35 * G

Let me solve for G:

600 >= 1.35G + G  
600 >= 2.35G  
G <= 600 / 2.35  
G <= approximately 255.319

So, G must be less than or equal to approximately 255.319. Since the number of girls must be a whole number, G <= 255.

Therefore, for each grade, I need to check if the percentage of girls is such that the actual number of girls is less than or equal to 255. If that's the case, then the number of boys would be at least 135% of the number of girls.

Now, let's look at each grade one by one.

Starting with the 9th grade:

Percentage of girls is 39.4%. So, the number of girls G is:

G = (39.4 / 100) * 600 = 0.394 * 600 = 236.4

Since 236.4 is less than 255.319, the number of boys would be:

B = 600 - 236.4 = 363.6

Now, let's check if 363.6 is at least 135% of 236.4:

135% of 236.4 = 1.35 * 236.4 ≈ 318.36

Since 363.6 > 318.36, the 9th grade satisfies the condition.

Moving on to the 10th grade:

Percentage of girls is 33.1%. So,

G = (33.1 / 100) * 600 = 0.331 * 600 = 198.6

Number of boys:

B = 600 - 198.6 = 401.4

Check if 401.4 >= 1.35 * 198.6:

1.35 * 198.6 ≈ 268.11

Since 401.4 > 268.11, the 10th grade also satisfies the condition.

Next, the 11th grade:

Percentage of girls is 13.8%. So,

G = (13.8 / 100) * 600 = 0.138 * 600 = 82.8

Number of boys:

B = 600 - 82.8 = 517.2

Check if 517.2 >= 1.35 * 82.8:

1.35 * 82.8 ≈ 111.66

Since 517.2 > 111.66, the 11th grade satisfies the condition as well.

Finally, the 12th grade:

Percentage of girls is 8.6%. So,

G = (8.6 / 100) * 600 = 0.086 * 600 = 51.6

Number of boys:

B = 600 - 51.6 = 548.4

Check if 548.4 >= 1.35 * 51.6:

1.35 * 51.6 ≈ 69.36

Since 548.4 > 69.36, the 12th grade also satisfies the condition.

Wait a minute, all grades satisfy the condition? That seems a bit odd because as the percentage of girls decreases, the number of girls decreases, and thus the number of boys increases, making the condition more easily satisfied. But let me double-check the calculations for each grade to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

For the 9th grade:

G = 39.4% of 600 = 236.4

B = 600 - 236.4 = 363.6

1.35 * 236.4 ≈ 318.36

363.6 > 318.36 → Yes

10th grade:

G = 33.1% of 600 = 198.6

B = 600 - 198.6 = 401.4

1.35 * 198.6 ≈ 268.11

401.4 > 268.11 → Yes

11th grade:

G = 13.8% of 600 = 82.8

B = 600 - 82.8 = 517.2

1.35 * 82.8 ≈ 111.66

517.2 > 111.66 → Yes

12th grade:

G = 8.6% of 600 = 51.6

B = 600 - 51.6 = 548.4

1.35 * 51.6 ≈ 69.36

548.4 > 69.36 → Yes

Hmm, all grades indeed satisfy the condition. But the question is asking for which grade has the number of boys that is at least 135% of the number of girls. Since all grades meet this condition, but perhaps the question expects the grade where this ratio is the highest, or maybe the grade where the percentage of boys is the highest.

Wait, looking back at the table, the percentages for boys are:

9th: 41.1%

10th: 34.4%

11th: 20.6%

12th: 11.6%

So, the 9th grade has the highest percentage of boys, which would mean the highest number of boys relative to girls. Therefore, the 9th grade is the one where the number of boys is the highest, and thus, it's the grade where the number of boys is at least 135% of the number of girls.

But wait, earlier calculations showed that all grades satisfy the condition. So, perhaps the question is expecting the grade where the ratio is just over 135%, or maybe the grade where the ratio is the closest to 135%. Let me check the exact ratios.

For each grade, let's compute B / G and see which one is closest to 1.35.

9th grade:

B = 363.6, G = 236.4

Ratio = 363.6 / 236.4 ≈ 1.538

10th grade:

B = 401.4, G = 198.6

Ratio = 401.4 / 198.6 ≈ 2.022

11th grade:

B = 517.2, G = 82.8

Ratio = 517.2 / 82.8 ≈ 6.25

12th grade:

B = 548.4, G = 51.6

Ratio = 548.4 / 51.6 ≈ 10.64

So, the ratios are:

9th: ~1.538

10th: ~2.022

11th: ~6.25

12th: ~10.64

The question is asking for where B is at least 135% of G, which is a ratio of 1.35. All grades have a ratio higher than 1.35, so technically, all grades satisfy the condition. However, if the question is looking for the grade where the ratio is just over 1.35, then the 9th grade is the closest, with a ratio of approximately 1.538.

Alternatively, if the question is looking for the grade where the ratio is the highest, then the 12th grade has the highest ratio, but it's way above 1.35.

But since all grades satisfy the condition, perhaps the answer is all of them. However, the way the question is phrased, ""which grade,"" suggests that there might be one specific grade. Maybe I misinterpreted the question.

Wait, let me read the question again: ""ਕਿਹੜੀ ਜਮਾਤ ਲਈ ਇਸ ਦੇ ਮੁੰਡਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਗਿਣਤੀ ਇਸ ਦੀਆਂ ਕੁੜੀਆਂ ਦੀ ਗਿਣਤੀ ਦੇ 135% ਦੇ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਨੇੜੇ ਹੈ?"" which translates to ""Which grade has the number of boys equal to at least 135% of the number of girls?""

So, it's asking for the grade where the number of boys is at least 135% of the number of girls. Since all grades satisfy this, but perhaps the question expects the grade where this ratio is the highest, which would be the 9th grade with the highest percentage of boys.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the grade where the percentage of boys is at least 135% of the percentage of girls. But that would be a different calculation.

Wait, let me check the original table again. The table gives the percentage of boys and girls in each grade. So, for example, in the 9th grade, 41.1% are boys and 58.9% are girls (since 100% - 41.1% = 58.9%). Similarly, for the 10th grade, 34.4% boys and 65.6% girls, and so on.

If the question is asking whether the percentage of boys is at least 135% of the percentage of girls, that would be a different calculation. Let's explore that possibility.

So, for each grade, we can calculate (Percentage of boys) / (Percentage of girls) and see if it's at least 1.35.

Let's compute that:

9th grade:

41.1 / 58.9 ≈ 0.700

10th grade:

34.4 / 65.6 ≈ 0.524

11th grade:

20.6 / 81.1 ≈ 0.254

12th grade:

11.6 / 91.4 ≈ 0.127

None of these are above 1.35. So, that interpretation doesn't make sense.

Therefore, the initial interpretation is correct: the number of boys is at least 135% of the number of girls in the grade. Since all grades satisfy this, but the question is asking ""which grade,"" perhaps it's expecting the grade where this ratio is the highest, which is the 9th grade.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the grade where the percentage of boys is at least 135% of the percentage of girls, but as we saw, none of them satisfy that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the grade where the percentage of boys is at least 135% of the percentage of girls, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again:

""ਬੱਸ ਸਵਾਰੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਸ਼ਤ ਦਰਸਾਇਆ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ; ਹਰ ਜਮਾਤ ਵਿੱਚ 300 ਮੁੰਡੇ ਅਤੇ 300 ਕੁੜੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਸਰਵੇਖਣ ਕੀਤਾ ਗਿਆ। ਕਿਹੜੀ ਜਮਾਤ ਲਈ ਇਸ ਦੇ ਮੁੰਡਿਆਂ ਦੀ ਗਿਣਤੀ ਇਸ ਦੀਆਂ ਕੁੜੀਆਂ ਦੀ ਗਿਣਤੀ ਦੇ 135% ਦੇ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਨੇੜੇ ਹੈ?""

So, it's clear that it's about the number of boys being at least 135% of the number of girls in the grade. Since all grades satisfy this, but the question is in the context of a table, perhaps it's expecting the grade where this ratio is the highest, which is the 9th grade.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the grade where the percentage of boys is at least 135% of the percentage of girls, but as we saw, that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the grade where the number","[135*(1/100), '135']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving fractions, I need to consider the numerator and the denominator separately because the sign of the whole expression depends on both.

First, let me look at the numerator: \(|x^2 - 81|\). Since it's an absolute value, it's always non-negative, right? So, \(|x^2 - 81| \geq 0\) for all real numbers x. That means the numerator can never be negative. It can be zero or positive.

Now, the denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\). I should factor that to make it easier to analyze. Let me factor out an x: \(x(x - 36)\). So, the denominator is zero when x is 0 or 36. That means the expression is undefined at x = 0 and x = 36 because division by zero isn't allowed. So, I have to exclude these points from the solution set.

Since the inequality is less than zero, the entire fraction has to be negative. But the numerator is always non-negative, so for the fraction to be negative, the denominator must be negative. Because a positive divided by a negative is negative. So, I need to find where the denominator is negative.

So, let's solve \(x^2 - 36x < 0\). Factoring it, we have \(x(x - 36) < 0\). To find where this product is negative, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are at x = 0 and x = 36.

Let me test intervals around these points:

1. When x < 0: Let's pick x = -1. Then, (-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37, which is positive.
2. When 0 < x < 36: Let's pick x = 1. Then, (1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35, which is negative.
3. When x > 36: Let's pick x = 37. Then, (37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37, which is positive.

So, the denominator is negative only when x is between 0 and 36. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative only when the denominator is negative, which is in the interval (0, 36).

But wait, I should also consider where the numerator is zero because if the numerator is zero, the whole expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality (since it's strictly less than zero). So, when is \(|x^2 - 81| = 0\)? That happens when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), so x = 9 or x = -9.

So, at x = 9 and x = -9, the expression equals zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. Therefore, these points should be excluded from the solution.

Putting it all together, the expression is negative when the denominator is negative, which is between 0 and 36, but we have to exclude x = 9 and x = -9. However, x = -9 is not in the interval (0, 36), so we only need to exclude x = 9 from the interval (0, 36).

Therefore, the solution set is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 9. So, in interval notation, that would be (0, 9) union (9, 36).

Wait, but hold on a second. I should also check if the numerator is zero anywhere else. We already saw that it's zero at x = 9 and x = -9. So, only x = 9 is within the interval where the denominator is negative. So, excluding x = 9 is correct.

Let me just double-check if there are any other points where the numerator is zero or the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero at x = 9 and x = -9, and the denominator is zero at x = 0 and x = 36. So, we've accounted for all critical points.

Therefore, the solution is all x such that 0 < x < 36, excluding x = 9. So, in interval notation, that's (0, 9) ∪ (9, 36).

I think that's it. Let me just write it out clearly.

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we start by analyzing the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative. Therefore, the numerator can never be negative.
2. The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which factors to \(x(x - 36)\). This expression is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), making the expression undefined at these points.

Since the inequality is less than zero, the fraction must be negative. This happens when the denominator is negative because the numerator is non-negative. We solve \(x^2 - 36x < 0\) by factoring it as \(x(x - 36) < 0\).

Using a sign chart, we find that the denominator is negative in the interval \(0 < x < 36\).

Next, we consider where the numerator is zero, which occurs at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = 9\) is within the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we exclude it from the solution.

Thus, the solution is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 9. In interval notation, this is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

"Okay, so I have this triangle RST, and I'm supposed to find sin T. They told me that sin R is 2/5. Hmm, let me try to visualize this triangle first. The Asymptote code shows that point T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, it's a right-angled triangle at point S, right? Because the right angle is marked at S. Wait, no, hold on. The right angle is marked at S, so that means angle S is 90 degrees. So, triangle RST is a right-angled triangle at S.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, they drew R connected to S, S connected to T, and T connected back to R. So, the triangle is RST with right angle at S. So, sides: RS, ST, and RT. Let me label the sides. Since it's a right-angled triangle at S, the sides opposite to the angles will be as follows: side opposite angle R is ST, side opposite angle T is RS, and the hypotenuse is RT.

They gave me sin R = 2/5. So, sin R is opposite over hypotenuse. In triangle RST, angle R is at point R, so the side opposite to angle R is ST. So, sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST / RT = 2/5. So, ST = 2k and RT = 5k for some k.

But wait, let me think. If the triangle is right-angled at S, then sides RS and ST are the legs, and RT is the hypotenuse. So, angle R is at point R, so the sides relative to angle R: opposite side is ST, adjacent side is RS, and hypotenuse is RT.

So, sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST / RT = 2/5. So, ST = 2k, RT = 5k. Then, by Pythagoras, RS^2 + ST^2 = RT^2. So, RS^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2. That is, RS^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2. So, RS^2 = 25k^2 - 4k^2 = 21k^2. Therefore, RS = sqrt(21)k.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, point R is at (2, sqrt(21)), and point S is at (2,0), so the length RS is sqrt( (2-2)^2 + (sqrt(21)-0)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + 21) = sqrt(21). So, RS is sqrt(21). So, in our earlier notation, RS = sqrt(21)k. Therefore, sqrt(21)k = sqrt(21), so k = 1. Therefore, ST = 2k = 2, and RT = 5k = 5.

So, the sides are RS = sqrt(21), ST = 2, RT = 5. So, now, we need to find sin T. Angle T is at point T, which is at (0,0). So, in triangle RST, angle T is at point T, so the sides relative to angle T: opposite side is RS, adjacent side is ST, and hypotenuse is RT.

So, sin T = opposite/hypotenuse = RS / RT. RS is sqrt(21), RT is 5. So, sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Wait, let me double-check. In triangle RST, angle T is at (0,0). The sides: opposite to angle T is RS, which is sqrt(21), and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. So, yes, sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, since we know all the sides, we can use the sides to compute sin T. So, in triangle RST, angle T is opposite side RS, which is sqrt(21), and hypotenuse RT is 5. So, sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that in a right-angled triangle, the sine of one acute angle is the cosine of the other. Since angle R and angle T are the other two angles, and they add up to 90 degrees. So, sin R = cos T. Wait, but sin R is 2/5, so cos T is 2/5. Then, since sin^2 T + cos^2 T = 1, sin^2 T = 1 - (2/5)^2 = 1 - 4/25 = 21/25. Therefore, sin T = sqrt(21)/5. So, same result.

So, either way, sin T is sqrt(21)/5.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\sin{T}$ is \boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}.
</think>

Given triangle \( \triangle RST \) with a right angle at \( S \), we know that \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \). We need to find \( \sin{T} \).

1. Since \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \), we recognize that this is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in the right-angled triangle. Therefore, the side opposite to angle \( R \) (which is \( ST \)) is \( 2k \) and the hypotenuse \( RT \) is \( 5k \) for some constant \( k \).

2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find the adjacent side \( RS \):
   \[
   RS^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2
   \]
   \[
   RS^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2
   \]
   \[
   RS^2 = 21k^2
   \]
   \[
   RS = \sqrt{21}k
   \]

3. Given the coordinates from the Asymptote code, we determine that \( RS = \sqrt{21} \). Thus, \( \sqrt{21}k = \sqrt{21} \) implies \( k = 1 \). Therefore, \( ST = 2 \) and \( RT = 5 \).

4. To find \( \sin{T} \), we note that angle \( T \) is opposite side \( RS \) and the hypotenuse is \( RT \). Thus,
   \[
   \sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
   \]

5. Alternatively, using the identity \( \sin^2{T} + \cos^2{T} = 1 \) and knowing \( \cos{T} = \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \), we find:
   \[
   \sin^2{T} = 1 - \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{4}{25} = \frac{21}{25}
   \]
   \[
   \sin{T} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
   \]

Thus, the value of \( \sin{T} \) is \boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}.","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum distance from the origin (0,0) to the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). The answer should be in the form √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a isn't divisible by any perfect square. Then, I have to find a + b. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin is given by the distance formula, which is √(x² + y²). Since I want the minimum distance, I can set up a function for the distance squared, which is easier to work with because the square root can complicate things. So, let me define D² = x² + y². This should have its minimum at the same point as the distance itself.

Given the equation of the graph, y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), I can substitute this into the distance squared formula. So, substituting y, we get:

D² = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²

Let me compute that step by step. First, square the y term:

[(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)²

So, expanding (x² - 3)², that's x⁴ - 6x² + 9. Therefore, the squared term becomes (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9).

Now, plugging that back into D²:

D² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9)

Let me distribute the 1/2:

D² = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + (9/2)

Combine like terms:

x² - 3x² is -2x², so:

D² = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + (9/2)

Now, to find the minimum distance, I need to find the minimum value of D² with respect to x. Since D² is a function of x, let's call it f(x):

f(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + (9/2)

To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then, check if it's a minimum using the second derivative or some other method.

So, let's compute f'(x):

f'(x) = d/dx [ (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + (9/2) ]

The derivative of (1/2)x⁴ is 2x³, the derivative of -2x² is -4x, and the derivative of a constant (9/2) is 0. So:

f'(x) = 2x³ - 4x

Set this equal to zero to find critical points:

2x³ - 4x = 0

Factor out 2x:

2x(x² - 2) = 0

So, the critical points are x = 0 and x² - 2 = 0, which gives x = ±√2.

Now, I need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimum value. Let's evaluate f(x) at these points.

First, at x = 0:

f(0) = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + (9/2) = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2

Next, at x = √2:

f(√2) = (1/2)(√2)^4 - 2(√2)^2 + (9/2)

Compute each term:

(√2)^4 = ( (√2)^2 )^2 = (2)^2 = 4

So, (1/2)(4) = 2

Then, (√2)^2 = 2, so -2*(2) = -4

So, f(√2) = 2 - 4 + 9/2

Convert to common denominator:

2 is 4/2, -4 is -8/2, so:

4/2 - 8/2 + 9/2 = (4 - 8 + 9)/2 = 5/2

Similarly, at x = -√2, since the function is even (only even powers of x), f(-√2) will be the same as f(√2), which is 5/2.

So, comparing f(0) = 9/2 and f(√2) = 5/2, clearly 5/2 is smaller. Therefore, the minimum distance squared is 5/2, so the minimum distance is √(5/2).

But the problem states that the answer should be in the form √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is not divisible by any perfect square. Let me see if √(5/2) can be expressed in that form.

√(5/2) can be written as √5 / √2. But √2 is irrational, so to rationalize the denominator, we can multiply numerator and denominator by √2:

√5 / √2 = (√5 * √2) / (√2 * √2) = √10 / 2

So, √10 / 2 is the same as √(5/2), but written with a rational denominator. Now, √10 is already simplified because 10 factors into 2 and 5, neither of which is a perfect square. So, a = 10 and b = 2.

Therefore, a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I started by writing the distance squared as x² + y², substituted y from the given equation, expanded, and simplified to f(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2. That seems correct.

2. Took the derivative f'(x) = 2x³ - 4x, set it to zero, factored out 2x, got critical points at x=0 and x=±√2. That seems right.

3. Evaluated f(x) at x=0 and x=√2. At x=0, f(0)=9/2. At x=√2, f(√2)=2 - 4 + 9/2 = 5/2. Correct.

4. Converted √(5/2) to √10 / 2, so a=10, b=2, a+b=12. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me just confirm the substitution step again. When I substituted y into the distance squared, I had:

D² = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²

Which is x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)^2. Then expanding (x² - 3)^2 gives x⁴ -6x² +9, so (1/2)(x⁴ -6x² +9) is (1/2)x⁴ -3x² + 9/2. Then adding x² gives (1/2)x⁴ -2x² +9/2. That seems correct.

Then derivative is 2x³ -4x, set to zero, gives x=0 and x=±√2. Correct.

Evaluating f(0)=9/2, f(√2)= (1/2)(4) -2*(2) +9/2= 2 -4 +4.5= 2.5=5/2. Correct.

So, the minimum distance squared is 5/2, so distance is √(5/2)=√10 /2. So, a=10, b=2, a+b=12.

I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.

**Final Answer**
The value of $a + b$ is \boxed{12}.
</think>

To find the minimum distance from the origin (0,0) to the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance squared from a point \((x, y)\) to the origin, which is given by \( D^2 = x^2 + y^2 \).

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:
\[
D^2 = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2
\]
Simplifying the squared term:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2
\]
Expanding \((x^2 - 3)^2\):
\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]
Thus, the distance squared becomes:
\[
D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)
\]
Distributing the \(\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
To find the minimum distance, we take the derivative of \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \) and set it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]
Factoring out \(2x\):
\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
This gives the critical points \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \).

Evaluating \( f(x) \) at these points:
- At \( x = 0 \):
  \[
  f(0) = \frac{9}{2}
  \]
- At \( x = \sqrt{2} \):
  \[
  f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
  \]

The minimum distance squared is \(\frac{5}{2}\), so the minimum distance is \(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}\). Rationalizing the denominator, we get:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]
Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \), giving \( a + b = 12 \).

The value of \( a + b \) is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"Alright, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's 3 - x when x is less than or equal to 3, and it's -x³ + 2x² + 3x when x is greater than 3. I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, okay, so first, I think I need to find the values of x such that f(x) equals 0 and f(x) equals 6, and then add those x values together. That makes sense because f inverse of a value is the x that gives that value when plugged into f.

Let me start with f inverse of 0. So, I need to solve f(x) = 0. Since f is piecewise, I should check both pieces.

First, for x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x. So, set that equal to 0: 3 - x = 0. Solving for x, I get x = 3. Now, since x = 3 is the boundary point, it's included in the first piece, so that's valid. So, f inverse of 0 is 3.

Next, I need to find f inverse of 6. So, f(x) = 6. Again, I have to check both pieces.

First, check the x ≤ 3 piece: 3 - x = 6. Solving that, 3 - x = 6 => -x = 3 => x = -3. Now, x = -3 is less than 3, so that's valid. But wait, I should also check the other piece in case there's another solution. So, for x > 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let me set that equal to 6 and see if there's a solution.

So, -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. Let's rearrange that: -x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0. Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.

Using the Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. Let me test x=1: -1 + 2 + 3 -6 = (-1 + 2) + (3 -6) = 1 - 3 = -2 ≠ 0. x=2: -8 + 8 + 6 -6 = (-8 +8) + (6 -6) = 0 + 0 = 0. Oh, so x=2 is a root. So, (x - 2) is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out. Let's divide -x³ + 2x² + 3x -6 by (x - 2). Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: -1, 2, 3, -6

Bring down -1. Multiply by 2: -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0. Multiply by 2: 0. Add to next coefficient: 3 + 0 = 3. Multiply by 2: 6. Add to last coefficient: -6 +6 = 0. So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(-x² + 0x + 3) = (x - 2)(-x² + 3). So, set equal to zero: (x - 2)(-x² + 3) = 0. So, x = 2 or -x² + 3 = 0 => x² = 3 => x = sqrt(3) or x = -sqrt(3).

But wait, in the piece where x > 3, so x must be greater than 3. So, x=2 is less than 3, so it's not in this piece. x = sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, which is also less than 3. x = -sqrt(3) is negative, which is also less than 3. So, none of these roots are in the x > 3 region. Therefore, the only solution for f(x) = 6 is x = -3.

Wait, but hold on, when I solved the first piece, x ≤ 3, I got x = -3, which is valid. But when I solved the second piece, x > 3, I didn't get any solutions because all the roots were less than 3. So, f inverse of 6 is -3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the cubic equation. Let me plug x=3 into the second piece: f(3) = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0. So, at x=3, the function is 0, which is consistent with the first piece. Now, for x > 3, let's see what happens at x=4: f(4) = -64 + 32 + 12 = (-64 + 32) + 12 = (-32) + 12 = -20. So, f(4) = -20. At x=5: f(5) = -125 + 50 + 15 = (-125 + 50) +15 = (-75) +15 = -60. So, it's decreasing as x increases beyond 3. So, the function is decreasing for x > 3, starting from 0 at x=3 and going to negative infinity as x increases. So, f(x) for x > 3 is always less than or equal to 0. Therefore, f(x) = 6 can't be achieved in the x > 3 region because it's only negative there. So, the only solution is x = -3.

Therefore, f inverse of 6 is -3.

So, f inverse of 0 is 3, and f inverse of 6 is -3. Adding them together: 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.

For f inverse of 0: x ≤ 3, 3 - x = 0 => x=3. That's correct.

For f inverse of 6: x ≤ 3, 3 - x = 6 => x = -3. That's correct. And in the x > 3 region, f(x) is negative, so no solution there. So, yes, f inverse of 6 is -3.

So, 3 + (-3) = 0. So, the answer is 0.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that f(x) = 6 could have another solution in the x > 3 region? Because sometimes cubics can have multiple real roots. Let me check the cubic equation again: -x³ + 2x² + 3x -6 = 0. We found x=2 is a root, but when we factor it, we get (x - 2)(-x² + 3) = 0. So, the other roots are x = sqrt(3) and x = -sqrt(3). But as I said, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, which is less than 3, so it's not in the x > 3 region. So, no, there are no other roots in x > 3. So, f inverse of 6 is indeed -3.

Therefore, adding them together: 3 + (-3) = 0.

I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 0.

2. **Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \), solve \( 3 - x = 6 \):
     \[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
   - Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), we check the other piece for \( x > 3 \):
     - Solve \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \):
       \[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
       - Using the Rational Root Theorem, we find \( x = 2 \) is a root. Factoring out \( (x - 2) \) gives:
         \[ (x - 2)(-x^2 + 3) = 0. \]
       - The roots are \( x = 2 \), \( x = \sqrt{3} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{3} \), all of which are less than 3. Thus, no solutions in \( x > 3 \).
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding the results:
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

"Alright, so I have this problem here about a regular octahedron with points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and P. The problem says that from point P, the distances to five of the octahedron's vertices are given: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex, which is labeled as Q, I think. Wait, actually, looking back, the Asymptote code labels the points A, B, C, D, E, F, and P. So, the six points are A, B, C, D, E, F, and P. But in a regular octahedron, there are only six vertices, right? So, maybe P is one of the vertices? Wait, no, because in the Asymptote code, P is a separate point, so maybe it's an external point from which we're measuring distances to the vertices.

Wait, hold on. Let me parse this again. The problem says: ""ਇੱਕ ਨਿਯਮਤ ਅਸ਼ਟਫਲਕ ਦੇ ਪੰਜ ਕੋਣਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਬਿੰਦੂ P ਤੱਕ ਦੇ ਫਾਸਲੇ 3, 7, 8, 9, ਅਤੇ 11 ਹਨ। P ਤੋਂ ਛੇਵੇਂ ਕੋਣ ਤੱਕ ਦਾ ਫਾਸਲਾ ਲੱਭੋ.""

So, translating that, it's saying that from point P, the distances to five of the octahedron's vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex.

First, I need to recall what a regular octahedron is. A regular octahedron is a Platonic solid with eight triangular faces, six vertices, and twelve edges. It can be thought of as two square pyramids glued together at their square bases. Each vertex is equidistant from the center.

In the Asymptote code provided, the points A, B, C, D, E, F are defined as the six vertices of the octahedron. Specifically, A is (1,0,0), B is (-1,0,0), C is (0,1,0), D is (0,-1,0), E is (0,0,1), and F is (0,0,-1). So, these are the standard coordinates for a regular octahedron centered at the origin with vertices along the axes.

Point P is given as (1.2, 1.5, 1). So, it's an external point somewhere in space. The distances from P to five of the octahedron's vertices are given, and we need to find the distance to the sixth.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, P is drawn as a separate point connected to each of the six vertices, so actually, P is connected to all six vertices, meaning it's an external point with six lines connecting to each vertex. But the problem mentions five of the octahedron's vertices, so maybe one of the vertices is not being considered? Or perhaps P is connected to all six, but the problem only gives five distances.

Wait, the problem says: ""ਇੱਕ ਨਿਯਮਤ ਅਸ਼ਟਫਲਕ ਦੇ ਪੰਜ ਕੋਣਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਬਿੰਦੂ P ਤੱਕ ਦੇ ਫਾਸਲੇ 3, 7, 8, 9, ਅਤੇ 11 ਹਨ."" So, it's five vertices, not six. So, one vertex is missing. So, we have to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex.

But in the Asymptote code, P is connected to all six vertices, so maybe all six distances are given, but the problem only mentions five. Hmm, perhaps the problem is misstated, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me check the Asymptote code again. It defines points A, B, C, D, E, F, and P. Then it draws lines from A to P, B to P, etc., all in red. So, P is connected to all six vertices. So, the problem must be that from P, the distances to five of the six vertices are given, and we need to find the sixth.

So, the given distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. So, five distances, and we need to find the sixth.

Now, in a regular octahedron, the vertices are symmetric with respect to the center. So, perhaps there's a relationship between the distances from an external point to the vertices.

Wait, I recall that in a regular octahedron, the vertices can be considered as points in 3D space with coordinates (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1). So, the distance from P to each vertex can be calculated using the distance formula.

Given that, maybe we can set up equations based on the distances and solve for the unknown distance.

Let me denote the coordinates of P as (x, y, z). Then, the distance from P to each vertex is given by the square root of (x ± 1)^2 + (y ± 0)^2 + (z ± 0)^2, etc., depending on the vertex.

Wait, let's list the vertices:

A: (1, 0, 0)

B: (-1, 0, 0)

C: (0, 1, 0)

D: (0, -1, 0)

E: (0, 0, 1)

F: (0, 0, -1)

So, the distances from P = (x, y, z) to each vertex are:

PA: sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2]

PB: sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2]

PC: sqrt[x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2]

PD: sqrt[x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2]

PE: sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2]

PF: sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2]

Given that, the problem states that five of these distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, and we need to find the sixth.

But without knowing which distances correspond to which vertices, it's a bit tricky. However, perhaps we can use the fact that the product of the distances from P to opposite vertices is equal? Wait, is that a property of regular octahedrons?

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps we can square the distances to eliminate the square roots and set up equations.

Let me denote the squared distances as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, corresponding to the distances to A, B, C, D, E, F.

Given that, we have:

PA^2 = (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = d1

PB^2 = (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = d2

PC^2 = x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = d3

PD^2 = x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = d4

PE^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = d5

PF^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2 = d6

Now, if we subtract PA^2 from PB^2, we get:

PB^2 - PA^2 = [(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2] = [x^2 + 2x + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1)] = 4x

Similarly, PC^2 - PD^2 = [x^2 + (y - 1)^2 - x^2 - (y + 1)^2] = [y^2 - 2y + 1 - y^2 - 2y - 1] = -4y

Similarly, PE^2 - PF^2 = [x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 - x^2 - y^2 - (z + 1)^2] = [z^2 - 2z + 1 - z^2 - 2z - 1] = -4z

So, from these differences, we can find x, y, z in terms of the squared distances.

Specifically:

4x = PB^2 - PA^2 => x = (PB^2 - PA^2)/4

-4y = PC^2 - PD^2 => y = (PD^2 - PC^2)/4

-4z = PE^2 - PF^2 => z = (PF^2 - PE^2)/4

So, if we can figure out which distances correspond to which vertices, we can compute x, y, z, and then compute the remaining distance.

But the problem is that we don't know which of the given distances (3,7,8,9,11) correspond to which vertices. So, we have to consider different possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any external point to the vertices is constant, plus some multiple of the distance from the point to the center.

Wait, let me recall that formula. For a regular polyhedron, there is a relation involving the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices.

In general, for a regular polyhedron centered at the origin, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point P to the vertices is equal to 6 times the square of the distance from P to the center plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices.

But in this case, the octahedron is centered at the origin, and the distance from the center to each vertex is 1, since the vertices are at (±1, 0, 0), etc.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex is equal to 6*(OP)^2 + 6*(1)^2, where OP is the distance from P to the center.

Wait, let me verify that.

Wait, more accurately, for any point P, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex V_i is equal to 6*(OP)^2 + sum_{i=1}^6 |OV_i|^2.

Since each |OV_i|^2 is 1, because each vertex is at distance 1 from the center, the sum is 6*(OP)^2 + 6*1 = 6*(OP^2 + 1).

But OP^2 is x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

So, sum of squared distances = 6*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1).

But we can also compute the sum of the given squared distances and the unknown squared distance, and set it equal to 6*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1).

Wait, but we have five squared distances given, and we need to find the sixth. Let me denote the given squared distances as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and the unknown as d6.

So, sum = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 6*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1)

But we can also express x^2 + y^2 + z^2 in terms of the squared distances.

From earlier, we have:

x = (PB^2 - PA^2)/4

y = (PD^2 - PC^2)/4

z = (PF^2 - PE^2)/4

So, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = [(PB^2 - PA^2)/4]^2 + [(PD^2 - PC^2)/4]^2 + [(PF^2 - PE^2)/4]^2

Therefore, sum of squared distances = 6*( [ (PB^2 - PA^2)^2 + (PD^2 - PC^2)^2 + (PF^2 - PE^2)^2 ] / 16 + 1 )

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the product of the distances from P to opposite vertices is equal. Wait, is that true?

Wait, in a regular octahedron, opposite vertices are separated by a certain distance. For example, A and B are opposite, C and D are opposite, E and F are opposite.

Wait, actually, in the standard octahedron, A is (1,0,0), B is (-1,0,0), so they are opposite. Similarly, C and D are opposite, E and F are opposite.

So, perhaps the product PA * PB, PC * PD, PE * PF are equal?

Wait, let me test this.

PA * PB = sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] * sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2]

= sqrt{ [(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2][(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] }

= sqrt{ [ (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2)(x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) ] }

= sqrt{ [ ( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1)^2 - (2x)^2 ) ] }

= sqrt{ ( (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1)^2 - 4x^2 ) }

Similarly, PC * PD = sqrt{ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1)^2 - 4y^2 }

And PE * PF = sqrt{ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1)^2 - 4z^2 }

So, unless x, y, z are zero, these products are different. So, maybe that's not the property we need","[4, '4']",\sqrt{66},[],False

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a physics problem here about the relationship between weight, mass, and velocity. The question is about finding the ratio of the velocities of two balls, Jey's baseball and Jeyan's softball, given their masses. 

First, I need to recall the basic physics principles involved. The problem mentions that the force (or ""bal"") is equal to mass times velocity. So, the formula would be F = m * v, where F is the force, m is the mass, and v is the velocity. 

Wait, but hold on. The problem says that the force is equal to mass multiplied by velocity. That seems a bit off because, in physics, force is actually mass multiplied by acceleration (F = m * a). But maybe in this context, they're simplifying it or using a different definition. I'll go with what's given: F = m * v.

So, for both balls, the force is the same because the problem states that the ""bal"" is the same. That means F_baseball = F_softball. 

Given that, we can set up the equation: m_baseball * v_baseball = m_softball * v_softball.

We need to find the ratio of the velocities, specifically v_softball to v_baseball, I think. The problem says to return the ratio in the simplest form, so probably v_softball : v_baseball.

Let me plug in the numbers. The mass of the baseball is 200 grams, and the mass of the softball is 150 grams. So,

200g * v_baseball = 150g * v_softball

I can rearrange this to solve for the ratio. Let's divide both sides by 200g * v_softball:

(200g * v_baseball) / (200g * v_softball) = (150g * v_softball) / (200g * v_softball)

Simplifying, the 200g cancels out on the left, and on the right, 150g / 200g simplifies to 3/4. So,

v_baseball / v_softball = 3/4

But we need the ratio of v_softball to v_baseball, which is the reciprocal. So,

v_softball / v_baseball = 4/3

Therefore, the ratio is 4:3.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the force is the same, and mass is higher for the baseball, then velocity should be lower, right? Because F = m * v. So, if m is higher, v should be lower to keep F the same. So, the softball, being lighter, should have a higher velocity. So, the ratio of softball velocity to baseball velocity is indeed higher, which is 4:3. That makes sense.

I think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer should be 4:3.
</think>

The ratio of the velocities of Jeyan's softball to Jey's baseball is determined by the inverse ratio of their masses since the force (bal) is constant. 

Given:
- Mass of baseball (m_baseball) = 200 g
- Mass of softball (m_softball) = 150 g

Using the formula F = m * v, and since F is the same for both:
m_baseball * v_baseball = m_softball * v_softball

Rearranging for the velocity ratio:
v_softball / v_baseball = m_baseball / m_softball = 200 / 150 = 4/3

Thus, the ratio is 4:3.

Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find how many common digits are there between the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number 629. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that to convert a decimal number to another base, I can use the division-remainder method. So, I'll start by converting 629 into base 7 and base 8 separately.

Let me begin with base 7. I need to divide 629 by 7 repeatedly and keep track of the remainders.

629 divided by 7 is 89 with a remainder of 6. So, the least significant digit is 6.

Now, take 89 and divide by 7. 89 divided by 7 is 12 with a remainder of 5. So, the next digit is 5.

Next, 12 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 5. So, another 5.

Then, 1 divided by 7 is 0 with a remainder of 1. So, the most significant digit is 1.

Putting it all together, the base 7 representation of 629 is 1 5 5 6, or 1556 in base 7.

Okay, now moving on to base 8. Let's do the same process.

629 divided by 8 is 78 with a remainder of 5. So, the least significant digit is 5.

78 divided by 8 is 9 with a remainder of 6. So, next digit is 6.

9 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 1. So, another 1.

1 divided by 8 is 0 with a remainder of 1. So, the most significant digit is 1.

Putting it all together, the base 8 representation of 629 is 1 1 6 5, or 1165 in base 8.

Now, I need to compare the digits of both base 7 and base 8 representations to find any common digits.

Base 7 digits: 1, 5, 5, 6.

Base 8 digits: 1, 1, 6, 5.

Looking at these, the digits present in both are 1, 5, and 6. So, there are three common digits.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. In base 7, the digits are 1, 5, 5, 6, and in base 8, they are 1, 1, 6, 5. Yes, 1, 5, and 6 are all present in both. So, that's three digits.

I think that's it. So, the number of common digits is 3.
</think>

The decimal number \(629_{10}\) is converted to base 7 and base 8 as follows:

- **Base 7**: \(1556_7\)
- **Base 8**: \(1165_8\)

Comparing the digits of both representations, the common digits are 1, 5, and 6.

"Alright, let's try to figure out how many handshakes happen in this scenario. So, we have seven gnomes and ten goblins. Each gnome is going to shake hands with every goblin, but not with other gnomes. Also, the goblins don't shake hands with other goblins or the gnomes. 

First, I need to understand who is shaking hands with whom. The problem says that gnomes shake hands with each other, but not with other gnomes. Wait, no, actually, it says that gnomes have handshakes with each other, but goblins don't shake hands with gnomes or other goblins. So, each gnome will shake hands with every other gnome, but not with the goblins. 

So, the total number of handshakes would be the number of handshakes among the gnomes plus the number of handshakes among the goblins. But wait, the problem says that goblins don't shake hands with other goblins, so there are zero handshakes among goblins. 

Therefore, the total handshakes are just the handshakes among the gnomes. To calculate that, we can use the formula for combinations since each handshake is a unique pair. The formula for combinations is n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of people. 

Here, n is 7 (the number of gnomes). So, plugging in the numbers: 7*6/2 = 21. 

So, there are 21 handshakes in total.

"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial g(x), which is equal to f(x-1). The given polynomial f(x) is 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you substitute x-1 into a polynomial, you're essentially shifting the graph of the polynomial to the right by 1 unit. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here. What I need is the polynomial g(x) = f(x-1), and then I have to find the sum of its coefficients.

Wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x=1. Is that right? Let me verify. If I have a polynomial like g(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0, then the sum of the coefficients is a_n + ... + a_1 + a_0, which is exactly g(1). So yes, evaluating g at x=1 gives the sum of its coefficients. That seems like a useful shortcut.

So, instead of expanding f(x-1) and then plugging in x=1, I can just compute g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). Wait, is that correct? Let me see. If g(x) = f(x-1), then g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). So, f(0) is the sum of the coefficients of g(x). That's a much simpler approach!

Let me compute f(0). The polynomial f(x) is 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Plugging in x=0, all the terms with x will become zero. So, f(0) = 3*(0)^4 + 5*(0)^2 - 9*(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2. So, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think again. If I were to expand f(x-1), would the sum of the coefficients still be f(0)? Because when I substitute x=1 into g(x), which is f(x-1), it becomes f(1-1) = f(0). So, yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if I were to expand f(x-1), I would have to compute each term:

f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2.

But expanding all that might take some time, and since I already know that the sum of coefficients is f(0), which is -2, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me try expanding f(x-1) and then sum the coefficients to see if I get the same result.

First, let's expand (x-1)^4. I remember that (a - b)^4 = a^4 - 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 - 4ab^3 + b^4. So, substituting a = x and b = 1, we get:

(x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1.

Then, 3(x-1)^4 = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3.

Next, expand (x-1)^2. That's x^2 - 2x + 1. So, 5(x-1)^2 = 5x^2 - 10x + 5.

Then, -9(x-1) = -9x + 9.

And the constant term is -2.

Now, let's combine all these:

3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3
+ 5x^2 - 10x + 5
- 9x + 9
- 2
---------------------------
Combine like terms:

- x^4 term: 3x^4
- x^3 term: -12x^3
- x^2 terms: 18x^2 + 5x^2 = 23x^2
- x terms: -12x -10x -9x = -31x
- constants: 3 + 5 + 9 - 2 = 15

So, g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15.

Now, let's find the sum of the coefficients: 3 + (-12) + 23 + (-31) + 15.

Calculating step by step:

3 - 12 = -9

-9 + 23 = 14

14 - 31 = -17

-17 + 15 = -2

So, the sum is indeed -2, which matches what I found earlier by evaluating f(0). That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2.
</think>

The sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) is found by evaluating \( g(1) \), which is equivalent to \( f(0) \). Calculating \( f(0) \) for \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \) gives:

\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2

"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line defined by the equation y = 2x - 2. Hmm, okay. I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. So, I think I need to find the perpendicular line from (6, 0) to the given line and then calculate the distance between these two points.

First, let me recall the formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line ax + by + c = 0. I think it's |ax₀ + by₀ + c| divided by the square root of (a² + b²). Yeah, that sounds right. So, maybe I can use this formula instead of finding the perpendicular line. That might be quicker.

But wait, the given line is in slope-intercept form, y = 2x - 2. I need to convert this into the standard form ax + by + c = 0. Let me subtract 2x and add 2 to both sides to get -2x + y + 2 = 0. Hmm, but usually, we like the coefficient of x to be positive, so maybe I can multiply the entire equation by -1 to get 2x - y - 2 = 0. So, in standard form, it's 2x - y - 2 = 0. Therefore, a = 2, b = -1, and c = -2.

Now, plugging into the distance formula: |2*6 + (-1)*0 - 2| divided by sqrt(2² + (-1)²). Let's compute the numerator first: 2*6 is 12, minus 0 is still 12, minus 2 is 10. So, the absolute value of 10 is 10. The denominator is sqrt(4 + 1) which is sqrt(5). So, the distance is 10/sqrt(5). But I think it's better to rationalize the denominator, so multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(5) gives (10*sqrt(5))/5, which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). So, the shortest distance is 2√5 units.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me try another method. Maybe finding the equation of the perpendicular line and then finding the intersection point. The given line has a slope of 2, so the perpendicular slope would be -1/2. So, the equation of the perpendicular line passing through (6, 0) would be y - 0 = -1/2(x - 6), which simplifies to y = (-1/2)x + 3.

Now, let's find the intersection point of y = 2x - 2 and y = (-1/2)x + 3. Setting them equal: 2x - 2 = (-1/2)x + 3. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 4x - 4 = -x + 6. Bring all terms to one side: 4x + x - 4 - 6 = 0 => 5x - 10 = 0 => 5x = 10 => x = 2. Plugging back into one of the equations, say y = 2x - 2, gives y = 4 - 2 = 2. So, the intersection point is (2, 2).

Now, the distance between (6, 0) and (2, 2) can be found using the distance formula: sqrt[(6-2)² + (0-2)²] = sqrt[16 + 4] = sqrt[20] = 2*sqrt(5). So, same result as before. That confirms that the shortest distance is indeed 2√5.

I think both methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 2√5 is correct. I should probably present it in the simplest radical form, which it already is.

The shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) is found by converting the line equation to standard form and applying the distance formula. The distance is calculated as \( 2\sqrt{5} \).

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the set of three expressions involving the roots of a quartic equation. The equation given is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), and the roots are \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). The expressions I need to evaluate are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). 

First, I remember that for polynomials, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since this is a quartic equation, I can use Vieta's formulas to find sums and products of roots two at a time, three at a time, and so on. 

Let me write down Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation \(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\). The formulas are:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d\)

In our case, the equation is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), so \(a = 2\), \(b = 0\) (since there's no \(x^2\) term), \(c = 0\) (since there's no \(x\) term), and \(d = 2\). 

So applying Vieta's formulas:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

Now, the expressions I need to evaluate are of the form \(\alpha_i\alpha_j + \alpha_k\alpha_l\), where \(\{i, j, k, l\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\). There are three such expressions, each pairing the roots into two pairs and adding the products of each pair.

I think these expressions are related to the elementary symmetric sums of the roots, but they are not the standard ones. The standard elementary symmetric sums are the ones given by Vieta's formulas, which are sums of products of roots taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. 

But in this case, the expressions are specific pairings. Maybe I can think of them as the roots of a quadratic equation whose roots are these pairings. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the products \(\alpha_i\alpha_j\) as variables and find their sums.

Wait, let me think. If I denote \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\), then I need to find the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\).

I recall that for quartic equations, the products of roots two at a time can be related to the roots of a quadratic equation. Specifically, if I consider the products \(\alpha_i\alpha_j\) as roots of another equation, then the sums \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) would be the roots of a cubic equation, perhaps. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the elementary symmetric sums of the products. Let me see.

The sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\) would be equal to the sum of all possible products of two roots, which is given by Vieta's formula as 0. So \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\).

That's one equation. Now, I need more information to find the individual values of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). Maybe I can find the sum of their squares or something like that.

Let me compute \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\). Expanding each square:

\(S_1^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4\)

Similarly,

\(S_2^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4\)

\(S_3^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3\)

Adding them together:

\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = [(\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2] + 2[\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3]\)

Simplify the terms:

First, the sum of squares of all products two at a time. From Vieta, we know that the sum of all products two at a time is 0. But the sum of squares is different. Let me denote \(P = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\). Then, the sum of squares is \(P^2 - 2Q\), where \(Q\) is the sum of products of the products two at a time. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, the sum of squares of all products two at a time is equal to \((\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_1\alpha_4)\). Wait, that seems complicated.

Wait, actually, the sum of squares of all products two at a time is equal to \((\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 - 2\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\), where \(i < j\) and \(k < l\), and the products are distinct. But in our case, the sum \(\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j = 0\), so the sum of squares is \(-2 \times \sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\). 

But how many terms are in \(\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\)? For four roots, the product of all four is just \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\). But when considering products of two pairs, each product is \(\alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\) where \(\{i, j, k, l\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\). So each term is 2, but how many such terms are there?

Wait, actually, each product of two distinct pairs is equal to \(\alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\), but since the product is commutative, each product is counted multiple times. Specifically, for each pair, the product is the same as the product of the complementary pair. So, for four roots, the number of ways to split into two pairs is 3. So, the sum \(\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\) is equal to 3 times the product of all four roots, which is 3*2=6.

Wait, let me think again. If I have four roots, the number of ways to partition them into two pairs is 3. Each partition corresponds to a product of two pairs. So, for each partition, the product is \(\alpha_i\alpha_j \times \alpha_k\alpha_l\). Since each such product is equal to \(\alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\), which is equal to \((\alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l)\). But since all four roots are multiplied, it's equal to \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\). So each product is 2, and there are 3 such products, so the sum is 3*2=6.

Therefore, the sum of squares of all products two at a time is \(-2*6 = -12\). Wait, but that can't be, because squares are non-negative. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, actually, the formula is:

\[
\left(\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\right)^2 = \sum (\alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 + 2\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l
\]

So, rearranged:

\[
\sum (\alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 = \left(\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\right)^2 - 2\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l
\]

Given that \(\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j = 0\), this becomes:

\[
\sum (\alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 = 0 - 2 \times 6 = -12
\]

But that's impossible because the sum of squares can't be negative. So, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe the sum \(\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\) is not 6. Let me recast it.

Each term in \(\sum \alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\) is the product of two pairs, but each such product is equal to \(\alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\). However, since the product is commutative, each product is counted multiple times. Specifically, for four roots, the number of distinct products of two pairs is 3, each equal to the product of all four roots, which is 2. So, the sum is 3*2=6. So, that part seems correct.

But then, the sum of squares is \(-12\), which is negative, but squares are non-negative. So, that can't be. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should not be considering the sum of squares of all products two at a time, but rather the sum of squares of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). Let me try that.

So, \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2\).

Expanding each term:

\(S_1^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4\)

Similarly,

\(S_2^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4\)

\(S_3^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3\)

Adding them together:

\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = [(\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2] + 2[\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3]\)

Simplify the terms:

"Determine the decimal expansion of the fraction 137/500 by performing long division.

First, set up the long division of 137 by 500. Since 137 is less than 500, the whole number part is 0, and we proceed with the division by adding a decimal point and zeros to 137.

Multiply 137 by 10 to get 1370 and divide by 500. 500 goes into 1370 two times, which gives 1000. Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get 370.

Bring down the next 0 to make it 3700. Divide 3700 by 500, which is 7 times, resulting in 3500. Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get 200.

Bring down another 0 to make it 2000. Divide 2000 by 500, which is exactly 4 times, giving 2000. Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get 0.

"Alright, so I have this problem about a quadrilateral ABCD with center O. The ratio of AB to AD is given as k. A point is randomly chosen inside this quadrilateral, and I need to find the probability that this point is closer to O than to any of the four corners A, B, C, or D. Hmm, okay.

First, let me try to visualize the quadrilateral. The Asymptote code draws a rectangle with points A, B, C, D and center O. So, it's a rectangle centered at O. That makes sense because in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so O is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, ABCD is a rectangle, and O is the center.

Given that AB/AD = k, so the sides AB and AD are in the ratio k. Let me denote AB as the length and AD as the width. So, if AB = k * AD, then the rectangle is k times as long as it is wide. Depending on the value of k, it could be a square if k=1, or a longer rectangle otherwise.

Now, the problem is about probability. We need to find the probability that a randomly selected point inside the rectangle is closer to the center O than to any of the four vertices. So, essentially, we need to find the area within the rectangle where any point in that area is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D. Then, the probability would be the ratio of this area to the total area of the rectangle.

To approach this, I think I need to determine the region within the rectangle where the distance from a point to O is less than the distance to any of the four vertices. This region is called the Voronoi region for the point O with respect to the four vertices. Voronoi regions partition the space such that each region consists of points closer to a particular site (in this case, O) than to any other site.

So, to find this region, I can consider the perpendicular bisectors between O and each of the four vertices. The intersection of these bisectors will form the boundaries of the Voronoi region around O.

Let me denote the coordinates to make it easier. Let's place the rectangle in a coordinate system with O at the origin (0,0). Let’s assume that the rectangle has length 2a along the x-axis and width 2b along the y-axis. So, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- A: (-a, b)
- B: (a, b)
- C: (a, -b)
- D: (-a, -b)

Given that AB/AD = k, let's compute AB and AD in terms of a and b.

AB is the distance between A and B, which is sqrt[(a - (-a))^2 + (b - b)^2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + 0] = 2a.

AD is the distance between A and D, which is sqrt[(-a - (-a))^2 + (-b - b)^2] = sqrt[0 + (-2b)^2] = 2b.

So, AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. Therefore, a = k*b.

So, the rectangle has dimensions 2a by 2b, with a = k*b.

Now, the total area of the rectangle is (2a)(2b) = 4ab = 4k b^2.

Next, I need to find the area where the distance from a point (x, y) to O (0,0) is less than the distance to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D.

The distance from (x, y) to O is sqrt(x^2 + y^2).

The distance from (x, y) to A is sqrt[(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2].

Similarly, the distance to B is sqrt[(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2], to C is sqrt[(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2], and to D is sqrt[(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2].

We need to find the set of points (x, y) such that sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt[(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2], sqrt[(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2], sqrt[(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2], and sqrt[(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2].

To simplify, let's square both sides of each inequality to remove the square roots.

First inequality: x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2

Expanding the right side: (x^2 + 2ax + a^2) + (y^2 - 2by + b^2) = x^2 + y^2 + 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2

Subtracting x^2 + y^2 from both sides: 0 < 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2

So, 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0

Similarly, for the second inequality: x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2

Expanding the right side: (x^2 - 2ax + a^2) + (y^2 - 2by + b^2) = x^2 + y^2 - 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2

Subtracting x^2 + y^2: 0 < -2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2

So, -2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0

Third inequality: x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2

Expanding: (x^2 - 2ax + a^2) + (y^2 + 2by + b^2) = x^2 + y^2 - 2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2

Subtracting x^2 + y^2: 0 < -2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2

Fourth inequality: x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2

Expanding: (x^2 + 2ax + a^2) + (y^2 + 2by + b^2) = x^2 + y^2 + 2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2

Subtracting x^2 + y^2: 0 < 2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2

So, now we have four inequalities:

1. 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0
2. -2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0
3. -2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0
4. 2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0

These are linear inequalities, so they represent half-planes. The region where all four inequalities are satisfied is the intersection of these four half-planes, which should be a convex polygon, likely a quadrilateral or a region bounded by four lines.

Let me try to rewrite these inequalities in a more manageable form.

Divide each inequality by 2:

1. ax - by + (a^2 + b^2)/2 > 0
2. -ax - by + (a^2 + b^2)/2 > 0
3. -ax + by + (a^2 + b^2)/2 > 0
4. ax + by + (a^2 + b^2)/2 > 0

Let me denote (a^2 + b^2)/2 as C for simplicity. So, C = (a^2 + b^2)/2.

Then, the inequalities become:

1. ax - by + C > 0
2. -ax - by + C > 0
3. -ax + by + C > 0
4. ax + by + C > 0

So, these are four lines:

1. ax - by = -C
2. -ax - by = -C
3. -ax + by = -C
4. ax + by = -C

Each of these lines is a boundary between the regions where the inequality holds and where it doesn't. The region we are interested in is where all four inequalities hold, so it's the intersection of the four half-planes defined by these lines.

Let me try to find the equations of these lines.

1. ax - by = -C
2. -ax - by = -C
3. -ax + by = -C
4. ax + by = -C

Let me solve for y in each case to get a better idea.

1. From ax - by = -C: by = ax + C => y = (a/b)x + C/b
2. From -ax - by = -C: by = -ax + C => y = (-a/b)x + C/b
3. From -ax + by = -C: by = ax - C => y = (a/b)x - C/b
4. From ax + by = -C: by = -ax - C => y = (-a/b)x - C/b

So, these are four lines with slopes of ±a/b and intercepts of ±C/b.

Given that a = k*b, let's substitute that in.

So, a = k*b, so a/b = k, and C = (a^2 + b^2)/2 = (k^2 b^2 + b^2)/2 = b^2(k^2 + 1)/2.

Therefore, C/b = b(k^2 + 1)/2.

So, the equations become:

1. y = kx + (b(k^2 + 1)/2)
2. y = -kx + (b(k^2 + 1)/2)
3. y = kx - (b(k^2 + 1)/2)
4. y = -kx - (b(k^2 + 1)/2)

So, these are four lines with slopes k and -k, and intercepts at ±(b(k^2 + 1)/2).

Now, let's plot these lines mentally. The lines with positive slope (k) are y = kx + c and y = kx - c, and the lines with negative slope (-k) are y = -kx + c and y = -kx - c, where c = b(k^2 + 1)/2.

These lines form a diamond or a rectangle? Wait, actually, since they have slopes k and -k, they form a diamond shape, but depending on the value of k, it could be a square or a rhombus.

But in our case, since the original figure is a rectangle, the intersection of these four lines will form another rectangle or a diamond inside the original rectangle.

Wait, actually, the region where all four inequalities hold is the intersection of the four half-planes, which is a convex polygon. Given the symmetry, it's likely a rectangle or a diamond.

But let's find the points of intersection of these lines to determine the vertices of the region.

Let me find the intersection points of these lines.

First, find where line 1 intersects line 2.

Line 1: y = kx + c

Line 2: y = -kx + c

Set equal: kx + c = -kx + c => 2kx = 0 => x = 0

Then, y = k*0 + c = c

So, intersection point is (0, c)

Similarly, find intersection of line 1 and line 3.

Line 1: y = kx + c

Line 3: y = kx - c

Set equal: kx + c = kx - c => c = -c => 2c = 0 => c = 0

But c = b(k^2 + 1)/2, which is positive since b and k are positive. So, no solution here. So, lines 1 and 3 are parallel? Wait, no, they have the same slope, so they are parallel and don't intersect.

Similarly, lines 1 and 4: Line 1 is y = kx + c, Line 4 is y = -kx - c.

Set equal: kx + c = -kx - c => 2kx = -2c => x = -c/k

Then, y = k*(-c/k) + c = -c + c = 0

So, intersection point is (-c/k, 0)

Similarly, intersection of line 2 and line 3:

Line 2: y = -kx + c

Line 3: y = kx - c

Set equal: -kx + c = kx - c => -2kx = -2c => x = c/k

Then, y = -k*(c/k) + c = -c + c = 0

So, intersection point is (c/k, 0)

Intersection of line 2 and line 4:

Line 2: y = -kx + c

Line 4: y = -kx - c

Set equal: -kx + c = -kx - c => c = -c => 2c = 0 => c = 0, which is not possible. So, lines 2 and 4 are parallel.

Similarly, intersection of line 3 and line 4:

Line 3: y = kx - c

Line 4: y = -kx - c

Set equal: kx - c = -kx - c => 2kx = 0 => x = 0

Then, y = k*0 - c = -c

So, intersection point is (0, -c)

So, the four lines intersect at four points: (0, c), (-c/k, 0), (c/k, 0), and (0, -c). So, these four points form a diamond shape (a rhombus) centered at the origin.

So, the region where all four inequalities hold is this diamond with vertices at (0, c), (-c/k, 0), (c/k, 0), and (0, -c).

Therefore, the area we are interested in is the area of this diamond.

The area of a rhombus is given by (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

In this case, the diagonals are the distances between (0, c) and (0, -c), which is 2c, and between (-c/k, 0) and (c/k, 0), which is 2c/k.

So, area = (2c * 2c/k","[2, '2']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True

"Alright, so I have this magic square puzzle here, and I need to figure out the value of \( n \). Let me try to understand the problem first. It's a 3x3 grid, right? Each row, column, and the two main diagonals should add up to the same total. That's the magic square property. 

Looking at the Asymptote code, it draws a 3x3 grid with some numbers already filled in, and some are expressed in terms of \( n \). My job is to find the value of \( n \) such that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum up to the same number.

Let me write down the grid as given. The rows are from top to bottom, and the columns are from left to right. So, the grid looks like this:

Top row (first row):
- First cell: \( n - 3 \)
- Second cell: 3
- Third cell: \( n + 1 \)

Middle row:
- First cell: \( n + 2 \)
- Second cell: \( 2n - 9 \)
- Third cell: 1

Bottom row:
- First cell: 2
- Second cell: \( n \)
- Third cell: \( n - 1 \)

So, in matrix form, it's:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n - 3 & 3 & n + 1 \\
\hline
n + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n - 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, since it's a magic square, all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals should add up to the same sum. Let's denote this common sum as \( S \).

First, let's compute the sum of the first row. The sum of the first row is:

\( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) \)

Simplify that:

\( n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 \)

So, the first row sum is \( 2n + 1 \). Therefore, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Now, let's compute the sum of the second row:

\( (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 \)

Simplify:

\( n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 \)

So, the second row sum is \( 3n - 6 \). Since all rows must sum to \( S \), we can set this equal to \( 2n + 1 \):

\( 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \)

Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:

\( n - 6 = 1 \)

Add 6 to both sides:

\( n = 7 \)

Wait, so is \( n = 7 \)? Let me check this because I might have made a mistake. Let me verify by plugging \( n = 7 \) back into the grid and see if all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same sum.

First, substitute \( n = 7 \) into each cell:

Top row:
- \( n - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4 \)
- 3
- \( n + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8 \)
So, top row: 4, 3, 8. Sum: 4 + 3 + 8 = 15.

Middle row:
- \( n + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9 \)
- \( 2n - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5 \)
- 1
So, middle row: 9, 5, 1. Sum: 9 + 5 + 1 = 15.

Bottom row:
- 2
- \( n = 7 \)
- \( n - 1 = 6 \)
So, bottom row: 2, 7, 6. Sum: 2 + 7 + 6 = 15.

Okay, so all rows sum to 15. Good.

Now, let's check the columns.

First column:
- Top: 4
- Middle: 9
- Bottom: 2
Sum: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15.

Second column:
- Top: 3
- Middle: 5
- Bottom: 7
Sum: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

Third column:
- Top: 8
- Middle: 1
- Bottom: 6
Sum: 8 + 1 + 6 = 15.

Perfect, all columns sum to 15.

Now, let's check the diagonals.

Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
- Top-left: 4
- Middle: 5
- Bottom-right: 6
Sum: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
- Top-right: 8
- Middle: 5
- Bottom-left: 2
Sum: 8 + 5 + 2 = 15.

Everything checks out! So, \( n = 7 \) is indeed the correct value.

But just to be thorough, let me make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in my initial calculations. I set the first row sum equal to the second row sum, which gave me \( n = 7 \). Then, substituting back, all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, which is consistent.

Alternatively, I could have used another row or column to solve for \( n \). Let me try the third row just to confirm.

Third row:
- 2
- \( n \)
- \( n - 1 \)
Sum: 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1.

Wait, that's the same as the first row's sum, which is \( 2n + 1 \). So, if the third row is also equal to \( S \), which is 15, then:

\( 2n + 1 = 15 \)

Subtract 1:

\( 2n = 14 \)

Divide by 2:

\( n = 7 \)

Same result. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, let's check the second column:

Second column:
- Top: 3
- Middle: \( 2n - 9 \)
- Bottom: \( n \)
Sum: 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6.

Set this equal to \( S = 2n + 1 \):

\( 3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \)

Subtract \( 2n \):

\( n - 6 = 1 \)

Add 6:

\( n = 7 \)

Same answer again. So, all methods point to \( n = 7 \).

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the checks confirm that \( n = 7 \) is correct.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( n \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

Given a 3x3 magic square where each row, column, and the two main diagonals sum to the same total, we need to find the value of \( n \).

The grid is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

\hline
n + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\

\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the first row:
\[
(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1
\]
This sum is denoted as \( S \).

Next, we calculate the sum of the second row:
\[
(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since all rows must sum to \( S \), we set this equal to \( 2n + 1 \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
n - 6 = 1 \implies n = 7
\]

We verify this by substituting \( n = 7 \) back into the grid and checking all rows, columns, and diagonals:

- Top row: \( 4, 3, 8 \) sums to 15.
- Middle row: \( 9, 5, 1 \) sums to 15.
- Bottom row: \( 2, 7, 6 \) sums to 15.
- First column: \( 4, 9, 2 \) sums to 15.
- Second column: \( 3, 5, 7 \) sums to 15.
- Third column: \( 8, 1, 6 \) sums to 15.
- Main diagonal: \( 4, 5, 6 \) sums to 15.
- Other diagonal: \( 8, 5, 2 \) sums to 15.

All rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15, confirming that \( n = 7 \) is correct.

The value of \( n \) is \boxed{7}.","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Alright, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find the possible values of the expression (1)/(1 + ω) + (1)/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that ω being a cube root of unity means it's a solution to the equation x³ = 1. The solutions to this equation are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. These are the cube roots of unity. So, ω and ω² are the non-real roots, and they satisfy certain properties. I think one of the key properties is that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Let me verify that.

Yes, if we factor x³ - 1, we get (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) = 0. So, the roots are 1, and the roots of x² + x + 1 = 0, which are ω and ω². Therefore, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That's a useful identity.

So, knowing that, maybe I can use this to simplify the given expression. Let me write down the expression again:

(1)/(1 + ω) + (1)/(1 + ω²)

I need to compute this sum. Maybe I can combine the fractions. To do that, I'll find a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute that.

First, let's compute the numerator:

1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω) = (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω²

So, the numerator is 2 + ω + ω². Now, the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand that:

(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³

But wait, ω³ is given as 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, the denominator becomes:

1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²

So, the denominator is also 2 + ω + ω². Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:

(2 + ω + ω²)/(2 + ω + ω²) = 1

Wait, so the expression simplifies to 1? That seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I combined the fractions:

1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = (2 + ω + ω²) / (2 + ω + ω²) = 1

Yes, that seems correct. But let me think again. Since ω is a cube root of unity, and we know that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 - 1 = 1. So, the numerator is 1, and the denominator is also 1, so the expression is indeed 1.

Wait, hold on. If 1 + ω + ω² = 0, then ω + ω² = -1. So, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 - 1 = 1. Therefore, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, so the expression is 1. So, the value is 1.

But the question says ""sਾਰੇ ਸੰਭਾਵਿਤ ਮੁੱਲ ਲੱਭੋ"". Translating that, it means ""find all possible values"". So, is the expression always equal to 1, regardless of which ω we take?

Wait, ω can be 1, ω, or ω². But in the problem statement, it says ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. So, ω could be 1, but if ω = 1, then the expression becomes 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, even if ω is 1, the expression is still 1.

But wait, if ω is 1, then 1 + ω = 2, and 1 + ω² = 2, so each term is 1/2, adding up to 1. So, regardless of whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the expression is 1.

But hold on, if ω is 1, then ω² is also 1, so the expression is still 1. So, in all cases, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

Wait, but let me test it with ω = ω. Let's compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Since ω² is the conjugate of ω, maybe I can compute it numerically.

Let me recall that ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. Similarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3) = cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.

So, let's compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).

First, compute 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.

So, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). Let me compute this.

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

1/(1/2 + i√3/2) = (1/2 - i√3/2) / [ (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ] = (1/2 - i√3/2) / (1/4 + 3/4) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.

Similarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2) = (1/2 + i√3/2) / [ (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ] = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Now, adding these two:

(1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = (1/2 + 1/2) + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.

So, yes, it's 1. So, whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the expression is 1.

Wait, but if ω is 1, then 1 + ω = 2, and 1 + ω² = 2, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the expression always equals 1, regardless of the value of ω (as long as ω³ = 1). So, the only possible value is 1.

But the question says ""sਾਰੇ ਸੰਭਾਵਿਤ ਮੁੱਲ ਲੱਭੋ"", which is ""find all possible values"". So, since the expression always equals 1, the only possible value is 1.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a case where the expression could be undefined? For example, if 1 + ω = 0 or 1 + ω² = 0, then the expression would be undefined. But 1 + ω = 0 would imply ω = -1, but ω³ = 1, so ω = -1 would imply (-1)^3 = -1 = 1, which is not true. So, 1 + ω ≠ 0, and similarly 1 + ω² ≠ 0. Therefore, the expression is always defined and equals 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

**Final Answer**
The only possible value is \boxed{1}.

Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we need to find the possible values of the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

First, we note that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, so it satisfies the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\).

We start by combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

To combine these, we find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

The numerator simplifies to:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + 1 + \omega = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]

Using the property \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we know \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, the numerator becomes:

\[
2 + (-1) = 1
\]

Next, we expand the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), this simplifies to:

\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]

Again, using \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), the denominator becomes:

\[
2 + (-1) = 1
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is:

\[

"Alright, so I have this problem where there are four points: A, B, C, and D. They form a sort of network with various lines connecting them, and each line has a specific length labeled. The question is asking for the shortest distance among all these points. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, I need to figure out the coordinates of each point because that might help me calculate the distances between them. The Asymptote code gives me some coordinates: A is at (-3,3), B is at (3,0), C is at (0,-4), and D is at (0,0). So, D is the origin. That should make things a bit easier.

Let me write down the coordinates:

- A: (-3, 3)
- B: (3, 0)
- C: (0, -4)
- D: (0, 0)

Now, the problem mentions that each pair of points is connected, and each connection has a specific length. The labels are as follows:

- D to B: 3 units
- A to B: 6 units
- A to C: 6 units
- D to C: 4 units
- A to D: 5 units
- C to B: 5 units

Wait a second, I can verify these distances using the distance formula. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Let me check a few of these to make sure.

First, distance from D(0,0) to B(3,0): sqrt[(3-0)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt[9 + 0] = 3. That matches the label.

Distance from A(-3,3) to B(3,0): sqrt[(3 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2] = sqrt[(6)^2 + (-3)^2] = sqrt[36 + 9] = sqrt[45] = 3*sqrt(5) ≈ 6.708. But the label says 6. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe the labels are approximate or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me recalculate. A is (-3,3), B is (3,0). So, x difference is 6, y difference is -3. So, distance is sqrt(6^2 + (-3)^2) = sqrt(36 + 9) = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708. But the label says 6. Maybe it's an approximate value? Or perhaps the coordinates are different? Wait, the Asymptote code defines A as (-3,3), so maybe the labels are approximate. Alternatively, maybe the figure is not to scale.

Similarly, distance from A(-3,3) to C(0,-4): sqrt[(0 - (-3))^2 + (-4 - 3)^2] = sqrt[3^2 + (-7)^2] = sqrt[9 + 49] = sqrt[58] ≈ 7.616. But the label says 6. Again, discrepancy.

Distance from D(0,0) to C(0,-4): sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2] = sqrt[0 + 16] = 4. That matches.

Distance from A(-3,3) to D(0,0): sqrt[(0 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2] = sqrt[9 + 9] = sqrt[18] ≈ 4.243. But the label says 5. Hmm, another discrepancy.

Distance from C(0,-4) to B(3,0): sqrt[(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - (-4))^2] = sqrt[9 + 16] = sqrt[25] = 5. That matches.

So, some of the distances don't match the labels. Maybe the labels are approximate or maybe the figure is not drawn to scale. But since the problem is asking for the shortest distance among all these points, perhaps I should consider the actual coordinates and calculate the distances accordingly.

Wait, but the problem says ""ਜੇ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਬਿੰਦੂ $A$, $B$, $C$, ਜਾਂ $D$ ਤੋਂ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਤਿੰਨ ਬਿੰਦੂਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਦੌਰਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਤਾਂ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਛੋਟੀ ਦੂਰੀ ਕਿਹੜੀ ਹੈ?"" which translates to ""Starting from any of the points A, B, C, or D, and visiting the other three points once, what is the shortest distance?""

Oh, so it's asking for the shortest possible route that starts at one point and visits the other three exactly once. That sounds like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for four points. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each point exactly once and returns to the starting point. But since it doesn't specify returning, maybe it's just the shortest path that visits all four points starting from any one.

Wait, but the problem says ""ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਬਿੰਦੂ ਤੋਂ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਤਿੰਨ ਬਿੰਦੂਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਦੌਰਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਤਾਂ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਛੋਟੀ ਦੂਰੀ ਕਿਹੜੀ ਹੈ?"" So, it's starting from any point, visiting the other three once, and then... does it have to return? The wording is a bit unclear. It says ""ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਦੌਰਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਤਾਂ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਛੋਟੀ ਦੂਰੀ ਕਿਹੜੀ ਹੈ?"" which translates to ""visiting the other three points once, what is the shortest distance?"" So, maybe it's just the sum of the distances from the starting point to each of the other three points, but that doesn't make much sense because that would be the total distance, not the path.

Alternatively, it might be asking for the shortest path that starts at one point, visits the other three, and ends at some point, possibly returning to the start. But without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it draws D connected to B, C, and A, and also connects A to B and A to C. So, the figure is a network with D at the center connected to A, B, and C, and A connected to B and C as well. So, the figure is like a central hub at D connected to A, B, and C, and A is also connected to B and C.

Given that, the problem is to find the shortest path that starts at any point, visits the other three exactly once, and then... does it have to return? The problem statement isn't entirely clear. But in TSP terms, usually, you have to return to the starting point, making it a cycle. But since the problem says ""ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਦੌਰਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਤਾਂ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਛੋਟੀ ਦੂਰੀ ਕਿਹੜੀ ਹੈ?"" which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the total distance of the path, not necessarily a cycle.

But in the Asymptote code, it's drawing D connected to B, C, and A, and A connected to B and C. So, the figure is a graph with edges between D-A, D-B, D-C, A-B, A-C, and B-C. So, it's a complete graph with four nodes.

Given that, the problem is to find the shortest possible path that starts at any node, visits the other three exactly once, and then... I think it's asking for the shortest Hamiltonian path, which is the shortest path that visits each node exactly once. But sometimes, people refer to TSP as the cycle, but in this case, since it's not specified to return, maybe it's just the path.

But let's think about the problem again. It says ""ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਬਿੰਦੂ ਤੋਂ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਅਤੇ ਹੋਰ ਤਿੰਨ ਬਿੰਦੂਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਇੱਕ ਵਾਰ ਦੌਰਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਤਾਂ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਛੋਟੀ ਦੂਰੀ ਕਿਹੜੀ ਹੈ?"" So, it's starting from any point, visiting the other three once, and the total distance is the sum of the distances from the starting point to each of the other three? Or is it the total path length?

Wait, if it's the total path length, then it's a path that goes through all four points, starting at one and ending at another, visiting each exactly once. So, it's a Hamiltonian path, and we need the shortest one.

Alternatively, if it's the total distance from the starting point to each of the other three, that would be three separate distances, but that doesn't make much sense because it's not a path but three separate trips.

Given the Asymptote code, it's drawing all the connections, so it's a complete graph. So, the problem is to find the shortest Hamiltonian path in this graph.

But let's see. Since the figure is given, maybe the distances are as labeled, even if the coordinates don't match exactly. So, perhaps the distances are as labeled: 3, 6, 6, 4, 5, 5.

Wait, let me list all the edges with their lengths:

- D-B: 3
- A-B: 6
- A-C: 6
- D-C: 4
- A-D: 5
- C-B: 5

So, the edges are:

D-B: 3

A-B: 6

A-C: 6

D-C: 4

A-D: 5

C-B: 5

So, the graph has these edges with these lengths.

So, the problem is to find the shortest path that starts at any node, visits the other three exactly once, and then... I think it's the total distance of the path, not necessarily returning.

So, in graph terms, it's the shortest Hamiltonian path.

Given that, we can approach this by considering all possible paths starting from each node and calculate their total distances, then pick the shortest one.

But since there are four nodes, each with 3! = 6 possible paths, that's 4*6=24 possible paths. But since some paths are symmetric, maybe we can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, since the graph is small, we can list all possible Hamiltonian paths and compute their total distances.

Let me list all possible Hamiltonian paths starting from each node.

Starting from D:

1. D -> A -> B -> C
2. D -> A -> C -> B
3. D -> B -> A -> C
4. D -> B -> C -> A
5. D -> C -> A -> B
6. D -> C -> B -> A

Starting from A:

7. A -> D -> B -> C
8. A -> D -> C -> B
9. A -> B -> D -> C
10. A -> B -> C -> D
11. A -> C -> D -> B
12. A -> C -> B -> D

Starting from B:

13. B -> D -> A -> C
14. B -> D -> C -> A
15. B -> A -> D -> C
16. B -> A -> C -> D
17. B -> C -> D -> A
18. B -> C -> A -> D

Starting from C:

19. C -> D -> A -> B
20. C -> D -> B -> A
21. C -> A -> D -> B
22. C -> A -> B -> D
23. C -> B -> D -> A
24. C -> B -> A -> D

Now, for each of these 24 paths, I need to calculate the total distance.

But before that, maybe I can find a way to compute the distances using the given edge lengths.

Wait, but the problem is that the coordinates don't match the distances. For example, distance from A to D is given as 5, but according to coordinates, it's sqrt(18) ≈ 4.243. Similarly, distance from A to B is 6, but according to coordinates, it's sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708. So, the labels are different from the actual coordinates.

Therefore, perhaps the distances are as per the labels, not the coordinates. So, maybe the figure is not to scale, and the distances are as given: 3, 6, 6, 4, 5, 5.

So, in that case, the graph has edges with the given lengths, regardless of the coordinates.

Therefore, the graph is as follows:

Nodes: A, B, C, D

Edges:

- D-B: 3
- A-B: 6
- A-C: 6
- D-C: 4
- A-D: 5
- C-B: 5

So, the edges are as above.
