"Primeiro, identifico as informações fornecidas no problema:

- Aya caminha 9 quilômetros todas as manhãs.
- Na primeira situação, ela caminha a uma velocidade de \( s \) km/h e leva 4 horas, incluindo \( t \) minutos na cafeteria.
- Na segunda situação, ela caminha a uma velocidade de \( s + 2 \) km/h e leva 2 horas e 24 minutos, incluindo os mesmos \( t \) minutos na cafeteria.
- Precisamos encontrar o tempo total, em minutos, quando ela caminha a \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, incluindo os \( t \) minutos na cafeteria.

Passo 1: Converter os tempos para horas.

- 4 horas já está em horas.
- 2 horas e 24 minutos equivalem a \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2,4 \) horas.

Passo 2: Escrever as equações baseadas no tempo gasto caminhando.

- Na primeira situação: \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \).
- Na segunda situação: \( \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2,4 \).

Passo 3: Resolver o sistema de equações para encontrar \( s \) e \( t \).

Subtraindo a segunda equação da primeira:
\[ \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 4 - 2,4 \]
\[ \frac{9(s + 2) - 9s}{s(s + 2)} = 1,6 \]
\[ \frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1,6 \]
\[ 18 = 1,6s(s + 2) \]
\[ 1,6s^2 + 3,2s - 18 = 0 \]
\[ 8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0 \]
\[ 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0 \]

Resolvendo a equação quadrática:
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \times 4 \times (-45)}}{2 \times 4} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8} \]

Considerando a velocidade positiva:
\[ s = \frac{20}{8} = 2,5 \text{ km/h} \]

Agora, encontrar \( t \):
\[ \frac{9}{2,5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \]
\[ 3,6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \]
\[ \frac{t}{60} = 0,4 \]
\[ t = 24 \text{ minutos} \]

Passo 4: Calcular o tempo total quando a velocidade é \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h.

\[ \frac{9}{3} + \frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0,4 = 3,4 \text{ horas} \]
\[ 3,4 \text{ horas} = 3 \text{ horas e } 24 \text{ minutos} \]

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. That means ABC is a triangle on the circumference of circle ω. Then, D is the point where the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect. So, if I imagine the circle ω with triangle ABC inscribed in it, the tangents at B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime integers, and then find m + n.

Alright, so let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Point D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents from a point outside the circle meet at that point. So, D is outside the circle, and the two tangents from D touch the circle at B and C.

Then, we draw a line from A through D, and it intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P, with D lying on AD. So, we need to find the length of AP.

Hmm, okay. So, maybe I can use some properties of circles, tangents, and power of a point here. Let me recall that the power of point D with respect to circle ω is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from D to ω. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the power of D is DB² = DC². So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω.

Also, since AD is a secant line passing through A and P, the power of point D with respect to ω can also be expressed as DA * DP. So, power of D is DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, and DA, then I can find DP, and then AP would be AD - DP or something? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, actually, the power of point D is equal to DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can compute DB and DA, then I can solve for DP, and then AP would be AD + DP? Wait, no, because D is outside the circle, so AD is the segment from A to D, and then DP is from D to P, which is outside. So, AP is actually AD + DP? Wait, no, because P is on the circle, so AP is the entire length from A to P, which is AD + DP? Hmm, maybe not. Let me clarify.

Wait, actually, when you have a point outside the circle, the power of the point is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the intersection points of any secant line through the point. So, in this case, D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant that intersects the circle at A and P. So, the power of D is equal to DA * DP. But wait, DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But since A is on the circle, DA is actually the length from D to A, which is a tangent? Wait, no, A is on the circle, so DA is a secant, not a tangent.

Wait, hold on. Let me recall the power of a point theorem. If a point lies outside a circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent from the point to the circle, and also equal to the product of the lengths of the entire secant segment and its external segment. So, in this case, since D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant that passes through A and P, then the power of D is DB² = DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P.

But wait, actually, in the power of a point formula, it's the product of the entire secant length and its external part. So, if the secant is from D through A to P, then the power is DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But since A is on the circle, DA is just the length from D to A, and DP is DA + AP? Wait, no, because P is on the circle, so AP is the length from A to P, so DP would be DA + AP? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, let me think again. If I have a point D outside the circle, and a secant that goes through D, passes through A, and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the power of D is equal to DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But since A is on the circle, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P, which is DA + AP? Wait, no, because P is on the circle, so AP is the chord from A to P, but DP is the entire length from D to P, which is DA + AP? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, actually, no. If you have a point D outside the circle, and a secant that goes through D, intersects the circle at A and P, then the power of D is equal to DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But in this case, since A is on the circle, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P, which is DA + AP? Wait, no, because P is on the circle, so AP is the chord from A to P, but DP is the distance from D to P, which is DA + AP only if P is on the same line beyond A. But in reality, P is on the circle, so depending on the position, it could be that DP is DA - AP or DA + AP. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram mentally. Point D is outside the circle, and AD is a secant that goes through A and intersects the circle again at P. So, starting from D, going through A, and then to P. So, the distance from D to A is DA, and from D to P is DP, which is DA + AP. So, yes, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, the power of D is DA * DP = DA * (DA + AP). But also, the power of D is equal to DB², since DB is the tangent from D to the circle.

So, we have DB² = DA * (DA + AP). So, if I can find DB and DA, I can solve for AP.

But wait, I don't know DA yet. Hmm. So, maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use harmonic division or something related to poles and polars. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then line BC is the polar of D with respect to circle ω. So, the polar of D is BC. Therefore, by La Hire's theorem, since D lies on the polar of A if and only if A lies on the polar of D. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use inversion. But that might be complicated.

Wait, perhaps using coordinates would help. Let me try to assign coordinates to the triangle ABC and compute everything.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.

Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (9,0), since BC=9. Then, point A is somewhere in the plane. We know AB=5 and AC=10. So, coordinates of A can be found using the distance formula.

Let me denote point A as (x,y). Then, distance from A to B is 5, so sqrt((x)^2 + (y)^2) = 5, so x² + y² = 25.

Distance from A to C is 10, so sqrt((x - 9)^2 + y²) = 10, so (x - 9)² + y² = 100.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x - 9)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 100 - 25

Expanding (x - 9)²: x² - 18x + 81 + y² - x² - y² = 75

Simplify: -18x + 81 = 75

So, -18x = -6 => x = (-6)/(-18) = 1/3.

So, x = 1/3. Then, from x² + y² = 25, we have (1/3)² + y² = 25 => 1/9 + y² = 25 => y² = 25 - 1/9 = 224/9 => y = sqrt(224)/3 = (4*sqrt(14))/3.

So, coordinates of A are (1/3, (4√14)/3).

Alright, so now we have coordinates for A, B, and C.

B is at (0,0), C is at (9,0), A is at (1/3, (4√14)/3).

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

First, let's find the equation of the circumcircle ω. Since we have coordinates for A, B, and C, we can find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Plugging in points B(0,0), C(9,0), and A(1/3, (4√14)/3).

For point B(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.

For point C(9,0): 81 + 0 + 9D + 0 = 0 => 81 + 9D = 0 => D = -9.

So, equation becomes x² + y² - 9x + Ey = 0.

Now, plug in point A(1/3, (4√14)/3):

(1/3)² + ( (4√14)/3 )² - 9*(1/3) + E*(4√14)/3 = 0

Calculate each term:

(1/9) + (16*14)/9 - 3 + (4√14 E)/3 = 0

Simplify:

1/9 + 224/9 - 3 + (4√14 E)/3 = 0

Combine the first two terms: (1 + 224)/9 = 225/9 = 25.

So, 25 - 3 + (4√14 E)/3 = 0 => 22 + (4√14 E)/3 = 0

Solving for E:

(4√14 E)/3 = -22 => E = (-22 * 3)/(4√14) = (-66)/(4√14) = (-33)/(2√14)

Rationalizing the denominator:

E = (-33√14)/(2*14) = (-33√14)/28.

So, the equation of the circle ω is x² + y² - 9x - (33√14)/28 y = 0.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but okay.

Now, we need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to this circle.

First, the tangent at B(0,0). The equation of the tangent to a circle at a point (x₁,y₁) is given by:

x x₁ + y y₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0

Wait, actually, the general equation for the tangent at (x₁,y₁) on the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is:

x x₁ + y y₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F = 0

But since F = 0 in our case, it simplifies.

So, for point B(0,0):

x*0 + y*0 + D*(x + 0)/2 + E*(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0

Simplify:

(D x)/2 + (E y)/2 = 0

Multiply both sides by 2:

D x + E y = 0

We have D = -9, E = (-33√14)/28.

So, the tangent at B is:

-9x + (-33√14)/28 y = 0

Simplify:

-9x - (33√14)/28 y = 0

Multiply both sides by 28 to eliminate denominators:

-252x - 33√14 y = 0

We can write this as:

252x + 33√14 y = 0

Similarly, the tangent at C(9,0). Using the same formula:

x*9 + y*0 + D*(x + 9)/2 + E*(y + 0)/2 + F = 0

Simplify:

9x + D*(x + 9)/2 + E*y/2 = 0

Again, D = -9, E = (-33√14)/28, F=0.

So:

9x + (-9)*(x + 9)/2 + (-33√14)/28 * y / 2 = 0

Simplify term by term:

First term: 9x

Second term: (-9/2)(x + 9) = (-9/2)x - 81/2

Third term: (-33√14)/56 y

So, combining all terms:

9x - (9/2)x - 81/2 - (33√14)/56 y = 0

Combine like terms:

(9x - 4.5x) = 4.5x = 9x/2

So, 9x/2 - 81/2 - (","[81, '81/2 - (']",113,"[113, '113']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. I need to find the probability that after coloring, the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up in positions where originally there were red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then I have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's straightforward.

Now, the key part is figuring out how many colorings satisfy the condition that there's some rotation of the octagon where all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of positions, every blue vertex should land on a red vertex. That means, in the original coloring, the blue vertices must be in positions that, when rotated, don't overlap with any other blue vertices.

Wait, so if I rotate the octagon by k positions, then each blue vertex moves k positions clockwise (or counterclockwise, but since it's regular, it doesn't matter). For all blue vertices to end up on red positions, the set of blue vertices must be such that when shifted by k, none of them coincide with the original blue positions. In other words, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the red vertices after a rotation.

But actually, it's a bit more precise. The condition is that there exists some rotation such that the image of the blue set under that rotation is entirely contained within the red set. So, the blue set must be a subset of the red set after some rotation.

Alternatively, this can be thought of as the blue set being a subset of a rotation of the red set. Since the octagon is regular, the rotations correspond to cyclic shifts. So, the blue set must be a subset of some cyclic shift of the red set.

But maybe another way to think about it is that the blue set must be a subset of the complement of itself under some rotation. Because if you rotate the octagon, the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, the blue set must be a subset of the red set after rotation, which is equivalent to saying that the blue set is a subset of the complement of the blue set under some rotation.

Wait, that might not be the clearest way to put it. Let me try again.

Suppose B is the set of blue vertices. We need that there exists a rotation r such that r(B) is a subset of R, where R is the set of red vertices. But since R is the complement of B, this is equivalent to r(B) ∩ B = empty set. So, the intersection of B and its rotation r(B) must be empty.

Therefore, the condition is that there exists a rotation r such that B and r(B) are disjoint.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets B of the 8 vertices such that there exists a rotation r where B and r(B) are disjoint.

Hmm, okay. So, how do we count such subsets?

First, note that the rotations of the octagon form a cyclic group of order 8. So, the possible rotations are by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. The identity rotation (0 positions) would just leave B unchanged, so unless B is empty, r(B) ∩ B would not be empty. So, we can ignore the identity rotation because it won't help unless B is empty, which is a trivial case.

So, we need to consider rotations by 1 to 7 positions. For each subset B, we need to check if there exists a rotation r (from 1 to 7) such that B and r(B) are disjoint.

Alternatively, for each subset B, we can check if B is a subset of some rotation of the complement of B.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of group actions. The group of rotations acts on the set of subsets, and we're looking for subsets B such that B is disjoint from some rotation of itself.

But perhaps another approach is to consider the concept of ""fixed points"" under rotation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a necklace problem, where we're counting binary necklaces with certain properties.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Suppose we fix a rotation r. For each rotation r, we can count the number of subsets B such that B and r(B) are disjoint. Then, using inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of subsets B such that there exists at least one rotation r where B and r(B) are disjoint.

But inclusion-exclusion might get complicated because the events for different rotations are not independent.

Alternatively, perhaps Burnside's lemma could be useful here, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the possible rotations. Since the octagon is regular, the rotations by k and 8 - k positions are inverses of each other, so they have similar properties.

But maybe it's better to consider each possible rotation and see what constraints they impose on B.

Let me consider the possible rotation shifts: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 positions.

For each shift k, the condition is that B and r_k(B) are disjoint, where r_k is rotation by k positions.

So, for each k, the number of subsets B such that B ∩ r_k(B) = empty set.

But we need the union over all k of these subsets, but without overcounting.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the total number of subsets B such that there exists some k where B and r_k(B) are disjoint.

So, the total number is equal to the union over k=1 to 7 of the sets S_k, where S_k is the set of subsets B with B ∩ r_k(B) = empty.

So, |S| = |Union_{k=1}^7 S_k|.

To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion:

|S| = Sum_{k=1}^7 |S_k| - Sum_{1 <= k < l <=7} |S_k ∩ S_l| + Sum_{1 <= k < l < m <=7} |S_k ∩ S_l ∩ S_m| - ... + (-1)^{n+1} |S_1 ∩ S_2 ∩ ... ∩ S_7}|.

But this seems complicated because the intersections can get messy.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find for each subset B, the number of rotations k such that B and r_k(B) are disjoint, and then use some combinatorial arguments.

Wait, but maybe it's better to think about the structure of B.

If B is a subset such that there exists a rotation k where B and r_k(B) are disjoint, then B must be a subset that is ""shifted"" by k and doesn't overlap with itself.

This is similar to the concept of a ""shifted"" set in combinatorics.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each vertex is a subset, and edges represent the shift condition, but that might not be helpful.

Wait, another thought: if B is a subset such that B and r_k(B) are disjoint, then the union of B and r_k(B) is a subset of size 2|B|, but since the octagon has only 8 vertices, 2|B| <= 8, so |B| <=4.

Wait, that's an important point. If B and r_k(B) are disjoint, then |B| + |r_k(B)| = 2|B| <=8, so |B| <=4.

Therefore, only subsets of size 0,1,2,3,4 can satisfy the condition for some k.

But actually, even more, for a given k, the maximum size of B such that B and r_k(B) are disjoint is floor(8 / gcd(k,8)).

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If we rotate by k positions, the number of positions each element is shifted is k. So, the shift by k partitions the octagon into cycles, each of length equal to the order of k in the additive group modulo 8.

The order of k modulo 8 is 8 / gcd(k,8). So, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8), each of length 8 / gcd(k,8).

Therefore, for B and r_k(B) to be disjoint, B must not contain any two elements from the same cycle. Because if B contains an element from a cycle, then r_k(B) would contain the next element in the cycle, so they can't both be in B.

Wait, actually, more precisely, if B contains any element from a cycle, then r_k(B) would contain the next element in the cycle, so B and r_k(B) would intersect if B contains any two consecutive elements in the cycle.

Wait, no, actually, if B contains an element, then r_k(B) contains the element shifted by k. So, if B contains an element x, then r_k(B) contains x + k. So, for B and r_k(B) to be disjoint, B cannot contain both x and x + k for any x.

Therefore, B must be a subset such that it doesn't contain any pair of elements that are k apart.

This is similar to a set with no two elements at distance k.

So, for each k, the number of subsets B such that B and r_k(B) are disjoint is equal to the number of subsets of the octagon with no two elements at distance k.

This is similar to the concept of independent sets in a graph where edges connect vertices at distance k.

So, for each k, the number of such subsets is equal to the number of independent sets in the graph where each vertex is connected to its k-th neighbor.

But for a cycle graph, the number of independent sets is known, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, but for a cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets is F(n) + F(n-2), where F(n) is the Fibonacci sequence, but I might be misremembering.

Wait, actually, the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_n is equal to F(n-1) + F(n+1), where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number. Let me check for small n.

For n=3, the cycle graph C3 has 3 vertices. The independent sets are: empty set, {1}, {2}, {3}. So, 4. Fibonacci numbers: F(2)=1, F(4)=3. So, 1 + 3 = 4. That works.

For n=4, C4. Independent sets: empty, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,3}, {2,4}. So, 6. F(3)=2, F(5)=5. 2 + 5 =7. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe my formula is wrong.

Wait, actually, the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C_n is F(n) + F(n-2). For n=3: F(3)=2, F(1)=1. 2 +1=3, which is less than 4. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.

For a path graph P_n, the number of independent sets is F(n+2). For a cycle graph C_n, it's F(n) + F(n-2). Wait, for n=3: F(3)=2, F(1)=1. 2 +1=3, but we have 4 independent sets. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think recursively. For a cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets is equal to the number of independent sets on P_n minus the number of independent sets where both the first and last vertices are included, because in a cycle, including both would create an edge.

So, for P_n, the number is F(n+2). For C_n, it's F(n+2) - F(n-2). Let's test for n=3: F(5)=5, F(1)=1. 5 -1=4, which matches. For n=4: F(6)=8, F(2)=1. 8 -1=7, but earlier I thought C4 has 6 independent sets. Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, for C4: vertices 1,2,3,4. Independent sets:

- Empty set: 1

- Single vertices: 4

- Pairs: {1,3}, {2,4}: 2

Total: 1 + 4 + 2 =7. So, actually, it's 7. So, my initial count was wrong. So, the formula F(n+2) - F(n-2) works.

So, for C_n, the number of independent sets is F(n+2) - F(n-2).

Therefore, for each k, the number of subsets B such that B and r_k(B) are disjoint is equal to the number of independent sets on C_8 where edges connect vertices at distance k.

Wait, but in our case, the graph is not a cycle graph, but rather a graph where each vertex is connected to its k-th neighbor. So, for k=1, it's the cycle graph C8. For k=2, it's two disjoint cycles of length 4, because gcd(2,8)=2. Similarly, for k=3, gcd(3,8)=1, so it's a single cycle of length 8. For k=4, gcd(4,8)=4, so it's four disjoint edges.

Wait, so depending on k, the graph structure changes.

Therefore, for each k, the graph G_k is a union of cycles, each of length 8 / gcd(k,8). So, the number of connected components is gcd(k,8), each being a cycle of length 8 / gcd(k,8).

Therefore, the number of independent sets on G_k is the product of the number of independent sets on each cycle component.

So, for example, for k=1: G_1 is C8, so the number of independent sets is F(8+2) - F(8-2) = F(10) - F(6). F(10)=55, F(6)=8, so 55 -8=47.

Wait, but earlier for C3, it was F(5)-F(1)=5-1=4, which was correct. So, for C8, it's F(10)-F(6)=55-8=47.

Similarly, for k=2: G_2 consists of two cycles of length 4 each. So, the number of independent sets is [F(4+2) - F(4-2)]^2 = [F(6)-F(2)]^2 = (8 -1)^2=49.

Wait, but actually, for each","[49, '49']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). The functions \( f \) and \( g \) are defined as \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) and \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I should probably understand what the functions \( f \) and \( g \) look like. They are both absolute value functions, so they will have V-shapes. Let me sketch them mentally.

Starting with \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \). The inner absolute value \( |x| \) makes it symmetric about the y-axis. Then subtracting \( \frac{1}{2} \) shifts it down by 0.5 units. Taking the absolute value of that result will reflect any negative parts back up. So, the graph of \( f(x) \) will have a V-shape with its vertex at \( x = 0 \), but shifted. Let me think: when \( |x| = \frac{1}{2} \), the expression inside the absolute value becomes zero, so that's a critical point. So, the graph of \( f(x) \) will have a V-shape with the vertex at \( (0, 0) \), but it will touch the x-axis at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). Wait, no, actually, when \( |x| = \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = 0 \). So, the graph will have a V-shape that touches the x-axis at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and peaks at \( x = 0 \) with \( f(0) = |\frac{1}{2}| = \frac{1}{2} \). So, it's a V with the vertex at \( (0, \frac{1}{2}) \) and touching the x-axis at \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

Similarly, \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \). Following the same logic, the inner absolute value \( |x| \) is symmetric, subtract \( \frac{1}{4} \), then take absolute value. So, the critical point is at \( |x| = \frac{1}{4} \). So, the graph of \( g(x) \) will have a V-shape with the vertex at \( (0, \frac{1}{4}) \) and touching the x-axis at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \).

Okay, so both \( f \) and \( g \) are V-shaped functions with their vertices at \( (0, \frac{1}{2}) \) and \( (0, \frac{1}{4}) \) respectively, and they touch the x-axis at \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \pm \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, moving on to the functions \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). These are compositions of these functions, so I need to figure out how they behave.

Let me first analyze \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \). Let's break it down:

1. Start with \( \sin(2\pi x) \). The sine function has a period of \( 1 \) because the argument is \( 2\pi x \), so the period is \( \frac{2\pi}{2\pi} = 1 \). So, it's a sine wave that completes one full cycle from 0 to 1 on the x-axis.

2. Then, apply \( f \) to this sine function: \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = ||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}| \). Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, taking the absolute value first gives us \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \) which oscillates between 0 and 1. Then subtracting \( \frac{1}{2} \) shifts it down by 0.5, so the expression inside the absolute value becomes \( |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \). This will oscillate between -0.5 and 0.5. Taking the absolute value of that gives us \( ||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}| \), which will oscillate between 0 and 0.5.

3. Then, apply \( g \) to this result: \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = ||f(\sin(2\pi x))| - \frac{1}{4}| \). Wait, but \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is already non-negative because it's an absolute value. So, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4}| \). Since \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is between 0 and 0.5, subtracting \( \frac{1}{4} \) will give us a range from -0.25 to 0.25. Taking the absolute value, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will be between 0 and 0.25.

4. Finally, multiply by 4: \( 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will scale this up to a range between 0 and 1. So, the function \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) oscillates between 0 and 1.

Similarly, let's analyze \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):

1. Start with \( \cos(3\pi y) \). The cosine function has a period of \( \frac{2\pi}{3\pi} = \frac{2}{3} \). So, it's a cosine wave that completes one full cycle every \( \frac{2}{3} \) units on the y-axis.

2. Apply \( f \) to this cosine function: \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = ||\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2}| \). The cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, so \( |\cos(3\pi y)| \) oscillates between 0 and 1. Subtracting \( \frac{1}{2} \) gives a range from -0.5 to 0.5, and taking the absolute value results in \( ||\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2}| \) oscillating between 0 and 0.5.

3. Apply \( g \) to this result: \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = |f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4}| \). Since \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) is between 0 and 0.5, subtracting \( \frac{1}{4} \) gives a range from -0.25 to 0.25, and taking absolute value gives between 0 and 0.25.

4. Multiply by 4: \( 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will be between 0 and 1. So, the function \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) also oscillates between 0 and 1.

So, both functions \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) are oscillating between 0 and 1. Now, I need to find the number of intersections between these two graphs.

Since both functions are periodic, I should figure out their periods to understand how often they repeat their patterns. For \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \), the innermost function is \( \sin(2\pi x) \) with period 1. Then, applying \( f \) and \( g \) doesn't change the period because they are absolute value functions which don't affect the period. So, the period of \( y \) as a function of \( x \) is still 1.

Similarly, for \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), the innermost function is \( \cos(3\pi y) \) with period \( \frac{2}{3} \). Applying \( f \) and \( g \) doesn't change the period, so the period of \( x \) as a function of \( y \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

Therefore, the function \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) has a period of 1 in \( x \), and the function \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) has a period of \( \frac{2}{3} \) in \( y \).

To find the number of intersections, I can consider the behavior of these functions over their periods and see how many times they cross each other.

But since one is a function of \( x \) and the other is a function of \( y \), it's a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this.

Perhaps I can consider the equations:

1. \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

I need to find all pairs \( (x, y) \) that satisfy both equations.

This seems like a system of equations where each equation defines a curve in the plane, and I need to find their points of intersection.

Given the periodicity, I can consider the fundamental periods of each function and analyze the intersections within that interval, then multiply by the number of periods in the domain.

But since both functions are bounded between 0 and 1, perhaps I can limit my analysis to the unit square \( [0,1] \times [0,1] \). Because beyond that, the functions repeat their behavior.

So, let me focus on \( x \in [0,1] \) and \( y \in [0,1] \). If I can find the number of intersections in this square, that should give me the total number of intersections because of periodicity.

Now, let me try to understand the behavior of each function within this interval.

Starting with \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):

- \( \sin(2\pi x) \) goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0 as \( x \) goes from 0 to 1.
- Taking absolute value, \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \) goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to 1 to 0.
- Then, subtracting \( \frac{1}{2} \), we get \( |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \), which goes from -0.5 to 0.5 to -0.5 to 0.5 to -0.5.
- Taking absolute value again, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = ||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}| \) will go from 0.5 to 0 to 0.5 to 0 to 0.5 as \( x \) goes from 0 to 1.
- Then, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4}| \). So, when \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is 0.5, subtracting 0.25 gives 0.25, and when it's 0, subtracting 0.25 gives -0.25, whose absolute value is 0.25. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recast this.

Wait, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is 0.5 at \( x = 0, 0.5, 1 \), and 0 at \( x = 0.25, 0.75 \). So, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 0.25| \). So, when \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = 0.5 \), \( g \) becomes 0.25. When \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = 0 \), \( g \) becomes 0.25 as well. So, actually, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) is always 0.25? That can't be right because \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) varies between 0 and 0.5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is a function that goes from 0.5 at x=0, decreases to 0 at x=0.25, increases back to 0.5 at x=0.5, decreases to 0 at x=0.75, and back to 0.5 at x=1.

So, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 0.25| \). So, when \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is 0.5, \( g \) is 0.25. When \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is 0, \( g \) is 0.25. But in between, when \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is 0.25, \( g \) becomes 0. So, the function \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will have a V-shape in each interval where \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is increasing or decreasing.

So, let's plot this mentally:

- From x=0 to x=0.25: \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) decreases from 0.5 to 0. So, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = |f - 0.25| \) will decrease from 0.25 to 0.25? Wait, no. Wait, when f decreases from","[0.250000000000000, '0.25']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. So, I need to check these primes one by one to see if there's an n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start with the smallest prime, which is 2. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 2² = 4. So, n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for different n:

- If n is even, say n = 2k, then n⁴ = (2k)⁴ = 16k⁴, which is 0 mod 4. So, n⁴ + 1 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 0. So, even numbers won't work.
- If n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, then n⁴ = (2k + 1)⁴. Let's compute this modulo 4. (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1 ≡ 1 mod 4. Then, squaring that, (1)² = 1 mod 4. So, n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 4, and n⁴ + 1 ≡ 2 mod 4, which is also not 0.

So, for p = 2, there's no n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 4. Therefore, p cannot be 2.

Next, let's try p = 3. We need to check if there's an n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 9. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers):

- n = 1: 1⁴ = 1 mod 9 → 1 + 1 = 2 mod 9 ≠ 0
- n = 2: 16 mod 9 = 7 → 7 + 1 = 8 mod 9 ≠ 0
- n = 3: 81 mod 9 = 0 → 0 + 1 = 1 mod 9 ≠ 0
- n = 4: 256 mod 9. Let's compute 256 ÷ 9: 9*28=252, so 256 - 252 = 4 → 4 + 1 = 5 mod 9 ≠ 0
- n = 5: 625 mod 9. 625 ÷ 9: 9*69=621, so 625 - 621 = 4 → 4 + 1 = 5 mod 9 ≠ 0
- n = 6: 1296 mod 9 = 0 → 0 + 1 = 1 mod 9 ≠ 0
- n = 7: 7⁴ = 2401. 2401 ÷ 9: 9*266=2394, so 2401 - 2394 = 7 → 7 + 1 = 8 mod 9 ≠ 0
- n = 8: 4096 mod 9. Let's compute 4096 ÷ 9: 9*455=4095, so 4096 - 4095 = 1 → 1 + 1 = 2 mod 9 ≠ 0

So, none of the residues mod 9 give n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 9. Therefore, p = 3 is also not suitable.

Moving on to p = 5. We need to check if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 25. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. Let's compute n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 24 (since mod 25 cycles every 25 numbers). But that's a lot, maybe there's a smarter way.

I remember that in modular arithmetic, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². So, the order of n modulo p² must divide 8. Also, since n⁴ ≡ -1, the order can't be 4 because (-1)² = 1, so the order is 8. Therefore, 8 must divide φ(p²), where φ is Euler's totient function. φ(p²) = p² - p. So, 8 divides p² - p.

Let me compute p² - p for p = 5: 25 - 5 = 20. Does 8 divide 20? 20 ÷ 8 = 2.5, which is not an integer. So, 8 does not divide 20. Therefore, the multiplicative order of n modulo 25 can't be 8, which suggests that there is no solution for p = 5. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. If n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod 25. So, the order of n modulo 25 divides 8. But the multiplicative group modulo 25 has order φ(25) = 20. So, the order of n must divide both 8 and 20. The greatest common divisor of 8 and 20 is 4. So, the order of n must divide 4. But if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25, then the order can't be 4 because n⁴ ≡ -1 ≠ 1. Therefore, there is no such n for p = 5. So, p = 5 is out.

Next prime is p = 7. Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 49. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 49. Again, using the same logic: n⁸ ≡ 1 mod 49, so the order of n modulo 49 divides 8. φ(49) = 42. So, the order must divide gcd(8,42) = 2. Therefore, the order of n modulo 49 is 2. But if the order is 2, then n² ≡ 1 mod 49, so n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 49, which contradicts n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 49. Therefore, no solution for p = 7.

Hmm, moving on to p = 11. Let's see. φ(121) = 110. So, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 121, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod 121. The order of n must divide 8 and 110. gcd(8,110) = 2. So, the order is 2, which again would imply n² ≡ 1 mod 121, so n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 121, which is not -1. So, no solution for p = 11.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Instead of checking each prime, maybe I should recall some number theory. I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² are primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, and certain conditions hold.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if p is an odd prime, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² implies that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. So, first, -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p. For that, the multiplicative order of -1 modulo p must divide (p-1)/4. Wait, maybe that's too vague.

Alternatively, I remember that for primes p ≡ 1 mod 8, -1 is a quartic residue. Let me check. For p ≡ 1 mod 8, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, which is divisible by 8, so there exists an element of order 8, which would be a primitive 8th root of unity. Therefore, -1 is a square of that element, so it's a quartic residue.

Wait, actually, if p ≡ 1 mod 8, then the multiplicative group has order divisible by 8, so there exists an element of order 8, say g. Then, g⁴ would be an element of order 2, which is -1. So, yes, -1 is a quartic residue modulo p if p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, the primes p where -1 is a quartic residue are primes p ≡ 1 mod 8. So, the smallest such prime is 17, since 17 ≡ 1 mod 8. Wait, but 17 is quite big. Wait, 17 is the first prime after 2,3,5,7,11,13. Let me check 13: 13 mod 8 is 5, so not 1. So, 17 is the next.

But wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check p = 17. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17² = 289.

But before that, let me check p = 13. Wait, p = 13: 13 mod 8 is 5, so not 1. So, -1 is not a quartic residue modulo 13. So, p = 17 is the next candidate.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe p = 5: 5 mod 8 is 5, so not 1. p = 13: 5 mod 8. p = 17: 1 mod 8. So, p = 17 is the first prime where -1 is a quartic residue.

But wait, let me check p = 5 again. Maybe even though p ≡ 5 mod 8, -1 is still a quartic residue. Let me compute n⁴ mod 5. The possible residues mod 5 are 0,1,2,3,4.

Compute n⁴ mod 5:

- 1⁴ = 1
- 2⁴ = 16 ≡ 1 mod 5
- 3⁴ = 81 ≡ 1 mod 5
- 4⁴ = 256 ≡ 1 mod 5

So, all non-zero residues to the 4th power are 1 mod 5. So, n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 5, so n⁴ + 1 ≡ 2 mod 5. So, 5 doesn't divide n⁴ +1, except when n is a multiple of 5, but then n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 +1 ≡1 mod 5, which is not 0. So, p =5 is out.

Similarly, for p =13: Let's compute n⁴ mod 13. The residues mod 13 are 0 to 12. Let's compute n⁴ for n from 1 to 12:

- 1⁴ =1
- 2⁴=16≡3
- 3⁴=81≡3
- 4⁴=256≡9
- 5⁴=625≡625-48*13=625-624=1
- 6⁴=1296≡1296-99*13=1296-1287=9
- 7⁴=2401≡2401-184*13=2401-2392=9
- 8⁴=4096≡4096-315*13=4096-4095=1
- 9⁴=6561≡6561-504*13=6561-6552=9
- 10⁴=10000≡10000-769*13=10000-9997=3
- 11⁴=14641≡14641-1126*13=14641-14638=3
- 12⁴=20736≡20736-1595*13=20736-20735=1

So, the quartic residues mod 13 are 1, 3, 9. So, -1 mod 13 is 12. Is 12 a quartic residue mod 13? From above, the quartic residues are 1,3,9. 12 is not among them. So, -1 is not a quartic residue mod 13. Therefore, p=13 is out.

So, moving on to p=17. Let's see if -1 is a quartic residue mod 17. First, compute n⁴ mod 17 for n from 1 to 16.

But that's a bit tedious. Alternatively, since 17 ≡ 1 mod 8, as I thought earlier, -1 is a quartic residue. So, there exists some n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17. Let me find such an n.

Let me try n=2: 2⁴=16≡-1 mod 17. Oh, wow, n=2 works! So, 2⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17. Therefore, 2⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 17. So, 17 divides 2⁴ +1=17. So, 17","[17, '17']",110,"[110, '110']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point I is equidistant from all four faces, which makes me think it's the incenter of the tetrahedron. The distance is supposed to be expressed in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.

First, I need to recall what the incenter of a tetrahedron is. In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, and this distance is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I remember that for a tetrahedron, the formula is similar to the 2D case but extended to three dimensions. In 2D, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, the inradius is 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, the formula should be:

r = 3V / A_total

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and A_total is the sum of the areas of all four faces.

So, my plan is:

1. Find the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD.
2. Find the areas of each of the four faces.
3. Sum the areas to get A_total.
4. Plug into the formula r = 3V / A_total to get the inradius.

But before that, I need to figure out the structure of the tetrahedron. The given edge lengths are:

AB = CD = √41

AC = BD = √80

BC = AD = √89

Hmm, so opposite edges are equal. That suggests that the tetrahedron is ""equifacial"" or maybe ""isohedral,"" but I'm not sure. Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here. But the opposite edges being equal might mean that the tetrahedron is ""equilic,"" meaning that opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons have some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe it's a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, in this case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, so yes, it's a disphenoid. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. That would mean that each face has the same area, so A_total = 4 * area of one face.

That simplifies things because I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.

So, first, let's compute the area of one face. Let's pick face ABC. The sides are AB = √41, BC = √89, and AC = √80.

Wait, hold on. Let me confirm: AB = √41, AC = √80, BC = √89. So, triangle ABC has sides √41, √80, √89.

I can use Heron's formula to compute the area. Heron's formula is:

Area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

where s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, let's compute s for triangle ABC:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

But that seems complicated because of the square roots. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since all four faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron is orthocentric or something? Wait, maybe I can compute the volume using another method.

Wait, another approach: since it's a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) ) / 8

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the lengths of the edges.

Alternatively, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.

Yes, that might be a good approach. Let me try that.

Let me assign coordinates to the vertices such that the calculations are manageable.

Let me set vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Let me set vertex B at (x, 0, 0). Then, vertex C can be at (p, q, 0), and vertex D at (r, s, t). Then, I can use the given edge lengths to set up equations.

But this might get complicated, but let's try.

Let me denote:

A = (0, 0, 0)

B = (a, 0, 0)

C = (b, c, 0)

D = (d, e, f)

Now, compute the distances:

AB = distance between A and B = sqrt( (a)^2 + 0 + 0 ) = a = sqrt(41). So, a = sqrt(41). So, B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).

AC = distance between A and C = sqrt( b^2 + c^2 ) = sqrt(80). So, b^2 + c^2 = 80.

AD = distance between A and D = sqrt( d^2 + e^2 + f^2 ) = sqrt(89). So, d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 89.

BC = distance between B and C = sqrt( (b - sqrt(41))^2 + c^2 ) = sqrt(89). So, (b - sqrt(41))^2 + c^2 = 89.

BD = distance between B and D = sqrt( (d - sqrt(41))^2 + e^2 + f^2 ) = sqrt(80). So, (d - sqrt(41))^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 80.

CD = distance between C and D = sqrt( (d - b)^2 + (e - c)^2 + f^2 ) = sqrt(41). So, (d - b)^2 + (e - c)^2 + f^2 = 41.

So, now I have several equations:

1. b^2 + c^2 = 80

2. (b - sqrt(41))^2 + c^2 = 89

3. d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 89

4. (d - sqrt(41))^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 80

5. (d - b)^2 + (e - c)^2 + f^2 = 41

Let me try to solve these equations step by step.

First, equations 1 and 2 can help me find b.

From equation 1: b^2 + c^2 = 80

From equation 2: (b - sqrt(41))^2 + c^2 = 89

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(b - sqrt(41))^2 + c^2 - (b^2 + c^2) = 89 - 80

Expand (b - sqrt(41))^2: b^2 - 2b sqrt(41) + 41

So, b^2 - 2b sqrt(41) + 41 + c^2 - b^2 - c^2 = 9

Simplify: -2b sqrt(41) + 41 = 9

So, -2b sqrt(41) = 9 - 41 = -32

Divide both sides by -2: b sqrt(41) = 16

Thus, b = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41

So, b = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41

Now, from equation 1: b^2 + c^2 = 80

Compute b^2: (256 * 41) / (41^2) = 256 / 41

So, 256 / 41 + c^2 = 80

Thus, c^2 = 80 - 256 / 41 = (3280 - 256) / 41 = 3024 / 41

So, c = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)

Simplify sqrt(3024):

3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 16 * 9 * 21

So, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)

Thus, c = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(21) sqrt(41)) / 41 = (12 sqrt(861)) / 41

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 3024 divided by 41 is 73.756... Hmm, but 3024 is 16 * 189, which is 16 * 9 * 21, so sqrt(3024) is 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). So, c = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(41):

c = (12 sqrt(21) sqrt(41)) / 41 = 12 sqrt(861) / 41

But 861 factors: 861 ÷ 3 = 287, which is 7 * 41. So, 861 = 3 * 7 * 41, which is square-free. So, c = 12 sqrt(861)/41.

Okay, so c is 12 sqrt(861)/41.

So, now, we have coordinates for C: (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0)

Now, moving on to equations 3, 4, and 5.

Equation 3: d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 89

Equation 4: (d - sqrt(41))^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 80

Subtract equation 4 from equation 3:

d^2 + e^2 + f^2 - [(d - sqrt(41))^2 + e^2 + f^2] = 89 - 80

Simplify:

d^2 - (d^2 - 2d sqrt(41) + 41) = 9

So, d^2 - d^2 + 2d sqrt(41) - 41 = 9

Simplify: 2d sqrt(41) - 41 = 9

So, 2d sqrt(41) = 50

Thus, d = 50 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41) = (25 sqrt(41)) / 41

So, d = 25 sqrt(41)/41

Now, from equation 3: d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 89

Compute d^2: (625 * 41) / (41^2) = 625 / 41

So, 625 / 41 + e^2 + f^2 = 89

Thus, e^2 + f^2 = 89 - 625 / 41 = (3649 - 625) / 41 = 3024 / 41

So, e^2 + f^2 = 3024 / 41

Now, equation 5: (d - b)^2 + (e - c)^2 + f^2 = 41

We have d = 25 sqrt(41)/41, b = 16 sqrt(41)/41

So, d - b = (25 sqrt(41) - 16 sqrt(41))/41 = 9 sqrt(41)/41

Thus, (d - b)^2 = (81 * 41) / (41^2) = 81 / 41

Similarly, e - c = e - (12 sqrt(861)/41)

So, (e - c)^2 = (e - 12 sqrt(861)/41)^2

And f^2 is just f^2.

So, equation 5 becomes:

81/41 + (e - 12 sqrt(861)/41)^2 + f^2 = 41

But from equation 3, we have e^2 + f^2 = 3024 / 41

So, let's write equation 5 as:

81/41 + (e^2 - (24 sqrt(861)/41)e + (144 * 861)/ (41^2)) + f^2 = 41

But e^2 + f^2 = 3024 / 41, so substitute:

81/41 + [3024 / 41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41)e + (144 * 861)/ (41^2)] = 41

Simplify:

81/41 + 3024 / 41 - (24 sqrt(861)/41)e + (144 * 861)/ (41^2) = 41

Combine the constants:

(81 + 3024)/41 + (144 * 861)/(41^2) - (24 sqrt(861)/41)e = 41

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the square of the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me recall that for a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume V is abc. So, in this case, S = 54 and V = 23. So, we have:

2(ab + bc + ac) = 54  
abc = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius r is half of the space diagonal.

The space diagonal d of a box is given by sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So, r = d/2 = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2. Therefore, r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4. So, if I can find a² + b² + c², then I can find r².

So, my goal is to find the minimal possible value of (a² + b² + c²)/4 given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Wait, but actually, since we need the minimal sphere that can contain any box in B, we need the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, right? Because the sphere must contain all such boxes, so the sphere's radius must be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal. So, actually, I need to maximize a² + b² + c² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, no, hold on. The problem says ""the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes."" So, for each box, the sphere must contain it, so the sphere's radius must be at least the maximum of all the space diagonals of the boxes in B. Therefore, to find the minimal such sphere, we need the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, and then take half of that as the radius.

So, in other words, r = (1/2) * max{sqrt(a² + b² + c²)} over all boxes in B. Therefore, r² = (1/4) * max{a² + b² + c²}.

So, I need to maximize a² + b² + c² given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Hmm, okay, so this is an optimization problem with constraints. I can use Lagrange multipliers or maybe some inequalities to find the maximum of a² + b² + c².

Let me think about the relationship between a² + b² + c² and ab + bc + ac. I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, since 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, that means ab + bc + ac = 27. Therefore, (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 54. So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 54.

So, if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)², maybe I can find a way to maximize it.

But I also have the constraint abc = 23. So, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c².

Subject to the constraints:

g(a, b, c) = 2(ab + bc + ac) - 54 = 0  
h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0

So, I can set up the Lagrangian:

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(2(ab + bc + ac) - 54) - μ(abc - 23)

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, set them equal to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂a = 2a - λ(2b + 2c) - μ(bc) = 0  
Similarly, ∂L/∂b = 2b - λ(2a + 2c) - μ(ac) = 0  
∂L/∂c = 2c - λ(2a + 2b) - μ(ab) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

2a - 2λ(b + c) - μ bc = 0  
2b - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0  
2c - 2λ(a + b) - μ ab = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can assume symmetry here? If the maximum occurs when a = b = c, but wait, if a = b = c, then the box is a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If a = b = c, then surface area would be 6a² = 54, so a² = 9, a = 3. Then volume would be 27, but in our case, volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube with surface area 54 has volume 27, but our boxes have volume 23, which is less. So, the box is not a cube, but maybe it's close to a cube? Or maybe it's more elongated.

Alternatively, perhaps two sides are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume that a = b, so the box is a square prism. Let's see if that assumption can lead us somewhere.

Let me set a = b, so we have:

Surface area: 2(a² + 2ac) = 54  
Volume: a² c = 23

So, from surface area: 2a² + 4ac = 54  
Divide both sides by 2: a² + 2ac = 27  
From volume: c = 23 / a²

Substitute c into the surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23 / a²) = 27  
Simplify: a² + (46 / a) = 27  
Multiply both sides by a: a³ + 46 = 27a  
So, a³ - 27a + 46 = 0

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0  
a=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, a=2 is a root.

So, factor out (a - 2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a - 2):

Coefficients: 1, 0, -27, 46

Bring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next term: 0 + 2 = 2. Multiply by 2: 4. Add to -27: -23. Multiply by 2: -46. Add to 46: 0. So, the cubic factors as (a - 2)(a² + 2a -23).

So, the roots are a=2 and roots of a² + 2a -23=0, which are a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6). Since a must be positive, a = -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

So, possible a's are 2 and approximately 3.898.

So, if a=2, then c=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box would be 2x2x5.75.

If a≈3.898, then c=23/(3.898²)≈23/(15.19)≈1.515.

So, the box would be approximately 3.898x3.898x1.515.

Now, let's compute a² + b² + c² for both cases.

First case: a=2, b=2, c=5.75

a² + b² + c² = 4 + 4 + (5.75)² = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625

Second case: a≈3.898, b≈3.898, c≈1.515

a² + b² + c² ≈ 2*(3.898)² + (1.515)² ≈ 2*(15.19) + 2.295 ≈ 30.38 + 2.295 ≈ 32.675

So, clearly, the first case gives a larger a² + b² + c². So, in the case where a=2, b=2, c=5.75, the space diagonal squared is 41.0625, which is larger than the other case.

But wait, is this the maximum? Or is there a box with even larger a² + b² + c²?

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when one side is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, given the constraints.

But how can I be sure? Maybe I need to consider the general case without assuming a = b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers as I started earlier.

So, going back to the system:

2a - 2λ(b + c) - μ bc = 0  
2b - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0  
2c - 2λ(a + b) - μ ab = 0

Let me denote these equations as (1), (2), (3).

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(2b - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac) - (2a - 2λ(b + c) - μ bc) = 0  
Simplify:

2b - 2λa - 2λc - μ ac - 2a + 2λb + 2λc + μ bc = 0  
Simplify terms:

(2b - 2a) + (-2λa + 2λb) + (-μ ac + μ bc) = 0  
Factor:

2(b - a) + 2λ(b - a) + μ c(b - a) = 0  
Factor out (b - a):

(b - a)(2 + 2λ + μ c) = 0

So, either b = a or 2 + 2λ + μ c = 0.

Similarly, subtracting equation (1) from equation (3):

(2c - 2λ(a + b) - μ ab) - (2a - 2λ(b + c) - μ bc) = 0  
Simplify:

2c - 2λa - 2λb - μ ab - 2a + 2λb + 2λc + μ bc = 0  
Simplify terms:

(2c - 2a) + (-2λa + 2λc) + (-μ ab + μ bc) = 0  
Factor:

2(c - a) + 2λ(c - a) + μ b(c - a) = 0  
Factor out (c - a):

(c - a)(2 + 2λ + μ b) = 0

So, either c = a or 2 + 2λ + μ b = 0.

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from equation (3):

(2c - 2λ(a + b) - μ ab) - (2b - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac) = 0  
Simplify:

2c - 2λa - 2λb - μ ab - 2b + 2λa + 2λc + μ ac = 0  
Simplify terms:

(2c - 2b) + (-2λb + 2λc) + (-μ ab + μ ac) = 0  
Factor:

2(c - b) + 2λ(c - b) + μ a(c - b) = 0  
Factor out (c - b):

(c - b)(2 + 2λ + μ a) = 0

So, either c = b or 2 + 2λ + μ a = 0.

So, from these three results, we have:

Either a = b = c, or some other conditions.

Case 1: a = b = c.

But as we saw earlier, if a = b = c, then the volume would be 27, but we have volume 23, so this is not possible. So, a = b = c is not a solution here.

Case 2: Suppose a = b ≠ c.

Then, from the first subtraction, since a = b, the first factor (b - a) is zero, so the other factor is 2 + 2λ + μ c = 0.

Similarly, from the second subtraction, (c - a)(2 + 2λ + μ b) = 0. Since a = b, this becomes (c - a)(2 + 2λ + μ a) = 0.

So, either c = a, which would lead to a = b = c, which we already saw is not possible, or 2 + 2λ + μ a = 0.

But from the first subtraction, we have 2 + 2λ + μ c = 0.

So, 2 + 2λ + μ a = 0 and 2 + 2λ + μ c = 0.

Subtracting these two equations: μ a - μ c = 0 => μ(a - c) = 0.

So, either μ = 0 or a = c.

"Okay, so I have this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use some logarithmic identities to simplify these equations. Let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think I can use the power rule for logarithms, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that to both equations:

For the first equation: log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Okay, so now I have:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I also remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). That might be useful here because I see log_x(y) and log_y(x) in the equations. Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say:

Let’s let a = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) would be 1/a because of the reciprocal property.

So substituting back into the equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y * (1/a) = 10

So now I have two equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. (4y)/a = 10

I can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of a. Let me do that.

From the first equation: x = 10 / a.

From the second equation: 4y = 10a => y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of a. But I need another equation to find the value of a. Wait, I know that a = log_x(y). Let me express that in terms of x and y.

Since a = log_x(y), by definition, this means that x^a = y.

But I already have expressions for x and y in terms of a. So let me substitute those in.

x = 10 / a, so x^a = (10 / a)^a.

And y = (5a)/2.

So, setting them equal: (10 / a)^a = (5a)/2.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier to handle the exponent.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln[(10 / a)^a] = ln[(5a)/2]

Using the power rule for logarithms again, ln(b^c) = c * ln(b):

a * ln(10 / a) = ln(5a / 2)

Let me expand ln(10 / a) as ln(10) - ln(a):

a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] = ln(5a / 2)

Similarly, ln(5a / 2) can be written as ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2):

So, the equation becomes:

a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

Let me distribute the a on the left side:

a * ln(10) - a * ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy, but maybe I can collect like terms. Let me bring all terms to one side:

a * ln(10) - a * ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2) = 0

Factor out ln(a) terms:

a * ln(10) - (a + 1) * ln(a) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I need to make an intelligent guess or see if a is a nice number.

Let me think about possible values of a. Since x and y are both greater than 1, and a = log_x(y), which is positive. Also, from x = 10 / a and y = 5a / 2, both x and y must be greater than 1, so 10 / a > 1 => a < 10, and 5a / 2 > 1 => a > 2/5. So a is between 0.4 and 10.

Maybe a is 2? Let me test a = 2.

Plugging a = 2 into the equation:

Left side: 2 * ln(10) - (2 + 1) * ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Simplify:

2 ln(10) - 3 ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 2 ln(10) - 2 ln(2) - ln(5)

Compute each term:

ln(10) ≈ 2.3026, ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, ln(5) ≈ 1.6094

So:

2 * 2.3026 ≈ 4.6052

2 * 0.6931 ≈ 1.3862

So, 4.6052 - 1.3862 - 1.6094 ≈ 4.6052 - 3.0 ≈ 1.6052, which is not zero. So a = 2 is not a solution.

How about a = 5?

Left side: 5 ln(10) - 6 ln(5) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 5 ln(10) - 7 ln(5) + ln(2)

Compute:

5 * 2.3026 ≈ 11.513

7 * 1.6094 ≈ 11.2658

ln(2) ≈ 0.6931

So, 11.513 - 11.2658 + 0.6931 ≈ 0.9403, which is still not zero.

Hmm, maybe a = 1?

Left side: 1 * ln(10) - 2 ln(1) - ln(5) + ln(2) = ln(10) - 0 - ln(5) + ln(2)

Which is ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) = ln(10/5) + ln(2) = ln(2) + ln(2) = 2 ln(2) ≈ 1.386, not zero.

Hmm, maybe a = 1/2?

Wait, a must be greater than 0.4, so 0.5 is okay.

Left side: 0.5 ln(10) - (0.5 + 1) ln(0.5) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Compute:

0.5 * 2.3026 ≈ 1.1513

1.5 * ln(0.5) ≈ 1.5 * (-0.6931) ≈ -1.0397

So, 1.1513 - (-1.0397) - ln(5) + ln(2) ≈ 1.1513 + 1.0397 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ (1.1513 + 1.0397) = 2.191; (2.191 - 1.6094) = 0.5816; 0.5816 + 0.6931 ≈ 1.2747, not zero.

Hmm, maybe a = 10? But a must be less than 10, but let's see:

Left side: 10 ln(10) - 11 ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) = -ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) ≈ -2.3026 -1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ -3.2189, not zero.

Hmm, maybe a = 4?

Left side: 4 ln(10) - 5 ln(4) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Compute:

4 * 2.3026 ≈ 9.2104

5 * ln(4) ≈ 5 * 1.3863 ≈ 6.9315

So, 9.2104 - 6.9315 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ (9.2104 - 6.9315) = 2.2789; (2.2789 - 1.6094) = 0.6695; 0.6695 + 0.6931 ≈ 1.3626, not zero.

Hmm, maybe a = 3?

Left side: 3 ln(10) - 4 ln(3) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Compute:

3 * 2.3026 ≈ 6.9078

4 * ln(3) ≈ 4 * 1.0986 ≈ 4.3944

So, 6.9078 - 4.3944 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ (6.9078 - 4.3944) = 2.5134; (2.5134 - 1.6094) = 0.904; 0.904 + 0.6931 ≈ 1.5971, still not zero.

Hmm, maybe a = 1. Let me try a = 1 again, but I think I did that earlier.

Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me go back to the equation:

(10 / a)^a = (5a)/2

Let me denote t = a, so the equation is (10 / t)^t = (5t)/2

I can take natural logs again:

t * ln(10 / t) = ln(5t / 2)

Which is the same as:

t (ln(10) - ln(t)) = ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2)

Let me rearrange:

t ln(10) - t ln(t) - ln(5) - ln(t) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

t ln(10) - (t + 1) ln(t) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

This seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I can define a function f(t) = t ln(10) - (t + 1) ln(t) - ln(5) + ln(2) and try to find t where f(t) = 0.

I can try to approximate this numerically. Let me try t = 2:

f(2) = 2 * 2.3026 - 3 * 0.6931 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 4.6052 - 2.0793 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 4.6052 - 3.6887 + 0.6931 ≈ 1.6096, which is positive.

t = 3:

f(3) = 3 * 2.3026 - 4 * 1.0986 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 6.9078 - 4.3944 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 6.9078 - 6.0038 + 0.6931 ≈ 1.5971, still positive.

t = 4:

f(4) = 4 * 2.3026 - 5 * 1.3863 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 9.2104 - 6.9315 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 9.2104 - 8.5409 + 0.6931 ≈ 1.3626, still positive.

t = 5:

f(5) = 5 * 2.3026 - 6 * 1.6094 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 11.513 - 9.6564 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 11.513 - 11.2658 + 0.6931 ≈ 0.9403, still positive.

t = 6:

f(6) = 6 * 2.3026 - 7 * 1.7918 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 13.8156 - 12.5426 - 1.6094 + 0.6931 ≈ 13.8156 - 14.152 + 0.6931 ≈ -0.6433, now negative.

So between t=5 and t=6, f(t) crosses zero. Let me try t=5.5:

f(5.5) = 5.5 * 2.3026 - ","[2.30260000000000, '5.5 * 2.3026 - ']",25,"[25, '25']",False
"Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 chips from a pile. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last chip wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob have a winning strategy, no matter what Alice does. Hmm, interesting.

Let me start by understanding the game mechanics. Each player can remove 1 or 4 chips on their turn. So, the possible moves from any pile size n are n-1 and n-4. The player who takes the last chip wins, so if you can force the other player into a position where they can't win, you can win.

This sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, I need to figure out for each n, whether it's a winning or losing position. If n is a losing position, that means Bob can win if Alice starts at a winning position. Wait, no, actually, since Alice starts, if n is a losing position, then Bob can win because Alice can't force a win from there. So, the number of losing positions n ≤ 2024 will be the answer.

Let me try to find a pattern or recurrence relation for these positions. Let's denote P(n) as true if n is a winning position, and false if it's a losing position.

Base cases:
- P(0): If there are 0 chips, the game is over, so the player to move loses. So, P(0) = false (losing position).
- P(1): The player can take 1 chip and win. So, P(1) = true.
- P(2): The player can take 1 chip, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, if I take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because there are only 2 chips. So, only option is to take 1, which leads to opponent winning. So, P(2) = false? Wait, no, because if I take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So, I can't force a win, so P(2) is a losing position? Wait, but if I have 2 chips, I can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So, I can't win from 2, so P(2) is false.

Wait, let me think again. If n=2, the current player can only take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So, yes, P(2) is a losing position.

Similarly, P(3): The player can take 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, P(3) is true.

P(4): The player can take 4 and win immediately. So, P(4) is true.

P(5): The player can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for the opponent. Alternatively, take 4, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Wait, so both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So, P(5) is false.

Wait, is that right? If I have 5 chips, I can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for the opponent because they can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, I can take 4, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent because they can take 1 and win. So, no matter what I do, the opponent can win. So, P(5) is a losing position.

P(6): Let's see. If I take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, if I take 1, opponent is in a losing position, so I can win. Therefore, P(6) is true.

P(7): If I take 1, leaving 6, which is a winning position for the opponent. If I take 4, leaving 3, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, both options leave the opponent in a winning position. So, P(7) is false.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If I have 7 chips, taking 1 leaves 6, which is a winning position for the opponent. Taking 4 leaves 3, which is also a winning position for the opponent. So, yes, P(7) is a losing position.

P(8): If I take 1, leaving 7, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, I can win by taking 1. Therefore, P(8) is true.

P(9): If I take 1, leaving 8, which is a winning position for the opponent. If I take 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, I can take 4 and leave the opponent in a losing position. Therefore, P(9) is true.

Wait, so P(9) is true because taking 4 leaves 5, which is a losing position.

P(10): If I take 1, leaving 9, which is a winning position for the opponent. If I take 4, leaving 6, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, both options leave the opponent in a winning position. Therefore, P(10) is false.

Hmm, so let's list out the positions we have so far:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
P(n): F T F T T F T F T T F

Wait, let me write them out:

n=0: F
n=1: T
n=2: F
n=3: T
n=4: T
n=5: F
n=6: T
n=7: F
n=8: T
n=9: T
n=10: F

Looking for a pattern here. Let's see the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,...

What's the difference between these? 0,2,5,7,10,...

Differences: 2,3,2,3,...

So, it alternates between adding 2 and 3. So, 0+2=2, 2+3=5, 5+2=7, 7+3=10, 10+2=12, 12+3=15, etc.

So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? Wait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

Wait, 0 mod 5 is 0, 2 mod 5 is 2, 5 mod 5 is 0, 7 mod 5 is 2, 10 mod 5 is 0, 12 mod 5 is 2, 15 mod 5 is 0, 17 mod 5 is 2, etc. So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5.

Wait, let's check:

n=0: 0 mod5=0, losing
n=2: 2 mod5=2, losing
n=5: 5 mod5=0, losing
n=7: 7 mod5=2, losing
n=10:10 mod5=0, losing
n=12:12 mod5=2, losing
n=15:15 mod5=0, losing
n=17:17 mod5=2, losing
Yes, that seems to fit.

So, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, let me test n=12. If n=12, is it a losing position?

If I have 12 chips, can I force a win? Let's see:

If I take 1, leaving 11. Is 11 a winning position? Let's see, 11 mod5=1, which is a winning position. So, opponent can win from 11.

If I take 4, leaving 8. 8 mod5=3, which is a winning position. So, opponent can win from 8.

Therefore, from 12, any move I make leaves the opponent in a winning position. So, 12 is a losing position. So, yes, n=12 is losing.

Similarly, n=15: If I take 1, leaving 14 (14 mod5=4, which is winning). If I take 4, leaving 11 (11 mod5=1, which is winning). So, yes, 15 is losing.

So, the pattern seems to hold. Therefore, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, for n ≤2024, the number of losing positions is the number of integers ≤2024 that are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5? That's floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5*404=2020). Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: starting from 2,7,12,..., up to ≤2024.

What's the largest number ≤2024 that is ≡2 mod5? 2024 divided by5: 2024=5*404 +4, so 2024≡4 mod5. So, the largest number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024 is 2024 - (4-2)=2022. So, 2022=5*404 +2.

So, the numbers ≡2 mod5 are 2,7,12,...,2022. How many terms? The sequence is 2 +5k where k=0,1,...,m. 2+5m ≤2024. 5m ≤2022, so m=404.4, so m=404. So, 405 terms (from k=0 to k=404).

Wait, wait, 2 +5*404=2+2020=2022, which is correct. So, the number of terms is 405.

Similarly, numbers ≡0 mod5: 0,5,10,...,2020. How many? 2020/5=404, so 405 terms (including 0). But wait, n is positive integers, so n=0 is not counted. So, numbers ≡0 mod5 from 5 to2020: 404 numbers.

Wait, hold on. The problem says ""números positivos menores ou iguais a 2024"", so positive integers ≤2024. So, n starts at 1.

So, for ≡0 mod5: n=5,10,...,2020. Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

For ≡2 mod5: n=2,7,12,...,2022. Number of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So, total losing positions: 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me confirm:

Numbers ≡0 mod5: 5,10,...,2020. Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7,...,2022. Number of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

Total:404+405=809.

But wait, n=0 is not included because n must be positive. So, yes, 809 is the total number of losing positions.

Therefore, the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial terms to make sure the pattern holds.

n=0: losing (but not counted)
n=1: winning
n=2: losing
n=3: winning
n=4: winning
n=5: losing
n=6: winning
n=7: losing
n=8: winning
n=9: winning
n=10: losing
n=11: winning
n=12: losing
n=13: winning
n=14: winning
n=15: losing
Yes, the pattern is consistent: every 5 numbers, positions 0 and 2 are losing, others are winning.

So, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5, and the count is 404 +405=809.

Therefore, the answer is 809.

**Final Answer**
The number of integers is \boxed{809}.
</think>

To determine the number of integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions in the game. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

We start by analyzing the game mechanics and identifying the winning and losing positions. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - \( P(0) \) is a losing position (False).
   - \( P(1) \) is a winning position (True).
   - \( P(2) \) is a losing position (False).
   - \( P(3) \) is a winning position (True).
   - \( P(4) \) is a winning position (True).
   - \( P(5) \) is a losing position (False).

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - By examining the positions, we find that the losing positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) and \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Counting Losing Positions**:
   - For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \): The numbers are 5, 10, 15, ..., 202","[809, '809']",809,"[809, '809']",True
"Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen participating in a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, Jen chooses 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the big prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the big prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the big prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the big prize automatically means she has won a prize, A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to find P(A), the probability of winning the big prize, and P(B), the probability of winning at least a prize (i.e., at least two numbers matching). Then, divide P(A) by P(B) to get the conditional probability.

Let me start by calculating P(A). The big prize is when all four of her numbers are chosen. Since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers out of 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the big prize is just 1, because there's only one specific set of four numbers that she has chosen. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, moving on to P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This is a bit trickier because it's the probability of having 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. Instead of calculating each of these probabilities separately and adding them up, it might be easier to calculate the complement and subtract it from 1.

The complement of winning at least two numbers is winning fewer than two numbers, which means winning 0 or 1 number. So, P(B) = 1 - P(0 or 1 numbers matching).

Let me compute P(0 numbers matching) and P(1 number matching).

First, P(0 numbers matching): This is the probability that none of her four numbers are chosen. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6) is C(6,4). So, P(0) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Calculating C(6,4): 6! / (4! * 2!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15. So, P(0) = 15 / 210.

Next, P(1 number matching): This is the probability that exactly one of her numbers is chosen. The number of ways to choose 1 number from her 4 and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 is C(4,1) * C(6,3). So, P(1) = [C(4,1) * C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Calculating C(4,1) = 4, and C(6,3) = 20. So, P(1) = (4 * 20) / 210 = 80 / 210.

Therefore, P(0 or 1) = P(0) + P(1) = 15/210 + 80/210 = 95/210.

So, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me double-check that. 210 - 95 is 115, so yes, 115/210. Simplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 ÷ 5 = 23, 210 ÷ 5 = 42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, hold on, 115 divided by 5 is 23, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, yes, 23/42.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating P(0) and P(1). So, P(0) is C(6,4)/C(10,4) = 15/210. P(1) is C(4,1)*C(6,3)/C(10,4) = 4*20 / 210 = 80/210. So, 15 + 80 = 95, so 95/210 is correct. Then, 210 - 95 = 115, so 115/210 simplifies to 23/42. That seems right.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

Earlier, we found P(A) = 1/210.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Dividing fractions: (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42)/(4830).

Simplify 42/4830: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 42. 42 ÷ 42 = 1, 4830 ÷ 42 = 115. So, 1/115.

Wait, 42 ÷ 42 is 1, and 4830 ÷ 42: Let me compute 42*115: 42*100=4200, 42*15=630, so 4200+630=4830. Yes, correct. So, 42/4830 = 1/115.

So, P(A|B) = 1/115.

Wait, but 1 and 115 are coprime, right? 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 has no common factors with either. So, m = 1, n = 115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, P(A) is 1/210, P(B) is 23/42. So, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42)/(4830). Simplify numerator and denominator by 42: 42 ÷ 42 = 1, 4830 ÷ 42 = 115. So, 1/115. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The number of possible winning combinations where she has at least two numbers is 115, as we saw earlier (since 115/210 is P(B)). The number of combinations where she has all four numbers is 1. So, the conditional probability is 1/115. That makes sense.

Wait, but let me think again. The total number of possible outcomes is 210. The number of favorable outcomes for B is 115, and the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1. So, the conditional probability is 1/115. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using combinations. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with at least two matching is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Let me compute that.

C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, total favorable for B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, that's 115/210, which is 23/42. So, that's consistent with earlier.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but 115 is 5*23, and 1 is coprime with both, so yes, 1 and 115 are coprime.

So, the answer is 116.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, using hypergeometric distribution. The probability of exactly k successes (matches) in n draws without replacement. Here, n = 4, population size N = 10, number of success states K = 4.

The probability of exactly k matches is C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k) / C(N, n).

So, for k = 2, 3, 4, we have:

P(k=2) = C(4,2)*C(6,2)/C(10,4) = 6*15/210 = 90/210.

P(k=3) = C(4,3)*C(6,1)/C(10,4) = 4*6/210 = 24/210.

P(k=4) = C(4,4)*C(6,0)/C(10,4) = 1*1/210 = 1/210.

So, P(B) = P(k=2) + P(k=3) + P(k=4) = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115/210 = 23/42.

So, same result as before.

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(k=4)/P(B) = (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23) = 1/115.

So, same answer.

Therefore, I think 116 is the correct answer.

Jen participa de uma loteria escolhendo 4 números distintos de \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). Quatro números são escolhidos aleatoriamente de \( S \). Ela ganha um prêmio se pelo menos dois de seus números forem dois dos números escolhidos aleatoriamente, e ganha o grande prêmio se todos os quatro de seus números forem os números escolhidos aleatoriamente. A probabilidade de ela ganhar o grande prêmio dado que ganhou um prêmio é \(\frac{m}{n}\) onde \( m \) e \( n \) são inteiros positivos primos entre si. Encontre \( m + n \).

Primeiro, calculamos a probabilidade de Jen ganhar o grande prêmio, \( P(A) \). O número total de combinações possíveis é \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). A probabilidade de ganhar o grande prêmio é \( \frac{1}{210} \).

Em seguida, calculamos a probabilidade de Jen ganhar pelo menos um prêmio, \( P(B) \). Isso inclui a probabilidade de ter 2, 3 ou 4 números correspondendo. Calculamos o complemento, ou seja, a probabilidade de ter 0 ou 1 número correspondendo.

- A probabilidade de ter 0 números correspondendo é \( \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} \).
- A probabilidade de ter 1 número correspondendo é \( \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{80}{210} \).

Portanto, a probabilidade de ter 0 ou 1 número correspondendo é \( \frac{15}{210} + \frac{80}{210} = \frac{95}{210} \). Assim, a probabilidade de ter pelo menos 2 números correspondendo é \( 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \).

A probabilidade condicional de ganhar o grande prêmio dado que ganhou um prêmio é \( \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115} \).

Portanto, \( m = 1 \) e \( n = 115 \), e \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here with two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are colinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are all on a circle, which suggests that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.

Points D, E, C, F are colinear. So, if I imagine rectangle ABCD, point D is one of its vertices, and point C is the opposite corner. Then, points E and F lie on the line extending from D through C. So, the line D-E-C-F is a straight line.

Also, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. That means quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the four points lie on the circumference of a circle. That might be useful for applying cyclic quadrilateral properties, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees or using power of a point.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Rectangle ABCD has AB = 107, BC = 16. So, if I place point A at the origin (0,0), then point B would be at (107, 0), point C at (107, 16), and point D at (0, 16). Then, rectangle EFGH is somewhere else, but points D, E, C, F are colinear. So, the line D-E-C-F is a straight line. Let me figure out the coordinates of E and F.

Wait, maybe assigning coordinates can help. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place point D at (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (107, 16), because AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, from D(0,0) to C(107,16). Then, points E and F lie on the line DC extended beyond C. So, the line DC has a slope of (16 - 0)/(107 - 0) = 16/107. So, the equation of line DC is y = (16/107)x.

Now, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF and FG are adjacent sides, so EF is one side and FG is the other. Since E and F are on line DC, which is the same line as D-E-C-F, then EFGH must be positioned such that E and F are on this line, and G and H are somewhere else.

Wait, but EFGH is a rectangle, so sides EF and FG are perpendicular. Since EF is along the line DC, which has a slope of 16/107, then FG must be perpendicular to that. The slope of FG would be the negative reciprocal, which is -107/16.

But wait, EF is along DC, which is from D(0,0) to C(107,16). So, if E and F are on this line, then EF is a segment on this line. But EF is given as 184, which is longer than DC, which is sqrt(107² + 16²). Let me calculate that: 107² is 11449, 16² is 256, so sqrt(11449 + 256) = sqrt(11705) ≈ 108.18. So, EF is 184, which is longer than DC, so E and F must be beyond C on the line DC.

So, starting from D(0,0), going through C(107,16), and extending to E and F beyond C. Let me denote E as a point beyond C, so E is between C and F, or F is beyond E? Wait, the order is D, E, C, F colinear. So, starting from D, then E, then C, then F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Wait, that might not make sense because EF is 184, which is longer than DC. If E is between D and C, then F would have to be beyond C, but the distance from E to F would be 184. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe E is beyond D, and F is beyond C. But the problem says D, E, C, F are colinear, so the order is D, E, C, F. So, starting from D, then E, then C, then F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

But then, the length of EF would be the distance from E to F, which is beyond C. So, if E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, then EF would be EC + CF. But EF is given as 184, which is longer than DC, which is about 108.18. So, EC + CF = 184. But EC is part of DC, which is 108.18, so CF would be 184 - EC. Hmm, but I don't know EC yet.

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates to E and F. Let me denote E as a point on DC beyond D, but wait, the order is D, E, C, F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Wait, no, if the order is D, E, C, F, then E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So, E is closer to D than C is, and F is beyond C.

So, let me parameterize the line DC. Let me consider DC as a vector from D(0,0) to C(107,16). So, the parametric equations are x = 107t, y = 16t, where t=0 is D, t=1 is C. Then, E is somewhere between D and C, so t is between 0 and 1, and F is beyond C, so t > 1.

Let me denote E as (107t, 16t) where 0 < t < 1, and F as (107s, 16s) where s > 1.

Now, the distance between E and F is EF = 184. So, the distance between (107t, 16t) and (107s, 16s) is sqrt[(107(s - t))² + (16(s - t))²] = (s - t) * sqrt(107² + 16²) = (s - t) * sqrt(11705). This is equal to 184.

So, (s - t) * sqrt(11705) = 184. Therefore, s - t = 184 / sqrt(11705). Let me compute that: sqrt(11705) is approximately 108.18, so 184 / 108.18 ≈ 1.701. So, s = t + 1.701.

But s must be greater than 1 because F is beyond C. So, t + 1.701 > 1, which implies t > -0.701, which is always true since t is between 0 and 1.

Now, since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are perpendicular. So, the vector from E to F is (107(s - t), 16(s - t)), and the vector from F to G should be perpendicular to that. The slope of EF is 16/107, so the slope of FG should be -107/16.

But FG is a side of the rectangle, so its length is 17. So, the vector from F to G has length 17 and slope -107/16. Let me denote G as (107s + a, 16s + b), where a and b satisfy (a, b) is perpendicular to (107,16), so 107a + 16b = 0, and sqrt(a² + b²) = 17.

Wait, actually, since FG is perpendicular to EF, and EF has direction (107,16), then FG must have direction (-16,107) or (16,-107). Because the dot product should be zero: 107*(-16) + 16*107 = -1712 + 1712 = 0. So, the direction vector for FG is either (-16,107) or (16,-107). Since FG is a side of the rectangle, and EFGH is a rectangle, the direction depends on the orientation.

But since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is along DC, which is going from D to C, then FG should be going either upwards or downwards from F. Given that the slope is negative reciprocal, it's either upwards or downwards. Let me assume it's upwards, so the direction is (-16,107). But let's check.

Wait, the slope of FG is -107/16, so if we move from F in the direction of FG, which has slope -107/16, that would mean going down 107 and right 16, or up 107 and left 16. Hmm, but since EFGH is a rectangle, and E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, then G should be above the line DC, so the direction would be upwards. So, the vector from F to G is proportional to (-16,107). Let me confirm.

Wait, the direction vector for FG should be perpendicular to EF. Since EF is in the direction (107,16), then FG is in the direction (-16,107) or (16,-107). Let me take (-16,107) because that would place G above the line DC, which seems more likely.

So, the vector from F to G is k*(-16,107), where k is a scalar. The length of FG is 17, so sqrt[(-16k)² + (107k)²] = 17. So, sqrt[(256k²) + (11449k²)] = sqrt(11705k²) = k*sqrt(11705) = 17. Therefore, k = 17 / sqrt(11705). Let me compute that: 17 / 108.18 ≈ 0.157.

So, the vector from F to G is (-16*(17/sqrt(11705)), 107*(17/sqrt(11705))). Therefore, the coordinates of G are:

G_x = F_x - 16*(17/sqrt(11705)) = 107s - (272)/sqrt(11705)

G_y = F_y + 107*(17/sqrt(11705)) = 16s + (1819)/sqrt(11705)

Similarly, since EFGH is a rectangle, the vector from G to H should be equal and opposite to the vector from E to F. So, vector GH = vector EF. Wait, no, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, vector FG is perpendicular to vector EF, and vector GH is equal to vector EF.

Wait, maybe it's better to find point H. Since EFGH is a rectangle, H can be found by moving from G in the direction opposite to EF. So, vector GH = -vector EF. Vector EF is (107(s - t), 16(s - t)). So, vector GH is (-107(s - t), -16(s - t)). Therefore, point H is G + vector GH.

So, H_x = G_x - 107(s - t)

H_y = G_y - 16(s - t)

But we also know that points A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Therefore, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, we can use the cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Given that, let me write down the coordinates of all points:

- A: (0,0) [since I placed D at (0,0), but wait, earlier I considered A at (0,0), but then D was at (0,16). Wait, I need to clarify the coordinate system.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reassign the coordinates properly.

Let me place point D at (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB = 107, BC = 16, then:

- Point D: (0,0)
- Point C: (107,16)
- Point B: (107,0)
- Point A: (0,16)

Wait, no, that can't be because AB is 107. If A is at (0,16), B would be at (107,16), but then AB would be 107 units long, which is correct. BC would be from (107,16) to (107,0), which is 16 units, correct. CD is from (107,0) to (0,0), which is 107 units, correct. DA is from (0,0) to (0,16), which is 16 units, correct. So, that's the correct coordinate system.

So, points:

- A: (0,16)
- B: (107,16)
- C: (107,0)
- D: (0,0)

Wait, that makes more sense. So, line DC is from D(0,0) to C(1","[16, '16']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an 8x8 grid. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I know that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the bottom-left to the top-right corner requires moving 7 steps to the right and 7 steps up, right? Because each move from one intersection to another is a step, and there are 8 squares along each side, meaning 7 steps. So, in total, the path has 14 steps, but the problem says the path length is 16. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, hold on. If it's an 8x8 grid, that means there are 9 horizontal lines and 9 vertical lines, right? So, moving from the bottom-left to the top-right would require moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Oh, okay, that makes sense now. So, the path length is 16 because it's moving 8 right and 8 up. Got it.

So, normally, without any restrictions, the number of such paths would be the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But here, we have a restriction: the path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, so I need to count the number of such paths with exactly four direction changes.

Let me think about what a direction change means. Each time the path changes from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, starting from the bottom-left, the first move can be either right or up. Then, each subsequent move can either continue in the same direction or switch. Each switch counts as a direction change.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, that means it has five segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, if it starts by moving right, then up, then right, then up, then right, that's four direction changes, resulting in five segments: right, up, right, up, right.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, moving from bottom-left to top-right, you have to make 8 right moves and 8 up moves. So, if you have five segments, that means you have to partition the 8 right moves into some number of segments and the 8 up moves into the remaining segments.

But since direction changes happen between segments, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. So, if we have five segments, that would mean four direction changes. That makes sense.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition the 8 right moves into k segments and the 8 up moves into (5 - k) segments, where k can vary. Wait, no, actually, since the path alternates between right and up moves, the number of right segments and up segments must differ by at most one.

Wait, let me think again. If the path starts with a right move, then the number of right segments and up segments can be equal or differ by one. Similarly, if it starts with an up move.

But since we have five segments in total, which is an odd number, the number of right segments and up segments must differ by one. So, if the path starts with a right move, it will have three right segments and two up segments, or if it starts with an up move, it will have three up segments and two right segments.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the number of direction changes is four, then the number of segments is five. So, if the path starts with a right move, the segments alternate between right and up. So, the number of right segments would be three and the number of up segments would be two, because starting with right, the sequence would be right, up, right, up, right. That's three right segments and two up segments.

Similarly, if the path starts with an up move, it would have three up segments and two right segments.

So, in total, there are two cases: starting with right or starting with up. Each case will contribute a certain number of paths, and we can sum them up.

So, let's formalize this. Let's denote:

- Case 1: The path starts with a right move. Then, it has three right segments and two up segments.

- Case 2: The path starts with an up move. Then, it has three up segments and two right segments.

For each case, we need to compute the number of ways to partition the 8 right moves into three segments and the 8 up moves into two segments, or vice versa.

Wait, no. In Case 1, starting with right, we have three right segments and two up segments. So, the 8 right moves are divided into three segments, each segment having at least one right move, and the 8 up moves are divided into two segments, each segment having at least one up move.

Similarly, in Case 2, starting with up, we have three up segments and two right segments, so 8 up moves divided into three segments and 8 right moves divided into two segments.

So, the number of ways to partition 8 right moves into three segments is equal to the number of compositions of 8 into three positive integers. Similarly, the number of compositions of 8 into two positive integers.

I remember that the number of compositions of n into k positive integers is C(n-1, k-1). So, for 8 right moves into three segments, it's C(7,2). Similarly, 8 up moves into two segments is C(7,1).

Similarly, for Case 2, 8 up moves into three segments is C(7,2), and 8 right moves into two segments is C(7,1).

So, putting it all together:

Case 1: Starting with right.

Number of ways = C(7,2) * C(7,1)

Case 2: Starting with up.

Number of ways = C(7,2) * C(7,1)

So, total number of paths = 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1)

Wait, let me compute that.

C(7,2) is 21, and C(7,1) is 7. So, 21 * 7 = 147. Then, multiplied by 2, that's 294.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because in each case, the number of compositions is multiplied, but we also have to consider the order of the segments.

Wait, no, actually, the compositions already account for the order. For example, partitioning 8 right moves into three segments is the number of ways to place two dividers among the 7 gaps between the 8 moves, which is C(7,2). Similarly for the up moves.

So, yes, the number of ways for each case is C(7,2) * C(7,1). Since there are two cases (starting with right or up), we multiply by 2.

So, total number of paths is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 2 * 21 * 7 = 294.

Wait, but let me verify this with a smaller grid to see if the logic holds.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid, so moving from bottom-left to top-right requires 2 right and 2 up moves, total 4 steps. Let's say we want paths that change direction exactly twice.

Following the same logic, number of direction changes is 2, so number of segments is 3.

Case 1: Starting with right, so segments: right, up, right. So, partition 2 right moves into 2 segments and 2 up moves into 1 segment.

Wait, no. Wait, in a 2x2 grid, moving from bottom-left to top-right is 2 right and 2 up moves. If we have 3 segments, starting with right, the segments would be right, up, right. So, right moves are split into two segments, each at least 1, and up moves into one segment.

Wait, but 2 right moves into two segments: that's C(1,1) = 1 way. And 2 up moves into one segment: only 1 way. So, total for Case 1: 1 * 1 = 1.

Similarly, Case 2: starting with up, segments: up, right, up. So, 2 up moves into two segments: C(1,1) = 1, and 2 right moves into one segment: 1. So, total for Case 2: 1 * 1 = 1.

Total paths: 2.

But let's count manually. In a 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly two direction changes.

Each path must have three segments. So, starting right, then up, then right. So, the path would be right, up, right. But in a 2x2 grid, that would be R, U, R. But wait, that's only 3 moves, but we need 4 moves. Hmm, maybe my analogy is off.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, moving from (0,0) to (2,2). So, you need 2 right and 2 up moves. A path that changes direction exactly twice would have three segments. For example:

R, U, R, U: that's two direction changes, right? Wait, no. Wait, each time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.

So, R, U, R, U: direction changes at step 1 (R to U), step 2 (U to R), step 3 (R to U). So, three direction changes. Wait, but we wanted exactly two direction changes.

Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think again.

Wait, in a path, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times you switch from R to U or U to R. So, for a path like R, R, U, U: that's one direction change. Similarly, R, U, U, R: that's two direction changes.

Wait, so in a 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly two direction changes would be the number of paths that switch direction twice.

So, let's list all possible paths:

1. R, R, U, U: direction changes = 1
2. R, U, R, U: direction changes = 3
3. R, U, U, R: direction changes = 2
4. U, U, R, R: direction changes = 1
5. U, R, U, R: direction changes = 3
6. U, R, R, U: direction changes = 2

So, out of 6 paths, how many have exactly two direction changes? Paths 3 and 6. So, two paths.

But according to my earlier formula, for a 2x2 grid, n=2, direction changes=2, which would correspond to segments=3.

So, applying the same logic:

Case 1: Starting with R, segments: R, U, R. So, partition 2 R into 2 segments: C(1,1)=1, and 2 U into 1 segment: C(1,0)=1? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, starting with R, we have three segments: R, U, R. So, R moves are split into two segments, each at least 1, so C(1,1)=1. U moves are split into one segment, which is just 2, so 1 way. So, total for Case 1: 1*1=1.

Similarly, starting with U, segments: U, R, U. So, U moves split into two segments: C(1,1)=1, R moves split into one segment: 1. So, total for Case 2: 1*1=1.

Total paths: 2, which matches the manual count. So, the formula works for the 2x2 grid.

Therefore, going back to the original problem, the formula should be correct.

So, for the 8x8 grid, the number of paths is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 2 * 21 * 7 = 294.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem?

Alternatively, we can model the path as a sequence of moves, with exactly four direction changes. Each direction change alternates the direction. So, starting with R or U, then alternating.

So, the number of direction changes is four, which means the number of runs (consecutive same direction moves) is five.

Each run must have at least one move. So, for the right moves, if starting with R, we have three runs of R and two runs of U. Each run of R must have at least one R, and each run of U must have at least one U.

Similarly, if starting with U, we have three runs of U and two runs of R.

So, the number of ways to split 8 R's into three runs is C(7,2), and 8 U's into two runs is C(7,1). Similarly, for starting with U, it's C(7,2) for U's and C(7,1) for R's.

So, total number of paths is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 2 * 21 * 7 = 294.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Wait, but let me think about another way. Maybe using recursion or something else.

Alternatively, think of the path as a sequence of moves, with exactly four direction changes. So, the path can be represented as a sequence of R's and U's, with exactly four switches between R and U.

Each switch increases the direction change count by one.

So, starting with R, the sequence would be R...R U...U R...R U...U R...R, which is five runs: three R's and two U's.

Similarly, starting with U, it's U...U R...R U...U R...R U...U, which is five runs: three U's and two R's.

So, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of ways to partition the R's and U's into the respective runs.

For starting with R: number of ways = C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, starting with U: same number, 147.

Total: 147 + 147 = 294.

Yes, that's the same result.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the concept of ""runs"" in combinatorics. The number of ways to arrange the runs is determined by the number of compositions.

So, for starting with R, we have three","[294, '294']",294,"[294, '294']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that \(z\) is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, I can represent \(z\) in polar form. That might make things easier. Let me write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). That way, I can express everything in terms of \(\theta\) and then maybe take the derivative to find the maximum.

So, substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, I get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So, the entire expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me compute each part separately.

First, let me compute \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\). Let's denote \(A = 75 + 117i\), so this term is \(4A e^{i\theta}\). Similarly, the second term is \(B e^{-i\theta}\), where \(B = 24 + 36i\).

So, the expression is \(4A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta}\). To find the real part, I can use Euler's formula: \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\).

Let me compute each term:

First term: \(4A e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\)

Let me compute this multiplication:

\(4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + i4(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)\)

Similarly, the second term: \(B e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)\)

Multiplying this out:

\(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)\)

So, combining both terms, the entire expression is:

Real part: \(4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Imaginary part: \(4(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)\)

But since we're only interested in the real part, let's focus on that:

Real part = \(4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Let me compute this:

First, expand the 4:

\(4*75\cos\theta = 300\cos\theta\)

\(4*(-117\sin\theta) = -468\sin\theta\)

Then, add the other terms:

24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta

So, combining all together:

Real part = \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Combine like terms:

For \(\cos\theta\): 300 + 24 = 324

For \(\sin\theta\): -468 + 36 = -432

So, Real part = \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\)

Hmm, okay, so the real part is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to \(\theta\).

I remember that an expression of the form \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) can be rewritten as \(R\cos(\theta - \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) and \(\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\). The maximum value of this expression is \(R\), since the maximum of cosine is 1.

So, in this case, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\). Let me compute \(R\):

\(R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\)

Compute 324 squared: 324*324. Let me compute that:

324*300 = 97,200

324*24 = 7,776

So, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976

Similarly, 432 squared: 432*432. Let me compute that:

400*400 = 160,000

400*32 = 12,800

32*400 = 12,800

32*32 = 1,024

Wait, that's not the right way. Let me compute 432*432:

Compute 400*400 = 160,000

400*32 = 12,800

32*400 = 12,800

32*32 = 1,024

Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, 432*432 is (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, 324^2 = 104,976 and 432^2 = 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600)

Compute sqrt(291,600). Let me see, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, starting from the real part: 324cosθ - 432sinθ. Then, R = sqrt(324² + 432²). 324 is 18*18, 432 is 18*24. So, 324 = 18*18, 432 = 18*24. So, R = 18*sqrt(18² + 24²) = 18*sqrt(324 + 576) = 18*sqrt(900) = 18*30 = 540. Yep, that's correct.

So, the maximum real part is 540. Therefore, the answer should be 540.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that I made a mistake in the initial expansion?

Let me go back to the expression:

Real part = 324cosθ - 432sinθ.

Yes, that's correct. 4*(75 + 117i) is 300 + 468i, but wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, when I multiplied 4*(75 + 117i), I think I might have messed up the signs.

Wait, no, let me check:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i. Then, when multiplied by e^{iθ}, which is cosθ + i sinθ, so:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ

But i² is -1, so that becomes:

300cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ

Again, i² is -1, so:

24cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)

So, adding the real parts:

300cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24cosθ + 36 sinθ = (300 + 24)cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324cosθ - 432 sinθ

Yes, that's correct. So, the real part is indeed 324cosθ - 432 sinθ, which has a maximum of 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another approach. Maybe using vectors or something else.

Alternatively, since z is on the circle with radius 4, we can think of the expression as a function on the circle and find its maximum real part.

But I think the approach I took is solid. Expressing z in polar form, expanding, computing the real part, and then using the amplitude formula for sinusoidal functions.

So, I think 540 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The maximum real part is \boxed{540}.
</think>

To find the maximum real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term:
- The first term becomes \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\).
- The second term becomes \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\).

Using Euler's formula, we express these terms in terms of \(\cos\theta\) and \(\sin\theta\):
- The first term: \(4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\) results in \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)\).
- The second term: \((24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)\) results in \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)\).

Combining the real parts of both terms:
\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]

Simplifying the real part:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To find the maximum value of this expression, we use the amplitude form \(R\cos(\theta - \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) for \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\):
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the maximum real part is \(\boxed{540}\).","[540, '540']",540,"[540, '540']",True
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a triangle ABC with some circles inside it. Let me try to parse it step by step.

First, the problem says: ""Oito círculos de raio 34 são sequencialmente tangentes, e dois dos círculos são tangentes a AB e BC do triângulo ABC, respectivamente."" Hmm, okay, so that's Portuguese. Let me translate it: ""Eight circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC of triangle ABC, respectively."" So, there are eight circles, each with radius 34, arranged in a sequence where each is tangent to the next. Two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of triangle ABC.

Then it says: ""2024 círculos de raio 1 podem ser dispostos da mesma maneira."" Translating that: ""2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same way."" So, similarly, 2024 circles of radius 1 are arranged sequentially tangent, with two of them tangent to AB and BC.

The question is asking for the inradius of triangle ABC, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then to find m + n.

Alright, so I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC given these two configurations of circles.

Let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC, with sides AB and BC. There are eight circles of radius 34 arranged sequentially, each tangent to the next, with two of them tangent to AB and BC. Similarly, 2024 circles of radius 1 are arranged the same way.

I think this is a problem involving circles packed along the angle bisector of angle B, since two circles are tangent to AB and BC, which are two sides meeting at B. So, the circles are probably arranged along the angle bisector, each tangent to the previous one and also tangent to the two sides AB and BC.

Wait, but if two circles are tangent to AB and BC, that suggests that each of these two circles is tangent to both sides, so they are incircles or something similar. But since there are eight circles, maybe it's a chain of circles tangent to each other and to the two sides.

This seems similar to the problem of circles packed in a right angle, each tangent to the two sides and the previous circle. In such cases, the radii of the circles form a geometric progression.

Let me recall that in a right angle, if you have circles tangent to both sides and each other, the radii decrease by a constant ratio each time. The formula for the radius of the nth circle is r_n = r_1 * k^{n-1}, where k is the common ratio.

But in this case, the triangle isn't necessarily right-angled, but the two sides AB and BC meet at B, so it's an angle, and the circles are arranged along the angle bisector.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the type of triangle, so I might need to find the inradius in terms of the given circles.

Let me think. If there are eight circles of radius 34 arranged sequentially tangent, with two tangent to AB and BC, then the distance from vertex B to the first circle is related to the radius 34. Similarly, for the 2024 circles of radius 1, the distance from B to the first circle is related to radius 1.

But how does this relate to the inradius?

Wait, the inradius is the radius of the incircle, which is tangent to all three sides. So, maybe the inradius is related to the sum of these circles' radii or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the inradius is equal to the sum of the radii of all the circles in one of these configurations.

But wait, in the case of the eight circles, each has radius 34, so the total length along the angle bisector would be 8*34*2, but that might not be directly the inradius.

Wait, no, because each circle is tangent to the next, so the distance between centers is 2*34, but the centers are along the angle bisector.

Wait, maybe the length from B to the first circle is 34 / sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle at B. Similarly, for the 2024 circles, the length from B to the first circle is 1 / sin(theta/2). But since both configurations are in the same triangle, the angle theta is the same, so maybe we can set up a ratio.

Wait, let me think more carefully.

In a triangle, if you have a circle tangent to two sides, its center lies along the angle bisector. The distance from the vertex to the center is d = r / sin(theta/2), where r is the radius of the circle.

So, for the first configuration, with eight circles of radius 34, each subsequent circle is tangent to the previous one, so the distance from B to the first circle's center is d1 = 34 / sin(theta/2). The distance from B to the second circle's center is d2 = d1 + 2*34, because the centers are 2*34 apart (since each has radius 34 and they're tangent). Similarly, the distance to the third circle is d2 + 2*34, and so on, up to the eighth circle.

Wait, but actually, each circle is tangent to the next, so the distance between centers is 2*34, but the direction is along the angle bisector. So, the distance from B to the first circle is 34 / sin(theta/2), then the distance to the second circle is 34 / sin(theta/2) + 2*34, the third is 34 / sin(theta/2) + 4*34, and so on, until the eighth circle.

But wait, actually, each subsequent circle is placed such that it's tangent to the previous one and also tangent to the two sides. So, the distance from B to each circle's center increases by 2*r each time, where r is the radius.

But in this case, all circles have the same radius, 34, so each subsequent center is 2*34 = 68 units further along the angle bisector.

Wait, but if all circles have the same radius, then the distance from B to each center would be d, d + 68, d + 136, etc. But in reality, if the circles are all tangent to the two sides, their centers must lie along the angle bisector, and the distance from B to each center is d = r / sin(theta/2). But if all circles have the same radius, then all centers are at the same distance from B, which is impossible unless they are all coinciding, which they aren't.

Wait, that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the circles don't all have the same radius? But the problem says eight circles of radius 34, so they all have the same radius.

Hmm, that seems contradictory. If all circles have the same radius and are tangent to both sides AB and BC, then their centers must all lie on the angle bisector at the same distance from B, which would mean they all coincide, which isn't the case.

Therefore, perhaps my understanding is incorrect. Maybe the circles are not all tangent to both AB and BC, but only two of them are. The problem says: ""dois dos círculos são tangentes a AB e BC do triângulo ABC, respectivamente."" So, two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC respectively. So, one circle is tangent to AB, another is tangent to BC, and the rest are just sequentially tangent to each other.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, in the configuration, there are eight circles, each tangent to the next, with the first circle tangent to AB and the last circle tangent to BC. So, the chain of circles starts at AB, goes through eight circles, and ends at BC.

Similarly, for the 2024 circles, the chain starts at AB, goes through 2024 circles, and ends at BC.

So, in both cases, the chain of circles is along the angle bisector of angle B, starting at AB, ending at BC, with each circle tangent to the next.

In that case, the length of the angle bisector from AB to BC is equal to the sum of the diameters of all the circles in the chain.

Wait, but the angle bisector length is not just the sum of diameters because the circles are also tangent to the sides AB and BC.

Wait, perhaps the distance from AB to BC along the angle bisector is equal to the sum of the diameters of the circles. But since the circles are tangent to the sides, their centers are offset from the sides by their radii.

Wait, let me think again.

If a circle is tangent to side AB, its center is at a distance of 34 from AB. Similarly, the last circle is tangent to BC, so its center is at a distance of 34 from BC. The centers of the circles lie along the angle bisector, each subsequent center is 2*34 = 68 units apart from the previous one because the circles are tangent.

So, the total distance from the first center to the last center is (8 - 1)*68 = 7*68 = 476 units. But the distance from AB to BC along the angle bisector is equal to the distance from the first center to AB plus the distance from the last center to BC plus the distance between the first and last centers.

Wait, no. The distance from AB to the first center is 34, the distance from the last center to BC is 34, and the distance between the first and last centers is 7*68 = 476. So, the total length of the angle bisector from AB to BC is 34 + 476 + 34 = 544.

Similarly, for the 2024 circles of radius 1, the distance from AB to BC along the angle bisector would be 1 + (2024 - 1)*2*1 + 1 = 1 + 2023*2 + 1 = 1 + 4046 + 1 = 4048.

But wait, the angle bisector length should be the same for both configurations because it's the same triangle ABC. So, 544 = 4048? That can't be. So, something is wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, no, because the angle bisector length is fixed, but in the first case, with radius 34, the length is 544, and in the second case, with radius 1, it's 4048. But 544 ≠ 4048, which is a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angle bisector length isn't just the sum of the radii and the diameters. Maybe it's related to the inradius.

Wait, the inradius is the radius of the incircle, which is tangent to all three sides. The distance from the inradius center to each side is equal to the inradius, r.

But in our case, the circles are arranged along the angle bisector, starting at AB, ending at BC, with each circle tangent to the next. So, the first circle is tangent to AB, the last circle is tangent to BC, and all circles are tangent to each other.

So, the distance from AB to the first center is 34, the distance from the last center to BC is 34, and the distance between the first and last centers is (8 - 1)*2*34 = 476. So, the total length from AB to BC along the angle bisector is 34 + 476 + 34 = 544.

Similarly, for the 2024 circles, the total length is 1 + (2024 - 1)*2*1 + 1 = 4048.

But since both configurations are in the same triangle, the length from AB to BC along the angle bisector must be the same. Therefore, 544 = 4048, which is impossible. So, my reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the angle bisector length isn't directly the sum of these distances because the angle at B affects the actual length.

Wait, the distance from AB to the center of the first circle is 34 / sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle at B. Similarly, the distance from the last circle to BC is 34 / sin(theta/2). The distance between the first and last centers is (8 - 1)*2*34 = 476. So, the total length of the angle bisector from AB to BC is 34 / sin(theta/2) + 476 + 34 / sin(theta/2) = 68 / sin(theta/2) + 476.

Similarly, for the 2024 circles, the total length is 1 / sin(theta/2) + (2024 - 1)*2*1 + 1 / sin(theta/2) = 2 / sin(theta/2) + 4046.

Since both configurations are in the same triangle, the total length must be equal:

68 / sin(theta/2) + 476 = 2 / sin(theta/2) + 4046

Let me write that equation:

68 / sin(theta/2) + 476 = 2 / sin(theta/2) + 4046

Subtract 2 / sin(theta/2) from both sides:

66 / sin(theta/2) + 476 = 4046

Subtract 476 from both sides:

66 / sin(theta/2) = 4046 - 476 = 3570

So,

66 / sin(theta/2) = 3570

Therefore,

sin(theta/2) = 66 / 3570

Simplify 66/3570: divide numerator and denominator by 6: 11/595. 595 divided by 11 is 54.09... Wait, 11*54=594, so 595=11*54 +1, so 11 and 595 are coprime? Let me check: 595 ÷ 5 = 119, 119 ÷ 7 = 17. So, 595 = 5*7*17. 11 is prime, so yes, 11 and 595 are coprime. So, sin(theta/2) = 11/595.

So, sin(theta/2) = 11/595.

Now, we can find cos(theta/2) using the identity sin²x + cos²x = 1.

cos(theta/2) = sqrt","[1, '1']",197,"[197, '197']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, and D on the hyperbola given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombuses. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm that. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's a key property.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A, B, C, D are points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the coordinates of the points must be such that if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). So, the points are symmetric with respect to the origin.

So, the rhombus is formed by two pairs of points: A and C, B and D, each pair being diametrically opposite with respect to the origin.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider vectors OA, OB, OC, OD, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, OA and OC are opposite vectors, as are OB and OD.

So, OA = -OC and OB = -OD.

Given that, the diagonals are AC and BD. The lengths of the diagonals can be found using the distance formula. So, AC is the distance between A and C, which is 2 times the distance from O to A, since A and C are symmetric. Similarly, BD is 2 times the distance from O to B.

Wait, no, actually, the length of diagonal AC is the distance between A and C, which is sqrt[(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2] = sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2] = 2*sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Similarly, BD is 2*sqrt(p^2 + q^2), where B is (p, q).

But in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors OA and OB should be perpendicular. Because the diagonals are AC and BD, which are along OA and OB, so OA and OB must be perpendicular.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If the diagonals are AC and BD, then the vectors OA and OB are half of the diagonals. So, if the diagonals are perpendicular, then OA and OB must be perpendicular vectors.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero. So, if A is (x, y) and B is (p, q), then x*p + y*q = 0.

Also, since A and B lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\).

So, we have these conditions:

1. \(x*p + y*q = 0\)
2. \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\)
3. \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\)

We need to find BD^2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. Since BD is 2*sqrt(p^2 + q^2), so BD^2 is 4*(p^2 + q^2). So, we need to find the minimum value of BD^2, but wait, the problem says ""the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all such rhombuses."" So, essentially, we need the infimum of BD^2, the greatest lower bound.

Wait, but the problem says ""the greatest real number that is less than BD^2 for all these rhombuses."" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds, which is the infimum of BD^2. So, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD^2, and then the answer is that minimum value, because it's the greatest number less than BD^2 for all rhombuses.

Wait, no, actually, if we have to find the greatest number that is less than BD^2 for all rhombuses, that would be the infimum of BD^2. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if BD^2 can get arbitrarily close to some value, but never less than that, then that value is the infimum, and it's the greatest number less than BD^2 for all rhombuses.

So, our goal is to find the infimum of BD^2, which is 4*(p^2 + q^2), given the constraints above.

So, let's try to express p and q in terms of x and y, or find a relationship between them.

We have the condition that x*p + y*q = 0. So, we can write q = -(x*p)/y, assuming y ≠ 0.

But since both A and B lie on the hyperbola, we can write:

For point A: \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\)

For point B: \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\)

Substituting q from the first equation into the second equation:

\(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{(x^2 p^2)/(y^2)}{24} = 1\)

Simplify:

\(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{x^2 p^2}{24 y^2} = 1\)

Factor out p^2:

\(p^2 \left( \frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24 y^2} \right) = 1\)

So,

\(p^2 = \frac{1}{ \left( \frac{1}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24 y^2} \right) }\)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, since OA and OB are perpendicular, we can use the property that for two vectors to be perpendicular, the sum of the squares of their components relates to the hyperbola equation.

Wait, maybe parametrize the points on the hyperbola.

For hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we can parametrize it using hyperbolic functions. Let me recall that a standard parametrization for hyperbola is \(x = a \sec \theta\), \(y = b \tan \theta\), where a^2 = 20 and b^2 = 24. So, a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6).

So, let me set point A as (2√5 sec θ, 2√6 tan θ). Then, point C is (-2√5 sec θ, -2√6 tan θ).

Similarly, since OA and OB are perpendicular, point B can be parametrized as (2√5 sec φ, 2√6 tan φ), such that the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.

So, the dot product of OA and OB is zero:

(2√5 sec θ)(2√5 sec φ) + (2√6 tan θ)(2√6 tan φ) = 0

Simplify:

(4*5 sec θ sec φ) + (4*6 tan θ tan φ) = 0

20 sec θ sec φ + 24 tan θ tan φ = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

5 sec θ sec φ + 6 tan θ tan φ = 0

Hmm, that's an equation relating θ and φ.

Let me recall that sec^2 θ = 1 + tan^2 θ, so maybe we can express everything in terms of tan θ and tan φ.

Let me set t = tan θ and s = tan φ.

Then, sec θ = sqrt(1 + t^2), and sec φ = sqrt(1 + s^2).

So, substituting into the equation:

5 * sqrt(1 + t^2) * sqrt(1 + s^2) + 6 t s = 0

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But before that, let me see if I can find a relationship between t and s.

Wait, but 5 * sqrt(1 + t^2) * sqrt(1 + s^2) = -6 t s

Since the left side is a product of square roots, which are non-negative, and the right side is -6 t s. So, for the equation to hold, -6 t s must be non-negative. So, t s must be ≤ 0.

So, either t and s have opposite signs or one of them is zero. But if t or s is zero, then tan θ or tan φ is zero, which would mean θ or φ is 0 or π, but then the points would be on the vertices of the hyperbola, which might not form a rhombus. So, perhaps t and s have opposite signs.

So, let's proceed by squaring both sides:

[5 * sqrt(1 + t^2) * sqrt(1 + s^2)]^2 = (-6 t s)^2

25 (1 + t^2)(1 + s^2) = 36 t^2 s^2

Expanding the left side:

25(1 + t^2 + s^2 + t^2 s^2) = 36 t^2 s^2

25 + 25 t^2 + 25 s^2 + 25 t^2 s^2 = 36 t^2 s^2

Bring all terms to one side:

25 + 25 t^2 + 25 s^2 + 25 t^2 s^2 - 36 t^2 s^2 = 0

Simplify:

25 + 25 t^2 + 25 s^2 - 11 t^2 s^2 = 0

Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of t^2 and s^2. Maybe we can find a relationship between t and s.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express s in terms of t or vice versa.

Let me rearrange the equation:

25 + 25 t^2 + 25 s^2 = 11 t^2 s^2

Divide both sides by t^2 s^2 (assuming t ≠ 0 and s ≠ 0):

25/(t^2 s^2) + 25/(s^2) + 25/(t^2) = 11

Let me set u = 1/t^2 and v = 1/s^2. Then, the equation becomes:

25 u v + 25 u + 25 v = 11

Hmm, that's still a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor it.

25 u v + 25 u + 25 v = 11

Factor 25:

25(u v + u + v) = 11

So,

u v + u + v = 11/25

Hmm, maybe add 1 to both sides:

u v + u + v + 1 = 11/25 + 1 = 36/25

Factor the left side:

(u + 1)(v + 1) = 36/25

So,

(u + 1)(v + 1) = (6/5)^2

So, that's a nice equation. So, (u + 1)(v + 1) = (6/5)^2.

But u = 1/t^2 and v = 1/s^2, so:

(1/t^2 + 1)(1/s^2 + 1) = (6/5)^2

Which is:

( (1 + t^2)/t^2 ) ( (1 + s^2)/s^2 ) = 36/25

But 1 + t^2 = sec^2 θ, and 1 + s^2 = sec^2 φ.

So,

(sec^2 θ / t^2) (sec^2 φ / s^2) = 36/25

But t = tan θ, so sec^2 θ = 1 + tan^2 θ = 1 + t^2, so sec θ = sqrt(1 + t^2). Similarly for φ.

Wait, maybe this isn't the most straightforward path. Let me think differently.

We have (u + 1)(v + 1) = 36/25, where u = 1/t^2 and v = 1/s^2.

So, perhaps we can set u + 1 = (6/5) k and v + 1 = (6/5)/k, for some k > 0.

Then,

(u + 1)(v + 1) = (6/5)^2

So, u + 1 = (6/5) k and v + 1 = (6/5)/k

Therefore,

u = (6/5)k - 1

v = (6/(5k)) - 1

But u = 1/t^2 and v = 1/s^2, so:

1/t^2 = (6/5)k - 1

1/s^2 = (6/(5k))","[1, '1']",480,"[480, '480']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the different items they possess. Let me try to parse it step by step.

First, the total number of residents is 900. Each resident has a bag of candy hearts, so that's something everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf club sets, and garden shovels. The numbers given are:

- 195 residents have a diamond ring.
- 367 have a golf club set.
- 562 have a garden shovel.

Additionally, it's mentioned that 437 residents have exactly two of these things (excluding the candy hearts, I assume), and 234 have exactly three of these things. The question is asking for the number of residents who have all four items, which would include the candy hearts as well.

Hmm, okay. So, let me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem involving sets and their intersections. Since each resident has a candy heart, that's a given, so maybe we can consider the other three items as separate sets, and the candy hearts are just a universal set that everyone is part of.

So, let me denote:

- Let D be the set of residents with a diamond ring.
- Let G be the set with a golf club set.
- Let S be the set with a garden shovel.
- And since everyone has a bag of candy hearts, that's the universal set, so every resident is in that set.

We need to find the number of residents who have all four, which would be the intersection of D, G, S, and the universal set. But since the universal set includes everyone, the intersection would just be the intersection of D, G, and S. So, essentially, we need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Given that, let's recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But in this case, we also know something about the number of people who have exactly two items and exactly three items. Let me think about how that fits in.

The total number of residents is 900, and each has at least the candy hearts. So, the number of residents who have at least one of the other three items (diamond ring, golf club, garden shovel) plus those who have none of these three would equal 900. But wait, since everyone has the candy hearts, but it's possible that someone doesn't have any of the other three items. However, the problem doesn't specify that everyone has at least one of the other items, so we have to consider that possibility.

But let's see. The problem says each resident has a bag of candy hearts, but it doesn't say they have any of the other items. So, the total number of residents is 900, and some may have none of D, G, or S.

But wait, the problem also mentions that 437 have exactly two of these things, and 234 have exactly three. So, that suggests that the rest have either one, none, or all four. But since the question is about all four, which includes the candy hearts, which everyone has, so having all four would mean having D, G, S, and the candy hearts. But since the candy hearts are universal, having all four is equivalent to having D, G, and S.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think again.

Each resident has a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given. So, the other items are optional. So, the total number of residents is 900, each has the candy hearts, and some have additional items: diamond ring, golf club, garden shovel.

So, the number of residents who have exactly two of the other items (excluding candy hearts) is 437. Similarly, the number who have exactly three of the other items is 234. So, the rest must have either one, none, or all four (which would be the three items plus the candy hearts). But since the candy hearts are already given, having all four would mean having all three items plus the candy hearts, which is the same as having all three items because the candy hearts are universal.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to structure this.

Let me denote:

- Let a be the number of residents with only a diamond ring.
- Let b be the number with only a golf club set.
- Let c be the number with only a garden shovel.
- Let d be the number with exactly two items: diamond and golf.
- Let e be the number with exactly two items: diamond and shovel.
- Let f be the number with exactly two items: golf and shovel.
- Let g be the number with all three items: diamond, golf, and shovel.
- Let h be the number with none of the three items (only candy hearts).

Given that, the total number of residents is:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.

We are told that the number of residents with exactly two items is 437, so d + e + f = 437.

The number with exactly three items is 234, so g = 234.

We need to find the number of residents who have all four items, which would be g, but wait, no. Because g is the number with exactly three items (diamond, golf, shovel), but since everyone has the candy hearts, having all four would be the same as having all three items. So, actually, the number of residents with all four items is g, which is 234. But wait, that can't be, because the question is asking for the number of residents who have all four, which would be the same as those who have all three items, since the fourth is already given.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Each resident has a bag of candy hearts, so that's one item. Then, they can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or all four items. But since the candy hearts are already given, the other three items are optional. So, the number of residents with exactly two items would be those who have the candy hearts plus one other item. Wait, no, the problem says ""exactly two of these things,"" but it's unclear whether ""these things"" includes the candy hearts or not.

Wait, the problem says: ""Há 437 residentes que possuem exatamente duas dessas coisas, e 234 residentes que possuem exatamente três dessas coisas."" The Portuguese phrase ""dessas coisas"" refers back to the previous items mentioned, which were anel de diamante, conjunto de tacos de golfe, and pá de jardim. So, the candy hearts are separate. So, the 437 have exactly two of the three items (diamond, golf, shovel), and 234 have exactly three of those three items.

Therefore, the number of residents with all four items (candy hearts plus all three items) would be separate from these counts. So, we need to find the number of residents who have all four, which is the intersection of D, G, S, and the universal set (candy hearts). But since the universal set includes everyone, it's just the intersection of D, G, and S.

So, let's denote:

- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562

We need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

We also know that the number of residents with exactly two of D, G, S is 437, and exactly three is 234.

Let me recall that in inclusion-exclusion, the total number of residents with at least one of D, G, S is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But we also know that the number of residents with exactly two items is 437, and exactly three is 234. So, the total number of residents with at least one of D, G, S is:

Number with exactly one + number with exactly two + number with exactly three.

But we don't know the number with exactly one. Let me denote:

- Let x be the number with exactly one item (either D, G, or S).
- Then, the total number with at least one is x + 437 + 234.

But we also know that the total number of residents is 900, and some may have none of D, G, S. Let me denote h as the number with none of D, G, S (only candy hearts). So:

x + 437 + 234 + h = 900

So, x + h = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, x + h = 229.

But we need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is the number of residents with all three items, which is 234. Wait, no, because 234 is the number with exactly three items, which is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|, right? Because having exactly three items means they have all three, so that's the intersection.

Wait, but in inclusion-exclusion, |D ∩ G ∩ S| is the number of residents with all three, which is 234. So, that's our g.

But let's see. Let me try to write down the inclusion-exclusion formula.

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

We can also express |D ∪ G ∪ S| as the number of residents with at least one of D, G, S, which is x + 437 + 234.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = x + 437 + 234 = x + 671.

But we also have that x + h = 229, so x = 229 - h.

Therefore, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = (229 - h) + 671 = 900 - h.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| is also equal to |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, let's plug in the numbers:

|D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.

So, |D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = let's calculate that.

195 + 367 = 562, 562 + 562 = 1124.

So, |D| + |G| + |S| = 1124.

Now, we have:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 1124 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But we also have |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - h.

So, 1124 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 900 - h.

But we need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is 234, right? Wait, no, because |D ∩ G ∩ S| is the number of residents with all three items, which is 234. So, that's given.

Wait, but let me think again. The number of residents with exactly three items is 234, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S|. So, that's our g.

But in inclusion-exclusion, |D ∩ G ∩ S| is the same as the number of residents with all three, which is 234.

So, plugging that in:

1124 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + 234 = 900 - h

Simplify:

1124 + 234 = 1358

So, 1358 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) = 900 - h

Therefore,

(|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) = 1358 - (900 - h) = 1358 - 900 + h = 458 + h

So, |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 458 + h

But we also know that the number of residents with exactly two items is 437. The number of residents with exactly two items is equal to the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the triple intersection. Wait, no, the number with exactly two items is:

(|D ∩ G| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|D ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) + (|G ∩ S| - |D ∩ G ∩ S|) = 437

So, that's:

(|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) - 3|D ∩ G ∩ S| = 437

We know |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 234, so:

(|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) - 3*234 = 437

We already have |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 458 + h

So, substituting:

(458 + h) - 702 = 437

Simplify:

458 + h - 702 = 437

(458 - 702) + h = 437

-244 + h = 437

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter (O) is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter (I) is the intersection of the angle bisectors.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a key piece of information. I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. Let me sketch triangle ABC with O and I inside it. IA is one of the angle bisectors, and OI is the line connecting the incenter and circumcenter. The fact that IA is perpendicular to OI might imply some right triangles or maybe some properties related to distances in the triangle.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI = √(R(R - 2r))

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me plug in the given values:

OI = √(13(13 - 2*6)) = √(13*(13 - 12)) = √(13*1) = √13

So, the distance between O and I is √13. That's a useful piece of information.

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at A. Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Or at A? Let me think. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the lines IA and OI intersect at a right angle. Since I is the incenter, and O is the circumcenter, their line OI is being intersected perpendicularly by IA. So, the point where IA and OI meet is point A? Wait, no, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is a segment from O to I. So, IA and OI meet at I, and they are perpendicular there. So, the angle at I between IA and OI is 90 degrees.

So, triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

OA² = OI² + IA²

But OA is the circumradius, which is given as 13. So,

13² = (√13)² + IA²

Calculating that:

169 = 13 + IA²

So, IA² = 169 - 13 = 156

Therefore, IA = √156. Let me simplify that:

√156 = √(4*39) = 2√39

So, IA is 2√39. Hmm, okay.

Now, I need to relate this to the sides of the triangle. I know that in a triangle, the length of the inradius can be expressed as r = Δ/s, where Δ is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. Also, the circumradius R is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here. Maybe I should think about the formula for the length of the angle bisector or something related to the inradius and the distances from the incenter.

Wait, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. There is a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. Let me recall that. I think it's given by:

IA = √(r² + (s - a)²)

Where s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A. Is that correct? Let me verify.

Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed as:

IA = √(r² + (s - a)²)

Similarly, IB = √(r² + (s - b)²) and IC = √(r² + (s - c)²)

So, in this case, IA = √(6² + (s - a)²) = √(36 + (s - a)²)

But we already found that IA = 2√39, so:

√(36 + (s - a)²) = 2√39

Squaring both sides:

36 + (s - a)² = 4*39 = 156

So, (s - a)² = 156 - 36 = 120

Therefore, s - a = √120 = 2√30

So, s - a = 2√30

Hmm, okay. So, s - a is 2√30. Let me note that.

Also, since s is the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, s - a = (b + c - a)/2 = 2√30

Therefore, b + c - a = 4√30

So, that's one equation.

Now, I need more relations to find AB * AC, which is c * b, assuming AB = c and AC = b.

Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, and c is AB. So, yes, AB = c, AC = b.

So, I need to find b * c.

I have that b + c - a = 4√30.

Also, I know that the area Δ can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semi-perimeter: Δ = r * s = 6s.

Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius: Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52

Therefore, a*b*c = 52*6s = 312s

So, a*b*c = 312s

Hmm, okay. So, if I can find a, b, c in terms of s, maybe I can find s and then find b*c.

But I have another relation: b + c - a = 4√30

Also, from the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2, so a = 2s - b - c

Plugging that into the previous equation:

b + c - (2s - b - c) = 4√30

Simplify:

b + c - 2s + b + c = 4√30

2b + 2c - 2s = 4√30

Divide both sides by 2:

b + c - s = 2√30

But s = (a + b + c)/2, so b + c = 2s - a

Wait, but from above, b + c - a = 4√30, so substituting:

(2s - a) - a = 4√30

2s - 2a = 4√30

Divide both sides by 2:

s - a = 2√30

Which is consistent with what we had earlier.

So, s - a = 2√30, which is the same as a = s - 2√30

So, a = s - 2√30

So, now, let's try to express other variables in terms of s.

We have a = s - 2√30

Also, from the area expressions:

Δ = 6s = (a*b*c)/52

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312s

So, if I can express a, b, c in terms of s, maybe I can find s.

But I need more relations. Let's think about the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius.

We have OI = √(R(R - 2r)) = √(13*(13 - 12)) = √13, as we found earlier.

But also, in triangle ABC, there is a relation involving OI, R, r, and other elements.

Wait, another formula: OI² = R² - 2Rr

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall.

Yes, in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumradius is given by:

OI² = R² - 2Rr

So, plugging in the values:

(√13)² = 13² - 2*13*r

Wait, but r is 6, so:

13 = 169 - 26*6

13 = 169 - 156

13 = 13

So, that's consistent. So, that doesn't give us new information.

Hmm, okay. Maybe I need to use the formula for IA.

We have IA = 2√39, and IA = √(r² + (s - a)²) = √(36 + (s - a)²)

Which we already used to find s - a = 2√30.

So, perhaps I need to find another relation.

Wait, maybe using the formula for the length of the angle bisector. Since IA is the angle bisector, but I think that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.

Let me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the line from O(0,0) to I(x,y). IA is perpendicular to OI, so the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.

Wait, maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let me denote the coordinates:

Let O be at (0,0). Let I be at some point (h,k). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.

Vector OI is (h,k). Vector IA is (A - I), where A is a point on the circumcircle.

But A is a vertex of the triangle, so OA = R = 13. So, point A is somewhere on the circle of radius 13 centered at O.

Let me denote point A as (x,y). Then, vector IA is (x - h, y - k). Vector OI is (h,k). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular:

(x - h)*h + (y - k)*k = 0

So,

h(x - h) + k(y - k) = 0

Which simplifies to:

hx - h² + ky - k² = 0

So,

hx + ky = h² + k²

But point A lies on the circumcircle, so x² + y² = 13² = 169.

So, we have two equations:

1. hx + ky = h² + k²

2. x² + y² = 169

We can solve for x and y in terms of h and k.

But I also know that I is the incenter. The coordinates of the incenter can be given in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Wait, but without knowing the sides, it's difficult. Maybe this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities.

Let me recall that in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed as:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

Similarly, IB = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{B}{2}}, IC = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{C}{2}}

So, IA = 2√39 = \frac{6}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

Therefore,

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = √39 / 13

Wait, because 3 / √39 = 3√39 / 39 = √39 / 13

So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13

Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (√39 / 13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 39/169) = sqrt(130/169) = √130 / 13

So, cos(A/2) = √130 / 13

Now, in triangle ABC, the circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula:

a = 2R sin A

Similarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C

So, a = 2*13*sin A = 26 sin A

Similarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C

Also, since in any triangle, A + B + C = π, so we can relate the angles.

Moreover, the inradius r is related to the area and semi-perimeter:

r = Δ / s

Where Δ is the area, and s = (a + b + c)/2

We also have Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52

So, r = (a*b*c)/(52s) = 6

So, (a*b*c) = 6*52*s = 312s

So, a*b*c = 312s

But a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C

So, a*b*c = 26^3 sin A sin B sin C = 17576 sin A sin B sin C

Therefore,

17576 sin A sin B sin C = 312s

So,

sin A sin B sin C = (312s)/17576 = (312/17576)s = (312 ÷ 312)/(17576 ÷ 312) s = 1/56.333... s

Wait, 17576 ÷ 312: Let me compute that.

312 * 56 = 17520

17576 - 17520 = 56

So, 312 * 56.333... = 17576

Wait, 312 * 56 = 17520","[17520, '17520']",468,"[468, '468']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of non-negative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that a, b, and c are non-negative integers, so they can be 0 or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated. It involves quadratic terms multiplied by the other variables. Let me write it out again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see. If I factor out common terms, I notice that each term has two variables, one squared and one linear. For example, a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, the entire expression can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

That's a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me do that:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So, now the equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange the terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So, I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find expressions for these in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I remember that for three variables, there are some identities that relate these sums. For example, the square of the sum:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

We know that a + b + c = 300, so:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Calculating 300², that's 90,000. So,

90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = a² + b² + c², and P = ab + bc + ca. Then, the equation becomes:

90,000 = Q + 2P.

So, Q = 90,000 - 2P.

Now, going back to the other equation:

300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me denote C = a³ + b³ + c³. Then,

300Q - C = 6,000,000.

We can substitute Q from the previous equation:

300(90,000 - 2P) - C = 6,000,000.

Calculating 300*90,000: 300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

So,

27,000,000 - 600P - C = 6,000,000.

Subtracting 6,000,000 from both sides:

21,000,000 - 600P - C = 0.

So,

C = 21,000,000 - 600P.

Now, I need another identity involving C, which is a³ + b³ + c³. I recall that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, substituting the known values:

C = S³ - 3SP + 3abc.

We know S = 300, so S³ = 300³ = 27,000,000.

Therefore,

C = 27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3abc.

Simplify:

C = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.

But earlier, we had C = 21,000,000 - 600P. So, setting them equal:

27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc = 21,000,000 - 600P.

Let me subtract 21,000,000 from both sides:

6,000,000 - 900P + 3abc = -600P.

Bring all terms to one side:

6,000,000 - 900P + 3abc + 600P = 0.

Simplify:

6,000,000 - 300P + 3abc = 0.

Divide both sides by 3:

2,000,000 - 100P + abc = 0.

So,

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have abc expressed in terms of P. Let me write that down:

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, I need to find non-negative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300, and abc = 100P - 2,000,000, where P = ab + bc + ca.

This seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can find some constraints on a, b, c.

First, since a, b, c are non-negative integers, and their sum is 300, each of them is at most 300.

Also, since abc is expressed in terms of P, which is ab + bc + ca, perhaps I can find some relationship or bounds.

Let me think about possible cases where a, b, c might be equal or have some symmetry.

Case 1: All three variables are equal.

If a = b = c, then a + b + c = 3a = 300, so a = 100. Then, let's check if this satisfies the second equation.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b = c = 100, each term is 100²*100 = 1,000,000. There are six such terms, so total is 6,000,000. Perfect, that's exactly the value we need.

So, (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

Case 2: Two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Let me assume a = b ≠ c. Then, a + a + c = 300 => 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.

Now, let's compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b, this becomes:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Simplify:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c².

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²).

We know c = 300 - 2a, so substitute:

2a(a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)²).

Let me compute each term inside the parentheses:

First term: a².

Second term: a(300 - 2a) = 300a - 2a².

Third term: (300 - 2a)² = 90,000 - 1200a + 4a².

So, adding them together:

a² + (300a - 2a²) + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a²) =

a² + 300a - 2a² + 90,000 - 1200a + 4a² =

Combine like terms:

(a² - 2a² + 4a²) + (300a - 1200a) + 90,000 =

(3a²) + (-900a) + 90,000.

So, the expression becomes:

2a(3a² - 900a + 90,000).

Simplify:

6a³ - 1800a² + 180,000a.

We know this should equal 6,000,000.

So,

6a³ - 1800a² + 180,000a = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 6:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000.

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, this is a cubic equation. Let me try to find integer roots. Maybe a is a factor of 1,000,000. Let's try a = 100:

100³ - 300*100² + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 =

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.

So, a = 100 is a root. Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1  -300   30,000  -1,000,000

          100  -20,000   1,000,000

      ----------------------------

        1  -200   10,000        0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000).

Now, set the quadratic equal to zero:

a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

a = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100.

So, the only root is a = 100, which is a double root.

Therefore, the only solution in this case is a = 100, which gives c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So, again, a = b = c = 100. So, this case doesn't give any new solutions beyond the all-equal case.

Case 3: All variables are different.

Hmm, this might be more complicated. Maybe I can consider that if two variables are equal, we already saw that only the all-equal case works. So, perhaps the only solution is when all three are equal? But I need to verify.

Wait, maybe I can think about the expression for abc. Earlier, I had:

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

But P = ab + bc + ca.

So, abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Let me denote ab + bc + ca = P, so:

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

But I also know that a + b + c = 300.

So, perhaps I can express abc in terms of P and then find possible values.

Alternatively, maybe I can use inequalities to bound the variables.

I know that for non-negative integers a, b, c, the following inequality holds:

(a + b + c)^3 >= 27abc.

This is from the AM-GM inequality, where (a + b + c)/3 >= (abc)^(1/3).

So, 300^3 >= 27abc => 27,000,000 >= 27abc => abc <= 1,000,000.

But from earlier, abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

So,

100P - 2,000,000 <= 1,000,000.

Thus,

100P <= 3,000,000 => P <= 30,000.

But also, from the equation Q = 90,000 - 2P, and since Q = a² + b²","[2, '2']",601,"[601, '601']",False
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, plotting these points, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis from O to (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis, specifically at (0, sqrt(3)/2). That makes sense because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so it's a bit less than 1 on the y-axis.

Now, there's this family of segments F, which are all the segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. Each segment has point P on the x-axis and point Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and the distance between P and Q is 1. That means sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1, right? So, p^2 + q^2 = 1. 

So, all these segments PQ are in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, and each has length 1. So, the set of all such segments forms a kind of curve or family of lines in the first quadrant.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any of these segments PQ except for the segment AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments? Wait, let me check.

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the distance between A and B is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so it's part of the family F. So, AB is one of these PQ segments.

But the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, every other point on AB is on some other segment from F, but C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, we need to find this point C and compute OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to C. Then express that as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.

Alright, so let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's parametrize the segment AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the parametric equations for AB can be written as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and when t=1, we're at B.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, we need to find a point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on them.

But how do we ensure that? Well, for a point C = (x, y) to lie on a segment PQ, which connects (p, 0) to (0, q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1, the point C must satisfy the equation of the line PQ.

The equation of the line PQ can be written in intercept form: x/p + y/q = 1. Since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2), but since we're in the first quadrant, q is positive.

So, the equation becomes x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.

So, for point C = (x, y) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1 for some p in (0,1).

But we want point C such that this equation is only satisfied when PQ is AB itself. So, for all other p ≠ p_AB, the equation x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) ≠ 1.

So, we need to find (x, y) on AB such that the only solution p to x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1 is p = p_AB, which is 1/2, since AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, p_AB = 1/2, q_AB = sqrt(3)/2.

So, for point C on AB, we need that the equation x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1 has only one solution p = 1/2.

But how do we ensure that? Maybe by considering that the equation x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1 has a double root at p = 1/2, meaning that the equation is tangent to AB at point C.

Wait, that might be a good approach. If the line PQ is tangent to AB at point C, then C would lie on only that PQ and AB. But in our case, AB is already a segment in F, so if another segment PQ is tangent to AB at C, then C would lie on both AB and PQ, which we don't want. So, actually, we need that for point C, there is no other PQ in F that passes through C except AB.

So, perhaps the point C is such that the system of equations given by AB and PQ has only one solution, which is C. So, maybe the line PQ is tangent to AB at C, but since AB is already in F, that would mean that C is the point where another PQ is tangent to AB, but since we don't want C to lie on any other PQ, maybe C is the point where the envelope of all PQs touches AB.

Wait, this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should think in terms of parametric equations.

Let me denote point C as (x, y) on AB. So, x = 1/2 - (1/2)t and y = (sqrt(3)/2)t for some t in (0,1).

Now, for point C to lie on another segment PQ, there must exist some p in (0,1) such that x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.

So, substituting x and y:

(1/2 - (1/2)t)/p + (sqrt(3)/2 t)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.

We need to find t such that this equation has only one solution p = 1/2. So, for other p, this equation shouldn't hold.

Alternatively, we can think of this as an equation in p, and we want that equation to have only one solution p = 1/2. So, the equation should have a double root at p = 1/2.

So, let's set up the equation:

(1/2 - (1/2)t)/p + (sqrt(3)/2 t)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.

Let me denote s = p for simplicity.

So, (1/2 - (1/2)t)/s + (sqrt(3)/2 t)/sqrt(1 - s^2) = 1.

We can write this as:

(1 - t)/(2s) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sqrt(1 - s^2)) = 1.

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

(1 - t)/s + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - s^2) = 2.

Now, we want this equation to have only one solution s = 1/2. So, we can set s = 1/2 and see what t would make this equation hold, but we also need to ensure that for other s, the equation doesn't hold.

But actually, since we want that for point C, the equation has only s = 1/2 as a solution, we can think of this as a function f(s) = (1 - t)/s + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - s^2) - 2 = 0, and we want f(s) = 0 only when s = 1/2.

To ensure that, we can set up the equation such that s = 1/2 is a double root, meaning that f(s) and its derivative f’(s) both equal zero at s = 1/2.

So, let's compute f(s):

f(s) = (1 - t)/s + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - s^2) - 2.

Compute f(1/2):

f(1/2) = (1 - t)/(1/2) + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) - 2

Simplify:

= 2(1 - t) + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(3/4) - 2

= 2(1 - t) + (sqrt(3) t)/(sqrt(3)/2) - 2

= 2(1 - t) + 2t - 2

= 2 - 2t + 2t - 2

= 0.

So, f(1/2) = 0, which is expected because point C is on AB, which is a segment in F.

Now, compute the derivative f’(s):

f’(s) = derivative of (1 - t)/s + derivative of (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 - s^2) - derivative of 2.

So,

f’(s) = -(1 - t)/s^2 + (sqrt(3) t) * (1/2)(1 - s^2)^(-3/2) * (2s)

Simplify:

= -(1 - t)/s^2 + (sqrt(3) t) * s / (1 - s^2)^(3/2)

Now, evaluate f’(s) at s = 1/2:

f’(1/2) = -(1 - t)/(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3) t) * (1/2) / (1 - (1/2)^2)^(3/2)

Simplify:

= -(1 - t)/(1/4) + (sqrt(3) t * 1/2) / (sqrt(3)/2)^(3)

= -4(1 - t) + (sqrt(3) t / 2) / ( (3^(1/2)/2)^3 )

Wait, let's compute the denominator:

(1 - (1/2)^2) = 3/4, so (3/4)^(3/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3^(1/2)/2)^3 = 3^(3/2)/8.

So, the second term becomes:

(sqrt(3) t / 2) / (3^(3/2)/8) = (sqrt(3) t / 2) * (8 / 3^(3/2)) )

Simplify sqrt(3) / 3^(3/2) = 1 / 3^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(3).

So, the second term is (1/sqrt(3)) * t / 2 * 8 = (1/sqrt(3)) * (4t) = 4t / sqrt(3).

So, putting it all together:

f’(1/2) = -4(1 - t) + 4t / sqrt(3).

We want f’(1/2) = 0 because we want s = 1/2 to be a double root.

So,

-4(1 - t) + (4t)/sqrt(3) = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

-(1 - t) + t / sqrt(3) = 0

Simplify:

-1 + t + t / sqrt(3) = 0

Combine like terms:

t(1 + 1/sqrt(3)) = 1

Factor t:

t = 1 / (1 + 1/sqrt(3)) = 1 / ( (sqrt(3) + 1)/sqrt(3) ) = sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3) + 1)

Rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(3) - 1):

t = sqrt(3)(sqrt(3) - 1) / ( (sqrt(3) + 1)(sqrt(3) - 1) )

Simplify denominator:

= (3 - 1) = 2

Numerator:

= sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)*1 = 3 - sqrt(3)

So, t = (3 - sqrt(3))/2

Wait, but t is a parameter between 0 and 1 on segment AB. Let's compute (3 - sqrt(3))/2:

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 3 - 1.732 ≈ 1.268, divided by 2 is ≈ 0.634, which is between 0 and 1. So, that's acceptable.

So, t = (3 - sqrt(3))/2.

Now, let's find the coordinates of point C.

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t = 1/2 - (1/2)*(3 - sqrt(3))/2 = 1/2 - (3 - sqrt(3))/4

= (2/4 - 3/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = (-1/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = (sqrt(3) - 1)/4

Similarly, y = (sqrt(3)/2)t = (sqrt(3)/2)*(3 - sqrt(3))/2 = (sqrt(3)(3 - sqrt(3)))/4

= (3 sqrt(3) - 3)/4

So, point C is at ( (sqrt(3) - 1)/4 , (3 sqrt(3) - 3)/4 )

Now, we need to compute OC^2, which is x^2 + y^2.

Compute x^2:

( (sqrt(3) - 1)/4 )^2 = ( (sqrt(3))^2 - 2 sqrt(3) + 1 ) / 16 = (3 - 2 sqrt(3) + 1)/16 = (4 - 2 sqrt(3))/16 = (2 - sqrt(3))/8

Compute y^2:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000. Here, \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \(\omega^{13} = 1\). Also, the minimal polynomial for \(\omega\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \(\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1\). That might come in handy later.

Now, looking at the product, it's from \(k = 0\) to \(k = 12\), so that's 13 terms. Each term is of the form \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). I wonder if I can factor this expression or relate it to some known polynomial.

Let me consider the expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Maybe I can factor it or write it in a different form. Let's see:

\(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\)

Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \(\omega^k\). Let me set \(x = \omega^k\), so the expression becomes \(2 - 2x + x^2\). That's a quadratic equation: \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). Let me see if I can factor this or find its roots.

The discriminant of this quadratic is \(b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4\). So, the roots are complex: \(x = [2 \pm \sqrt{-4}]/2 = 1 \pm i\). So, \(x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\).

Therefore, each term in the product can be written as \((\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\). So, the entire product becomes:

\(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\)

Which is the same as:

\(\left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \right) \times \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \right)\)

So, now I have two separate products to compute. Let me denote them as \(P_1 = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i))\) and \(P_2 = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))\). Then, the original product is \(P_1 \times P_2\).

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - \omega^k)\) is equal to \(x^n - 1\) when \(\omega\) is a primitive nth root of unity. But in this case, we have \(x = 1 + i\) and \(x = 1 - i\), so maybe I can use this idea.

Wait, actually, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k)\) is equal to \(x^{13} - 1\), since \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity. So, if I plug in \(x = 1 + i\) into this product, I get \(P_1 = (1 + i)^{13} - 1\). Similarly, \(P_2 = (1 - i)^{13} - 1\).

So, now I can write:

\(P_1 = (1 + i)^{13} - 1\)

\(P_2 = (1 - i)^{13} - 1\)

Therefore, the original product is:

\([(1 + i)^{13} - 1] \times [(1 - i)^{13} - 1]\)

Hmm, okay, so I need to compute this product. Let me compute each part step by step.

First, let's compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\). I know that \(1 + i\) can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of \(1 + i\) is \(\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}\), and the argument is \(\pi/4\). So, \(1 + i = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \right)\).

Similarly, \(1 - i\) has modulus \(\sqrt{2}\) and argument \(-\pi/4\), so \(1 - i = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin \left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)\).

Using De Moivre's theorem, \((1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \left( \cos \frac{13\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{13\pi}{4} \right)\).

Similarly, \((1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \left( \cos \left(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin \left(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\right) \right)\).

Let me compute \((\sqrt{2})^{13}\). Since \((\sqrt{2})^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 \times 2^{1/2} = 64 \times \sqrt{2}\). So, both \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\) have a modulus of \(64\sqrt{2}\).

Now, let's compute the angles. \(\frac{13\pi}{4}\) is equal to \(3\pi + \pi/4\), which is equivalent to \(\pi/4\) in the third quadrant. So, \(\cos \frac{13\pi}{4} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), but since it's in the third quadrant, it's negative. Similarly, \(\sin \frac{13\pi}{4} = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), also negative in the third quadrant.

Wait, actually, \(\frac{13\pi}{4}\) is more than \(2\pi\). Let me subtract \(2\pi\) to find the equivalent angle. \(13\pi/4 - 2\pi = 13\pi/4 - 8\pi/4 = 5\pi/4\). So, \(\cos \frac{13\pi}{4} = \cos \frac{5\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), and \(\sin \frac{13\pi}{4} = \sin \frac{5\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

Similarly, \(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\) is equivalent to \(-\frac{13\pi}{4} + 4\pi = \frac{3\pi}{4}\). So, \(\cos \left(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\right) = \cos \frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), and \(\sin \left(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\right) = \sin \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), but since it's negative angle, it's \(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

Wait, hold on, actually, \(\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta\), so \(\sin \left(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\right) = -\sin \frac{13\pi}{4} = -(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\). Hmm, maybe I confused that earlier.

Wait, let me clarify:

For \((1 + i)^{13}\):

Angle is \(13\pi/4\), which is \(3\pi + \pi/4\), so in the third quadrant.

So, \(\cos(13\pi/4) = \cos(5\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2\)

\(\sin(13\pi/4) = \sin(5\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2\)

Similarly, for \((1 - i)^{13}\):

Angle is \(-13\pi/4\), which is equivalent to \( -13\pi/4 + 4\pi = 3\pi/4\). So, in the second quadrant.

\(\cos(-13\pi/4) = \cos(3\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2\)

\(\sin(-13\pi/4) = \sin(3\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2\), but since it's negative angle, it's \(-\sin(13\pi/4)\). Wait, no, actually, \(\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta\), so \(\sin(-13\pi/4) = -\sin(13\pi/4) = -(-\sqrt{2}/2) = \sqrt{2}/2\).

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\) using binomial expansion or another method.

But perhaps using polar form is still manageable.

So, \((1 + i)^{13} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{13} \left( \cos \frac{13\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{13\pi}{4} \right) = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{5\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{4} \right) = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)\).

Multiplying this out:

\(64 \sqrt{2} \times -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 64 \times (-1) = -64\)

Similarly, the imaginary part:

\(64 \sqrt{2} \times -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i = 64 \times (-1) i = -64i\)

So, \((1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i\)

Similarly, let's compute \((1 - i)^{13}\):

\((1 - i)^{13} = ( \sqrt{2} )^{13} \left( \cos \left(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin \left(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\right) \right) = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{3\pi}{4} - i \sin \frac{3\pi}{4} \right)\)

Because \(\cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta\) and \(\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta\).

So, \(\cos \frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), and \(\sin \frac{3\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), so:

\(64 \sqrt{2} \times -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 64 \times (-1) = -64\)

And the imaginary part:

\(64 \sqrt{2} \times -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i = 64 \times (-1) i = -64i\), but wait, hold on:

Wait, \(\sin(-13\pi/4) = -\sin(13\pi/4) = -(-\sqrt{2}/2) = \sqrt{2}/2\). So, actually, the imaginary part is positive.

Wait, let me recast:

\((1 - i)^{13} = 64 \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{3\pi}{4} + i \sin \left(-\frac{13\pi}{4}\right) \right)\)

But \(\sin(-13\pi/4) = -\sin(13\pi/4) = -(-\sqrt{2}/2) = \sqrt{2}/2\). So, the expression becomes:

\(64 \sqrt{2} \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)\)

Multiplying out:

Real part: \(64 \sqrt{2} \times -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -64\)

Imaginary part: \(64 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i = 64 \times 1 i = 64i\)

So, \((1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i\)

Okay, so now we have:

\(P_1 = (1 + i)^{13} - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 =","[1, '1']",321,"[321, '321']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is called \( b \)-eautiful if when expressed in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). 

Let me try to break this down. First, if \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), that means in base 10, \( n \) can be written as \( n = a \times b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits in base \( b \). Since it's a two-digit number, \( a \) must be at least 1 and less than \( b \), and \( c \) must be between 0 and \( b-1 \). 

The condition for \( n \) being \( b \)-eautiful is that \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). So substituting \( n \) from above, we get \( a + c = \sqrt{a \times b + c} \). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\( (a + c)^2 = a \times b + c \)

Expanding the left side:

\( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a \times b + c \)

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

\( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a \times b - c = 0 \)

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( c \). Let's try that.

Starting from \( (a + c)^2 = a \times b + c \), we can solve for \( b \):

\( a \times b = (a + c)^2 - c \)

So,

\( b = \frac{(a + c)^2 - c}{a} \)

Simplify the numerator:

\( (a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c \)

So,

\( b = \frac{a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c}{a} \)

Let me split the fraction:

\( b = \frac{a^2}{a} + \frac{2ac}{a} + \frac{c^2 - c}{a} \)

Simplify each term:

\( b = a + 2c + \frac{c^2 - c}{a} \)

Since \( b \) must be an integer, the term \( \frac{c^2 - c}{a} \) must also be an integer. Let me denote this term as \( k \), so:

\( k = \frac{c^2 - c}{a} \)

Which implies:

\( a \) divides \( c^2 - c \). So, \( a \) is a divisor of \( c(c - 1) \).

Given that \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), \( a \) is between 1 and \( b - 1 \), and \( c \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \). But since \( a \) is a digit in the two-digit number, \( a \) must be at least 1.

So, for each base \( b \), I need to find all pairs \( (a, c) \) such that \( a \) divides \( c(c - 1) \), and then compute \( b \) using the equation above. But since \( b \) is fixed for each case, maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps I should fix \( b \) and then find all possible \( a \) and \( c \) that satisfy the equation \( (a + c)^2 = a \times b + c \). Then, count how many such \( n \) exist for each \( b \) and find the smallest \( b \) where this count exceeds 10.

Yes, that makes sense. So, for each \( b \) starting from 2 upwards, I can iterate through all possible \( a \) and \( c \) values (with \( a \) from 1 to \( b - 1 \) and \( c \) from 0 to \( b - 1 \)), check if \( (a + c)^2 = a \times b + c \), and count the number of valid \( n \).

But since I need the smallest \( b \) where this count is more than 10, I can start checking from \( b = 2 \) upwards until I find such a \( b \).

However, this might take a long time if done manually, so maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute the number of solutions for each \( b \) without checking each pair individually.

Let me revisit the equation:

\( (a + c)^2 = a b + c \)

Let me denote \( s = a + c \), so \( s^2 = a b + c \). But \( c = s - a \), so substituting back:

\( s^2 = a b + (s - a) \)

Simplify:

\( s^2 = a b + s - a \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( s^2 - s = a (b - 1) \)

So,

\( a = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \)

Since \( a \) must be an integer between 1 and \( b - 1 \), \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s^2 - s \). Also, \( s = a + c \), and since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), \( s \) can range from \( 1 + 0 = 1 \) up to \( (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2 \). But since \( s = \sqrt{n} \), and \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), \( n \) must be at least \( b \) (since the smallest two-digit number is \( 10_b = b \)) and at most \( (b - 1) \times b + (b - 1) = b^2 - 1 \). Therefore, \( s = \sqrt{n} \) must satisfy \( \sqrt{b} \leq s \leq \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \). Since \( s \) is an integer, \( s \) must be between \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) and \( \lfloor \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \rfloor \). But \( \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \) is slightly less than \( b \), so \( s \) can be up to \( b - 1 \).

Wait, let me think again. \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), so \( n \) is between \( b \) and \( b^2 - 1 \). Therefore, \( s = \sqrt{n} \) must satisfy \( \sqrt{b} \leq s \leq \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \). Since \( s \) is an integer, the minimum \( s \) is \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) and the maximum \( s \) is \( \lfloor \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \rfloor \). But \( \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \) is less than \( b \), so the maximum \( s \) is \( b - 1 \).

Therefore, \( s \) ranges from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).

So, for each \( b \), the possible values of \( s \) are integers from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \). For each such \( s \), we can compute \( a = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \). If \( a \) is an integer between 1 and \( b - 1 \), and \( c = s - a \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \), then \( n = a b + c \) is a \( b \)-eautiful number.

Therefore, the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers \( s \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \) such that \( b - 1 \) divides \( s^2 - s \), and \( a = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \) is an integer between 1 and \( b - 1 \), and \( c = s - a \) is between 0 and \( b - 1 \).

This seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can find a way to count the number of such \( s \) for each \( b \).

Alternatively, since \( a = \frac{s(s - 1)}{b - 1} \), and \( a \) must be an integer, \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s(s - 1) \). So, for each \( b \), the number of \( s \) such that \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \) and \( a \) and \( c \) are valid digits.

Let me consider that \( s(s - 1) \) must be divisible by \( b - 1 \). Since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, \( b - 1 \) must divide either \( s \) or \( s - 1 \), or be a product of factors from both.

But since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( b - 1 \) must be a divisor of \( s \) or a divisor of \( s - 1 \), or a product of a divisor of \( s \) and a divisor of \( s - 1 \). However, since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, the only way \( b - 1 \) divides \( s(s - 1) \) is if \( b - 1 \) is a product of a divisor of \( s \) and a divisor of \( s - 1 \). But since they are coprime, the number of such \( s \) would be related to the number of divisors of \( b - 1 \).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me denote \( d = b - 1 \). Then, \( d \) must divide \( s(s - 1) \). Since \( s \) and \( s - 1 \) are coprime, \( d \) must be a product of two coprime numbers, one dividing \( s \) and the other dividing \( s - 1 \). Therefore, the number of solutions \( s \) is equal to the number of ways to write \( d \) as a product of two coprime numbers \( k \) and \( m \), where \( k \) divides \( s \) and \( m \) divides \( s - 1 \). For each such pair \( (k, m) \), we can solve for \( s \) such that \( s \equiv 0 \mod k \) and \( s \equiv 1 \mod m \). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since \( k \) and \( m \) are coprime, there is a unique solution modulo \( km \). Therefore, the number of solutions \( s \) in the range \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \) is equal to the number of such pairs \( (k, m) \) where \( km = d \) and \( k \) and \( m \) are coprime.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can think in terms of the number of divisors of \( d = b - 1 \). Since \( d \) can be factored into prime factors, the number of ways to write \( d \) as a product of two coprime numbers is \( 2^{k} \), where \( k \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( d \). For example, if \( d \) is a prime, then it can be written as \( 1 \times d \) or \( d \times 1 \), so two ways. If \( d \) is a product of two distinct primes, say \( p \times q \), then the number of ways is 4: \( 1 \times pq \), \( p \times q \), \( q \times p \), \( pq \times 1 \). Wait, but since \( k \) and \( m \) are ordered, it's actually \( 2^k \) where \( k \) is the number of distinct prime factors.

But in our case, since \( k \) and \( m \) are positive integers such that \( km = d \) and \( \gcd(k, m) = 1 \), the number of such pairs is \( 2^{t} \), where \( t \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( d \). For example, if \( d \) is prime, \( t = 1 \), so 2 pairs. If \( d \) is a product of two distinct primes, \( t = 2 \), so 4 pairs, etc.

However, each such pair \( (k, m) \) gives a unique solution \( s \) modulo \( d \). Therefore, in the range \( 1 \) to \( d \), there are \( 2^{t} \) solutions. But in our case, \( s \) must be in \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \), which is a subset of \( 1 \) to \( d \) (since \( b - 1 = d \)).

Therefore, the number of solutions \( s \) is equal to the number of such pairs \( (k, m) \), which is \( 2^{t} \), but we need to check if each solution \( s \) falls within the required range.

Wait, but this might not always hold because the solutions \( s \) could be outside the range \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \). So, the actual number of valid \( s \) could be less than \( 2^{t} \).

Alternatively, perhaps for each \( d = b - 1 \), the number of solutions \( s \) is equal to the number of divisors of \( d \) that are less than or equal to \( \sqrt{d} \). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. For each","[sqrt(d), '\\sqrt{d}']",211,"[211, '211']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon). Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. The Asymptote code provided draws a dodecagon with some lines and a shaded rectangle, which probably helps visualize the problem.

First, I need to understand the structure of a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees.

Now, the problem is about forming rectangles. A rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be of different lengths. So, I need to figure out how to choose four points (vertices) such that the sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Let me think about how rectangles can be formed in a regular polygon. In a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the sides of the rectangle are either sides of the polygon or diagonals. Since a dodecagon has many diagonals, I need to figure out which combinations of these can form rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of opposite sides or pairs of diagonals that are perpendicular to each other. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, which is divisible by 4, it's possible to have multiple rectangles.

Let me try to visualize the dodecagon. Each vertex is 30 degrees apart. So, if I pick a vertex, the next one is 30 degrees, then 60, 90, and so on. To form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides are parallel if they are separated by a certain number of steps. For example, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, but in a dodecagon, there are more possibilities.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, sides separated by 6 steps are opposite and parallel. Similarly, diagonals can also be parallel if they are separated by the same number of steps. So, for a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel lines, each pair separated by a certain number of steps, and these pairs should be perpendicular to each other.

So, perhaps the key is to find pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that are perpendicular. Each such pair would form the sides of a rectangle.

Let me think about how to count these. Maybe I can consider the different possible distances between parallel sides or diagonals.

In a regular dodecagon, the length of a side is equal to 2*R*sin(π/12), where R is the radius. The diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal that skips one vertex is longer than the side, and so on.

But maybe instead of focusing on lengths, I should focus on the angles. Since a rectangle requires right angles, the sides of the rectangle must be perpendicular. In the dodecagon, two lines are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90 degrees. Since each step is 30 degrees, 90 degrees corresponds to 3 steps (because 3*30=90). So, if I have a side or diagonal that is 3 steps apart, it would be perpendicular to another side or diagonal.

Wait, actually, in terms of vectors, if one vector is at angle θ, another vector at θ + 90 degrees would be perpendicular. So, in the dodecagon, each vertex is at 30-degree increments. So, if I have a line from vertex 0 to vertex k, then a line from vertex 0 to vertex (k + 3) would be 90 degrees apart, since 3*30=90.

Therefore, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of such lines, each pair separated by 3 steps, and each pair perpendicular to the other.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of selecting two pairs of parallel lines, each pair separated by a certain number of steps, and these pairs are perpendicular.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider that in a regular dodecagon, the number of rectangles can be determined by the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that are perpendicular.

In a regular polygon with n sides, the number of rectangles is given by the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular. For a dodecagon, n=12.

But I need to recall the formula or method to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle. Then, the sides and diagonals correspond to chords of the circle. A rectangle inscribed in the circle would have its vertices on the circle, and its sides would be chords. For a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal and the diagonals are equal and bisect each other.

But in this problem, the sides of the rectangle must lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle must coincide with a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

Therefore, each side of the rectangle is a chord of the dodecagon, either a side or a diagonal.

So, to form a rectangle, I need four chords: two pairs of equal and parallel chords, each pair perpendicular to the other.

In a regular dodecagon, the chords can be categorized by the number of vertices they skip. For example, a side skips 1 vertex, a diagonal skipping 2 vertices, up to skipping 5 vertices (since beyond that, it's the same as skipping fewer in the other direction).

So, the possible chord lengths correspond to skipping 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices.

Now, for two chords to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be 90 degrees. Since each step is 30 degrees, the angle between two chords can be a multiple of 30 degrees.

So, if one chord skips k vertices, the angle it makes with the horizontal is 30k degrees. For two chords to be perpendicular, the difference in their angles should be 90 degrees, which is 3 steps (since 3*30=90). So, if one chord skips k vertices, another chord skipping (k + 3) vertices would be perpendicular.

Wait, actually, the angle between two chords is determined by the difference in their step counts. So, if one chord skips m vertices and another skips n vertices, the angle between them is |m - n| * 30 degrees. For them to be perpendicular, |m - n| must be 3, since 3*30=90.

Therefore, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of chords: one pair skipping m vertices, another pair skipping n vertices, such that |m - n| = 3. Additionally, each pair must be parallel, meaning they skip the same number of vertices.

Wait, no. Each pair must be parallel, so each pair skips the same number of vertices. But the two pairs must be perpendicular, so the difference in their skips must be 3.

So, for example, if one pair skips m vertices, the other pair skips m + 3 vertices.

But since the maximum skip is 5 (since beyond that, it's equivalent to skipping fewer in the other direction), m + 3 must be less than or equal to 5. So, m can be 1, 2, or 3.

Wait, let's see:

If m = 1, then n = 4 (since 1 + 3 = 4). But 4 is less than 5, so that's okay.

If m = 2, then n = 5.

If m = 3, then n = 6, but 6 is equivalent to skipping 6 - 12 = -6, which is equivalent to skipping 6 in the other direction, but since 6 is half of 12, it's a diameter. So, skipping 6 is a diameter, which is a straight line.

But in a dodecagon, skipping 6 vertices gives a diameter, which is a straight line, so it's a valid chord.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says ""cada lado do retângulo está em um lado ou em uma diagonal do dodecágono"". So, each side of the rectangle is on a side or a diagonal. So, diameters are considered diagonals, I think.

So, m can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but n = m + 3 must also be a valid skip. So, m can be 1, 2, 3, because:

- m=1, n=4

- m=2, n=5

- m=3, n=6 (diameter)

But m=4 would give n=7, which is equivalent to skipping 7-12= -5, which is equivalent to skipping 5 in the other direction. So, n=7 is equivalent to m=5, but since we already considered m=2, n=5, maybe we don't need to consider m=4.

Similarly, m=5 would give n=8, which is equivalent to skipping 8-12= -4, which is equivalent to skipping 4 in the other direction, which is already considered when m=1, n=4.

So, perhaps m can be 1, 2, 3, each giving a unique pair of perpendicular chord skips.

Therefore, for each m in {1,2,3}, we can form rectangles by choosing two pairs of parallel chords: one pair skipping m vertices, the other skipping m + 3 vertices.

Now, for each such m, how many rectangles can we form?

Let's consider m=1:

- Chords skipping 1 vertex: these are the sides of the dodecagon.

- Chords skipping 4 vertices: these are diagonals that are 4 steps apart.

Since m=1 and n=4, and they are perpendicular.

To form a rectangle, we need two sides (parallel chords skipping 1) and two other sides (parallel chords skipping 4), and they must intersect to form a rectangle.

But how many such rectangles are there?

In a regular dodecagon, the number of rectangles formed by sides skipping m and n vertices is equal to the number of ways to choose two parallel chords for m and two parallel chords for n, such that they intersect.

But actually, in a regular polygon, the number of rectangles formed by two sets of parallel chords is equal to the number of pairs of parallel chords for each set, divided by something? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps for each pair of parallel chords skipping m vertices, and each pair of parallel chords skipping n vertices, if they intersect, they form a rectangle.

But in a regular polygon, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two non-adjacent parallel chords for one direction and two non-adjacent parallel chords for the perpendicular direction.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of selecting two diameters (for m=3, n=6) or something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about how many pairs of parallel chords there are for each skip m.

In a regular dodecagon, for each skip m, the number of parallel chords is 12, but they are grouped into sets of parallel chords. Each set has 12 / gcd(12, m) chords.

Wait, actually, the number of distinct directions for chords skipping m vertices is equal to gcd(12, m). For each direction, there are 12 / gcd(12, m) parallel chords.

Wait, let me recall: in a regular n-gon, the number of distinct directions for chords skipping m vertices is equal to gcd(n, m). Each direction has n / gcd(n, m) chords.

So, for n=12:

- For m=1: gcd(12,1)=1, so 1 direction, 12 chords.

- For m=2: gcd(12,2)=2, so 2 directions, each with 6 chords.

- For m=3: gcd(12,3)=3, so 3 directions, each with 4 chords.

- For m=4: gcd(12,4)=4, so 4 directions, each with 3 chords.

- For m=5: gcd(12,5)=1, so 1 direction, 12 chords.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Actually, in a regular n-gon, the number of distinct directions for chords of step m is equal to gcd(n, m). Each direction corresponds to a different starting point, but due to rotational symmetry, they are equivalent in terms of direction.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that for each m, the number of distinct parallel classes is gcd(n, m). Each class has n / gcd(n, m) chords.

So, for m=1:

- gcd(12,1)=1, so 1 parallel class, with 12 chords.

For m=2:

- gcd(12,2)=2, so 2 parallel classes, each with 6 chords.

For m=3:

- gcd(12,3)=3, so 3 parallel classes, each with 4 chords.

For m=4:

- gcd(12,4)=4, so 4 parallel classes, each with 3 chords.

For m=5:

- gcd(12,5)=1, so 1 parallel class, with 12 chords.

Wait, that makes sense because for m=1, all sides are in the same direction, so 12 chords in one direction.

For m=2, there are two different directions, each with 6 chords.

Similarly, for m=3, three directions, each with 4 chords.

Okay, so now, for each m, we have a certain number of parallel classes, each with a certain number of chords.

Now, to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel chords, one pair from m and another pair from n, where n = m + 3, as we determined earlier.

But wait, actually, n is not necessarily m + 3, but the difference in their steps should be 3 to get a 90-degree angle.

Wait, earlier I thought that if one chord skips m vertices, another skips m + 3, but actually, the angle between them is 30*(m - n) degrees, so to get 90 degrees, |m - n| must be 3.

So, for two chords to be perpendicular, their step differences must be 3.

Therefore, for each m, n can be m + 3 or m - 3, but since m and n are between 1 and 5, we have to adjust.

So, for m=1, n=4 (since 1 + 3=4)

For m=2, n","[2, '2']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the squares of all the numbers in a list. The list has some specific properties: the sum of the numbers is 30, the mode is uniquely 9, and the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what each term means. The sum is straightforward—it's just adding up all the numbers, which equals 30. The mode is the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order, and it's a positive integer that isn't actually in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, especially if the list has an odd number of elements.

So, let me think about the median first. If the median isn't in the list, that suggests that the list has an even number of elements. Because when you have an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If that average is an integer not in the list, then those two middle numbers must be different and their average is an integer. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer not in the list. Wait, but 9 is the mode, so maybe that's a clue.

Wait, no, the median is a positive integer not in the list, but 9 is the mode. So, the median could be something else, like 8 or 10, but not 9. Because if the median were 9, it would have to be in the list, right? Because if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one, which is in the list. But since the median isn't in the list, the list must have an even number of elements, and the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is an integer not in the list.

So, let's denote the number of elements in the list as n. Since the median isn't in the list, n must be even. Let's say n = 2k, where k is an integer. Then, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th terms when the list is sorted. Since the median is an integer not in the list, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer, but neither of them is equal to that integer. So, for example, if the median is 8, the two middle numbers could be 7 and 9, because (7+9)/2 = 8, which is an integer not in the list. But wait, 9 is the mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number. So, if 9 is one of the middle numbers, that might be okay, but the median itself isn't 9.

Wait, but if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is the mode. But the median is 9, which is in the list, right? Because 9 is one of the numbers. But the problem says the median is not in the list. So, that can't be. Therefore, the median can't be 9. So, the median must be another integer, say m, which is not 9, and m is the average of two numbers in the list, which are not equal to m.

So, let's think about possible medians. Let's say the median is 8. Then, the two middle numbers must average to 8, so they could be 7 and 9, or 6 and 10, etc. But since 9 is the mode, it's likely that 9 appears multiple times, so maybe 9 is one of the middle numbers. But if the median is 8, then the two middle numbers can't both be 9, because then the average would be 9, which is the mode, but the median is supposed to be 8, which is not in the list. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the two middle numbers can't both be 9 if the median is 8.

Wait, but if the median is 8, and the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, then 9 is in the list, which is fine because 9 is the mode. But the median is 8, which is not in the list. So, that could work. But then, how many times does 9 appear? It has to be more than any other number. So, let's try to construct such a list.

Let me try to think of a possible list. Let's say n is even, so let's pick n=6 for simplicity. Then, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers. Let's say the list is sorted: a, b, c, d, e, f. The median is (c + d)/2, which is an integer not in the list. Let's say the median is 8, so (c + d)/2 = 8, so c + d = 16. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, let's say 9 appears at least twice. But if c and d are 7 and 9, then 9 appears once in the middle. But maybe 9 appears more times elsewhere.

Wait, let's try to make a list where 9 appears three times. Let's say the list is: 1, 2, 7, 9, 9, 9. Then, the sum is 1+2+7+9+9+9 = 37, which is more than 30. That's too much. So, maybe n=6 is too small. Let's try n=8.

Wait, n=8 would have a median of (4th + 5th)/2. Let's say the median is 8, so (4th + 5th)/2 = 8, so 4th + 5th = 16. Let's try to make 9 appear three times. So, maybe the list is: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 9, 9, x. Wait, but the sum needs to be 30. Let's calculate the sum so far: 1+2+3+7+9+9+9 = 30 + x. Wait, that's already 30 + x, but the total sum should be 30, so x would have to be negative, which isn't allowed because all numbers are positive integers. So, that doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe n=8 is too big. Let's try n=4. Then, the median is (2nd + 3rd)/2. Let's say the median is 8, so 2nd + 3rd = 16. Let's make 9 appear twice. So, the list could be: 1, 7, 9, 9. The sum is 1+7+9+9=26, which is less than 30. We need 4 more. Maybe add another 9? But then n=5, which is odd, and the median would be the 3rd number, which is 9, but the median can't be in the list. So, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe n=5 is possible? If n=5, the median is the 3rd number. But the median can't be in the list, which is impossible because the median is the 3rd number, which is in the list. So, n must be even. So, n=4 is the smallest even number. But in n=4, if the median is 8, then the two middle numbers add up to 16. Let's try to make 9 appear twice. So, the list could be: 1, 7, 9, 9. Sum is 26. We need 4 more. Maybe add another 4? But then the list would be 1,4,7,9,9, which is n=5, which is odd, and the median would be 7, which is in the list. But the median is supposed to be 8, which is not in the list. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe n=6. Let's try n=6 again. Let's say the median is 8, so the 3rd and 4th numbers add up to 16. Let's make 9 appear three times. So, the list could be: 1, 2, 7, 9, 9, 9. Sum is 1+2+7+9+9+9=37, which is too much. We need sum 30, so we need to reduce by 7. Maybe replace some 9s with smaller numbers. But we have to keep 9 as the mode, so it must appear more than any other number.

Alternatively, maybe the median is not 8 but another number. Let's say the median is 7. Then, the two middle numbers add up to 14. Let's try n=6. So, the list is a, b, c, d, e, f. c + d = 14. Let's make 9 appear three times. So, maybe the list is: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 9. Sum is 1+2+6+8+9+9=35, still too much. Need to reduce by 5. Maybe replace 8 with 3: 1,2,6,3,9,9. But then sorted list is 1,2,3,6,9,9. The median is (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, the median has to be an integer, so c + d must be even. So, if the median is 7, c + d=14. Let's try: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 9. Sum is 1+3+6+8+9+9=36. Still too high. Need to reduce by 6. Maybe replace 8 with 2: 1,2,3,6,9,9. Sum is 1+2+3+6+9+9=30. Perfect! Now, let's check the conditions.

List: 1,2,3,6,9,9. Sorted: 1,2,3,6,9,9. Sum is 30. Mode is 9, which appears twice. Wait, but 9 appears twice, and other numbers appear once or twice. Wait, 6 appears once, 3 appears once, 2 appears once, 1 appears once. So, 9 is the mode because it appears twice, and others appear once or twice. Wait, but 6 appears once, 3 appears once, 2 appears once, 1 appears once. So, 9 is the mode because it appears twice, which is more than the others. So, that works.

Now, the median is (3 + 6)/2 = 4.5, which is not an integer. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, this doesn't satisfy the condition. So, this list doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the numbers so that the median is an integer. Let's try again. Let's make c + d = 14, so median is 7. Let's try: 1, 2, 7, 7, 9, 9. Sum is 1+2+7+7+9+9=35. Too high. Need to reduce by 5. Maybe replace one 7 with 2: 1,2,2,7,9,9. Sum is 1+2+2+7+9+9=30. Now, sorted list: 1,2,2,7,9,9. Median is (2 +7)/2=4.5, not integer. Not good.

Alternatively, maybe c + d=16, median=8. Let's try: 1, 2, 7, 9, 9, 9. Sum is 37, too high. Need to reduce by 7. Maybe replace 9s with smaller numbers. Let's try: 1, 2, 7, 9, 9, 2. Sum is 1+2+7+9+9+2=30. Sorted: 1,2,2,7,9,9. Median is (2 +7)/2=4.5, not integer.

Wait, maybe c + d=12, median=6. Let's try: 1, 2, 5,7,9,9. Sum is 1+2+5+7+9+9=33. Need to reduce by 3. Replace 7 with 4: 1,2,4,5,9,9. Sum is 1+2+4+5+9+9=30. Sorted:1,2,4,5,9,9. Median is (4+5)/2=4.5, not integer.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe n=6 is not the right number. Let's try n=8. So, median is (4th +5th)/2. Let's say median is 8, so 4th +5th=16. Let's make 9 appear three times. So, the list could be: 1,2,3,7,9,9,9, x. Sum so far:1+2+3+7+9+9+9=30 +x. Wait, that's 30 +x, but total sum should be 30, so x would have to be 0, which is not positive. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe 9 appears four times. Let's try: 1,2,3,7,9,9,9,9. Sum is 1+2+3+7+9+9+9+9=49, way too high. Need to reduce by 19. That's too much. Maybe n=8 is too big.

Wait, maybe n=5? But n must be even, as the median isn't in the list. So, n=5 is odd, median is in the list, which is not allowed. So, n must be even. Let's try n=4 again. Let's say the list is: 1, 3, 5, 21. Sum is 1+3+5+21=30. But mode is 21, which is unique, but we need mode to be 9. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe n=","[9, '9']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can put a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when I read the numbers from left to right, their sum should be 999, and when I read them from top to bottom, their sum should be 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8 and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. So, reading left to right, the top number is 008, which is 8, and the bottom number is 991, which adds up to 8 + 991 = 999. Reading top to bottom, each column forms the numbers 09, 09, and 81, which are 9, 9, and 81, adding up to 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. 

Alright, so I need to find all such possible grids. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will contain a single digit (0-9). Let me denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the top row is a, b, c and the bottom row is d, e, f. 

Now, when we read the numbers from left to right, the top number is a three-digit number: 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom number is 100d + 10e + f. The sum of these two numbers should be 999. So, mathematically, that gives us the equation:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Similarly, when we read the numbers from top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is 10a + d, the second is 10b + e, and the third is 10c + f. The sum of these three numbers should be 99. So, that gives us another equation:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, now I have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Let me write these equations more clearly:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these equations to find a relationship between the variables.

Let me subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to see what happens.

Equation 1 - Equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99

Simplify the left side:

100a - 10a + 10b - 10b + c - 10c + 100d - d + 10e - e + f - f

Which simplifies to:

90a - 9c + 99d + 9e = 900

I can factor out 9 from each term:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100

So, that's a new equation:

Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100

Okay, so now I have Equation 3 and Equation 2. Maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

Looking at Equation 2:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Let me rearrange this equation:

10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99

Factor out 10 from the first three terms:

10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

So, Equation 2 becomes:

10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let me denote S = a + b + c and T = d + e + f. Then, Equation 2 is:

10*S + T = 99

So, T = 99 - 10*S

Since S and T are sums of digits, each digit is between 0 and 9, so S can range from 0 to 27 (since 3 digits, each up to 9) and T can range from 0 to 27 as well.

But from T = 99 - 10*S, since T must be non-negative, 99 - 10*S >= 0 => S <= 9.9. Since S is an integer, S <= 9.

Similarly, since T must be at least 0, 99 - 10*S >= 0 => S <= 9.

Also, since T is the sum of three digits, T <= 27. So, 99 - 10*S <= 27 => 10*S >= 72 => S >= 7.2. Since S is integer, S >= 8.

So, S must be between 8 and 9 inclusive.

Therefore, S can be 8 or 9.

Case 1: S = 8

Then, T = 99 - 10*8 = 99 - 80 = 19

Case 2: S = 9

Then, T = 99 - 10*9 = 99 - 90 = 9

So, we have two cases: either S=8 and T=19, or S=9 and T=9.

Now, let's consider each case separately.

First, let's handle Case 1: S=8, T=19.

So, a + b + c = 8, and d + e + f = 19.

Also, from Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100

We need to find digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) satisfying these conditions.

Let me note that a, d are digits, so a is from 0 to 9, d is from 0 to 9.

But since a is the first digit of a three-digit number, a can't be 0? Wait, in the example, a was 0. Wait, in the example, the top number was 008, which is 8, so a can be 0. So, a can be 0-9, same with d.

So, a and d can be 0-9.

But let's see Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100

We can rearrange this as:

10a + 11d + e - c = 100

But since a, d, e, c are digits (0-9), let's see the possible ranges.

10a can be 0 to 90

11d can be 0 to 99

e can be 0 to 9

So, 10a + 11d + e can be as low as 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 and as high as 90 + 99 + 9 = 198

But in our case, 10a + 11d + e - c = 100

So, 10a + 11d + e = 100 + c

Since c is a digit (0-9), 100 + c ranges from 100 to 109.

Therefore, 10a + 11d + e must be between 100 and 109.

So, 100 <= 10a + 11d + e <= 109

Given that a, d, e are digits (0-9), let's see what possible values of a, d, e can satisfy this.

Let me think about 10a + 11d + e.

Since 10a is a multiple of 10, 11d is 11 times d, and e is a single digit.

So, 10a + 11d + e = 100 + c, where c is 0-9.

So, 10a + 11d + e must be between 100 and 109.

Let me denote X = 10a + 11d + e.

So, X is between 100 and 109.

Let me think about possible values of d.

Since 11d is part of X, and d is a digit (0-9), 11d can be 0, 11, 22, ..., 99.

So, 11d can be 0, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99.

So, let's consider each possible d and see what a and e would need to be.

Case 1: d = 9

Then, 11d = 99

So, X = 10a + 99 + e

We need X between 100 and 109.

So, 10a + e must be between 1 and 10.

But 10a + e is a two-digit number where a is a digit (0-9) and e is a digit (0-9). So, 10a + e can be from 0 to 99.

But in this case, 10a + e must be between 1 and 10.

So, 10a + e can be 1, 2, ..., 10.

But 10a + e is a two-digit number, so if a=0, e can be 1-10, but e is a digit, so e can be 1-9, but 10a + e=10 would require a=1 and e=0.

Wait, 10a + e can be 10 only if a=1 and e=0.

So, possible (a, e):

If 10a + e = 1: a=0, e=1

Similarly, 2: a=0, e=2

...

10: a=1, e=0

So, for d=9, possible (a, e):

(0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,9), (1,0)

That's 10 possibilities.

But we also have the condition that a + b + c = 8, and d + e + f = 19.

Since d=9, e is known in each case, so f = 19 - d - e = 19 - 9 - e = 10 - e.

But f must be a digit, so 10 - e must be between 0 and 9.

Since e is a digit (0-9), 10 - e is between 1 and 10. But f must be <=9, so 10 - e <=9 => e >=1.

But in our possible (a, e) for d=9, e can be 0 (when a=1, e=0). So, in that case, f=10 - 0=10, which is invalid because f must be a digit (0-9). So, that case is invalid.

Therefore, for d=9, e must be at least 1, so f=10 - e is between 9 and 1, which is valid.

So, for d=9, possible (a, e):

(0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,9). So, 9 possibilities.

Each of these gives f=10 - e, which is valid.

So, for each of these 9 possibilities, we have:

a is 0, e is from 1 to 9, d=9, f=10 - e.

Now, we also have a + b + c =8, with a=0, so b + c=8.

So, b and c are digits (0-9) such that b + c=8.

The number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to b + c=8, which is 9: (0,8), (1,7), ..., (8,0).

So, for each of the 9 possibilities of (a, e), we have 9 possibilities for (b, c). So, total for d=9 is 9*9=81.

But wait, hold on. Let me check if all these satisfy Equation 3.

Wait, Equation 3 is 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

We have a=0, d=9, so 10*0 - c + 11*9 + e = 0 - c + 99 + e = 99 + e - c = 100.

So, 99 + e - c = 100 => e - c = 1 => c = e -1.

But in our earlier setup, for each (a, e), we have c = e -1.

But wait, in the a + b + c =8, with a=0, so b + c=8.

But c = e -1, so b + (e -1) =8 => b =9 - e.

But b must be a digit, so 9 - e must be between 0 and 9.

Since e is from 1 to 9, 9 - e is from 0 to 8, which is valid.

So, for each e from","[8, '8']",45,"[45, '45']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given a system of logarithmic equations. The variables x, y, and z are positive real numbers. The equations are:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

And then, I need to express the result as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers and find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Since all the equations are logarithmic with base 2, maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make it easier to handle. That might help me express x, y, and z in terms of each other or find some relationships between them.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting this to exponential form, it becomes:

x / (y z) = 2^(1/2) = √2.

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting that:

y / (x z) = 2^(1/3).

And the third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. Converting:

z / (x y) = 2^(1/4).

So now I have three equations:

1. x = y z * √2
2. y = x z * 2^(1/3)
3. z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Hmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the other two multiplied by some power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms of a single variable.

Let me try substituting equation 1 into equation 2. From equation 1, x = y z * √2. Plugging this into equation 2:

y = (y z * √2) * z * 2^(1/3)

Simplify that:

y = y z² * √2 * 2^(1/3)

Wait, so y is on both sides. Let me divide both sides by y (since y is positive, it's non-zero):

1 = z² * √2 * 2^(1/3)

So, z² = 1 / (√2 * 2^(1/3)).

Let me compute √2 * 2^(1/3). √2 is 2^(1/2), so multiplying by 2^(1/3) gives 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). Therefore, z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6). So z = 2^(-5/12), since z is positive.

Wait, let me check that exponent. If z² = 2^(-5/6), then z = (2^(-5/6))^(1/2) = 2^(-5/12). Yes, that's correct.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Okay, now that I have z, maybe I can find y and x.

Going back to equation 1: x = y z * √2. Let's express x in terms of y.

But I also have equation 2: y = x z * 2^(1/3). Maybe I can substitute x from equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: x = y z * √2. Plugging into equation 2:

y = (y z * √2) * z * 2^(1/3) = y z² * √2 * 2^(1/3)

Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, since I have z, maybe I can express y in terms of x and then substitute.

Wait, let's see. From equation 2: y = x z * 2^(1/3). Since I know z, I can write y in terms of x.

z = 2^(-5/12), so y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = x * 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = x * 2^(-1/12).

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Okay, so y is x times 2^(-1/12).

Now, going back to equation 1: x = y z * √2. Substitute y:

x = (x * 2^(-1/12)) * z * √2.

We already know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

x = x * 2^(-1/12) * 2^(-5/12) * √2.

Simplify the exponents:

2^(-1/12 -5/12) = 2^(-6/12) = 2^(-1/2) = 1/√2.

So, x = x * (1/√2) * √2.

Wait, (1/√2) * √2 is 1. So x = x * 1, which is x = x. Hmm, that's just an identity, which doesn't help me find x. Maybe I need another equation.

Let me try using equation 3. Equation 3 is z = x y * 2^(1/4). We know z is 2^(-5/12), and y is x * 2^(-1/12). So plug those in:

2^(-5/12) = x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) * 2^(1/4).

Simplify the right side:

x² * 2^(-1/12 + 1/4).

Convert 1/4 to twelfths: 1/4 = 3/12. So exponent is (-1/12 + 3/12) = 2/12 = 1/6.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x² * 2^(1/6).

Therefore, x² = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/6) = 2^(-5/12 - 2/12) = 2^(-7/12).

Thus, x² = 2^(-7/12), so x = 2^(-7/24), since x is positive.

Okay, so x = 2^(-7/24). Then, since y = x * 2^(-1/12), plug in x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8).

So y = 2^(-3/8). And z we already found as 2^(-5/12).

So now, we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute x⁴ y³ z² first.

Expressed in exponents:

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6)

y³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)

So, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Combine the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, let's find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have a common denominator of 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

So total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Both 75 and 24 are divisible by 3: 75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8. So -25/8.

Therefore, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

So log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

Since we're taking the absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime.

Therefore, m =25, n=8, so m +n=33.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, exponents for x, y, z:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)

Wait, hold on, earlier I thought z was 2^(-5/12), which is 2^(-10/24). But when I computed x⁴ y³ z², I used z² as 2^(-5/6). Let me check that.

z = 2^(-5/12), so z² = (2^(-5/12))² = 2^(-5/6). That's correct.

Similarly, x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6). Correct.

y³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8). Correct.

So when multiplying, exponents add:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Convert to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Correct.

So log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8, m +n=33.

I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}
</think>

Given the system of logarithmic equations:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these equations into exponential form:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\)

From these, we express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:

1. \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Substituting \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\) into the second equation:

\[y = (yz \cdot 2^{1/2})z \cdot 2^{1/3}\]
\[y = yz^2 \cdot 2^{1/2 + 1/3}\]
\[1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\]
\[z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\]
\[z = 2^{-5/12}\]

Using \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) in the second equation:

\[y = x \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/3}\]
\[y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\]

Substituting \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\) into the first equation:

\[x = (x \cdot 2^{-1/12}) \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/2}\]
\[x = x \cdot 2^{-1/12 - 5/12 + 6/12}\]
\[x = x \cdot 2^{0}\]
\[x = x\]

Using the third equation with \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) and \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\):

\[2^{-5/12} = x \cdot (x \cdot 2^{-1/12}) \cdot 2^{1/4}\]
\[2^{-5/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12 + 3/12}\]
\[2^{-5/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{2/12}\]
\[x^2 = 2^{-7/12}\]
\[x = 2^{-7/24}\]

Thus, \(y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-9/24} = 2^{-3/8}\).

Now, we compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}\]
\[y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}\]
\[z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}\]

Combining these:

\[x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6}\]

"Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All the opposite sides are parallel. There's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the length of the side of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with all opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in some directions. Since it's equilateral, all sides are equal in length, but the angles might not be equal. But all opposite sides are parallel, so it's a special kind of hexagon.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I think this triangle is called the ""outer triangle"" or something like that. Maybe it's similar to the concept of a triangle formed by extending sides of a hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, I think this triangle might be related to the hexagon in a proportional way. Maybe the sides of the triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon?

Wait, let me think. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, which are three non-consecutive sides, they form a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, these extensions should meet at some points forming a larger triangle.

I remember that in such cases, the sides of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the sides of the hexagon and some ratios. Maybe using similar triangles or something like that.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, each side is length 's'. Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, these extensions will meet at points forming the triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300.

I think the key here is to relate the sides of the triangle to the side length 's' of the hexagon. Maybe using the properties of similar triangles or the ratios of the sides.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since it's a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, I can assign coordinates step by step.

But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I can think about the triangle formed by the extensions. Since the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300, which are multiples of 40: 5*40, 6*40, 7.5*40. Wait, 200 is 5*40, 240 is 6*40, and 300 is 7.5*40. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, 200, 240, 300 can be simplified by dividing by 20: 10, 12, 15. So, the sides are in the ratio 10:12:15.

Wait, maybe the triangle is similar to some triangle related to the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions might be similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to use the concept of similar triangles or homothety.

Wait, another approach: in such a hexagon, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF will form a triangle, and the sides of this triangle can be expressed in terms of the side length 's' and the distances between the sides.

Since opposite sides are parallel, the distance between each pair of opposite sides is constant. Let me denote these distances as 'a', 'b', and 'c' for the three pairs of opposite sides.

But wait, in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the distances between opposite sides can be related to the side length and the angles between the sides.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of the hexagon's side length.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of similar triangles. If I consider the triangle formed by the extensions, each side of this triangle is made up of two sides of the hexagon and some extensions.

Wait, no, actually, each side of the triangle is formed by the extension of one side of the hexagon. So, for example, the side of length 200 is the extension of AB, 240 is the extension of CD, and 300 is the extension of EF.

But how does the extension relate to the side length 's'?

Wait, maybe the sides of the triangle are proportional to the side length 's' times some factor. Let me think.

If I consider the triangle formed by the extensions, each side of the triangle is equal to the side length of the hexagon multiplied by some ratio. Maybe the ratios are related to the angles of the hexagon.

But since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the angles between consecutive sides are equal in pairs. So, each pair of opposite sides are parallel, meaning the angles between them are supplementary.

Wait, maybe I can model the hexagon as a combination of parallelograms or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the triangle's sides being the sum of the hexagon's sides and some extensions.

Wait, let me think about the triangle. Each side of the triangle is formed by extending one side of the hexagon. So, for example, the side of length 200 is formed by extending AB beyond B and A until it meets the extension of CD and EF.

Wait, no, actually, each side of the triangle is formed by the intersection of two extensions. So, the side opposite to the extension of AB is formed by the intersection of the extensions of CD and EF.

Wait, maybe I need to use the concept of similar triangles here. If I can find the ratios of the sides, I can relate them to the side length 's'.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sides of the triangle in terms of the side length of the hexagon.

Wait, I recall that in such a hexagon, the sides of the outer triangle can be expressed as s multiplied by (1 + k), where k is some ratio related to the angles.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to use trigonometry.

Let me try to model the hexagon. Since it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it can be thought of as a combination of three parallelograms.

Wait, no, a hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal is called a parallelogon, but in 2D, only triangles, quadrilaterals, and hexagons can be parallelogons.

Wait, actually, in 2D, a hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal is called a parallelogon, but it's only possible if it's regular or has specific properties.

Wait, but in this case, it's just equilateral, not necessarily regular. So, opposite sides are parallel but not necessarily equal in length? Wait, no, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, but opposite sides are parallel.

So, it's an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's a special case.

I think such a hexagon can be inscribed in a rectangle or something.

Wait, maybe I can model it as a combination of vectors. Let me assign vectors to each side.

Let me denote the sides as vectors. Since it's a hexagon, the sum of the vectors should be zero.

Let me denote the sides as vectors **a**, **b**, **c**, **a**, **b**, **c** in order, since opposite sides are equal and parallel.

Wait, no, in a hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the vectors would be **a**, **b**, **c**, -**a**, -**b**, -**c**. So, the sum is zero.

But since it's equilateral, the magnitudes of **a**, **b**, **c** are equal to 's'.

So, |**a**| = |**b**| = |**c**| = s.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about what these extensions correspond to.

Extending AB would be extending vector **a**, extending CD would be extending vector **c**, and extending EF would be extending vector -**a**.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, AB is the first side, which is vector **a**. CD is the third side, which is vector **c**. EF is the fifth side, which is vector -**a**.

Wait, so the extensions of AB, CD, and EF would correspond to lines in the directions of **a**, **c**, and -**a**.

Wait, but how do these lines form a triangle? Maybe the triangle is formed by the intersections of these extended lines.

So, the lines extended from AB, CD, and EF intersect to form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

I think I need to find the relationship between the side length 's' and the sides of this triangle.

Maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles or the ratios of the sides.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sides of the triangle in terms of the side length 's' and the angles between the sides.

Wait, since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the angles between consecutive sides are equal in pairs.

Let me denote the angles between **a** and **b** as θ, between **b** and **c** as φ, and so on.

But since opposite sides are parallel, the angles on the opposite sides are equal. So, the angle between **a** and **b** is equal to the angle between -**a** and -**b**, which is the same as θ.

Similarly, the angle between **b** and **c** is φ, and the angle between -**b** and -**c** is also φ.

Wait, but in a hexagon, the sum of the internal angles is (6-2)*180 = 720 degrees. So, each pair of angles θ, φ, and another angle would sum up to 720/3 = 240 degrees? Wait, no, because in a hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees if it's regular, but this is not regular.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the triangle formed by the extensions.

Each side of the triangle is formed by the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon.

So, for example, one side of the triangle is formed by the intersection of the extension of AB and the extension of CD.

Similarly, another side is formed by the intersection of the extension of CD and the extension of EF, and the third side by the intersection of the extension of EF and the extension of AB.

So, each side of the triangle is the distance between two lines extended from the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe I can model this using the formula for the distance between two parallel lines, but in this case, the lines are not parallel, they intersect.

Wait, no, the sides AB, CD, EF are not necessarily parallel to each other. Wait, in the hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, so AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, so AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

So, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, these are three non-parallel lines, so they form a triangle.

Wait, but AB is parallel to DE, CD is parallel to FA, and EF is parallel to BC.

So, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF are not parallel to each other, so they intersect to form a triangle.

Now, the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

I think I can use the concept of similar triangles here. Maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sides of the triangle in terms of the side length 's' and the angles between the sides.

Wait, perhaps I can use the law of sines or cosines in the triangle.

But I need more information about the angles.

Wait, maybe I can relate the sides of the triangle to the side length 's' using the ratios of the sides.

Wait, let me think about the triangle. The sides are 200, 240, 300. Let me check if this is a right triangle.

200^2 + 240^2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600

300^2 = 90000

No, 97600 ≠ 90000, so it's not a right triangle.

Wait, but 200, 240, 300 can be simplified by dividing by 20: 10, 12, 15.

So, the sides are in the ratio 10:12:15.

Hmm, maybe the side length 's' is related to these ratios.

Wait, perhaps the sides of the triangle are proportional to the side length 's' times some factor.

Wait, maybe the sides of the triangle are equal to s multiplied by (1 + k), where k is some ratio related to the angles.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to use the concept of similar triangles.

Wait, another approach: in such a hexagon, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the sides of the triangle in terms of the side length 's' and the angles between the sides.

Let me denote the angles between the sides of the hexagon as α, β, γ, etc.

But since opposite sides are parallel, the angles are supplementary in pairs.

Wait, for example, the angle between AB and BC is equal to the angle between DE and EF, and so on.

Wait, maybe I can model the hexagon as a combination of three parallelograms.

Wait, no, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the triangle's sides being the sum of the hexagon's sides and some extensions.

Wait, let me think about the triangle. Each side of the triangle is formed by the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon.

So, for example, the side opposite to the extension of AB is formed by the intersection of the extensions of CD and EF.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the distance between two lines.

Wait, but the lines are not parallel, so the distance is not constant. Instead, they intersect at","[10, '10']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all the finite non-empty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, let me try to understand this step by step. So, Alice picks a set A, which is a collection of positive integers. Then Bob is creating all possible non-empty finite sets B where the maximum number in B is one of the numbers in A. The total number of these sets B is 2024, and from that, I have to figure out what A is and then sum its elements.

First, let me think about how Bob is generating these sets B. For each element a in A, Bob is considering all possible subsets where the maximum element is a. So, for each a in A, the number of such subsets B is equal to the number of subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a-1} because any subset of these numbers combined with a will have a as the maximum. Since each of these subsets can either include or exclude each element from 1 to a-1, the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, for each a in A, there are 2^{a-1} subsets B where the maximum element is a. Since these subsets are disjoint for different a's (because each B has a unique maximum), the total number of such subsets is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

So, the total number of sets B is equal to the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A. According to the problem, this sum is 2024. Therefore, we have:

Sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024

So, I need to find a set A of positive integers such that when I take each element a, compute 2^{a - 1}, and sum all those up, I get 2024. Then, once I find such a set A, I can sum its elements to get the answer.

Now, 2024 is a specific number, so maybe I can express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. Since 2^{a - 1} are powers of 2, this seems like a binary representation problem.

Let me recall that any integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2. So, if I can write 2024 in binary, the positions of the 1s will correspond to the exponents in the powers of 2, which in turn will give me the elements of A.

Wait, let me think again. If 2024 is equal to the sum of 2^{a - 1} for a in A, then each term 2^{a - 1} is a power of 2. So, 2024 must be equal to the sum of distinct powers of 2, each corresponding to an element a in A.

Therefore, if I write 2024 in binary, each bit that is set to 1 will correspond to a term 2^{k}, which would mean that a - 1 = k, so a = k + 1. Therefore, the elements of A are the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of 2024, incremented by 1.

Wait, let me verify that. Let's take an example. Suppose A = {1, 2}. Then the total number of sets B would be 2^{0} + 2^{1} = 1 + 2 = 3. Indeed, the sets B would be {1}, {2}, and {1,2}. So, that works.

Similarly, if A = {3}, then the number of sets B is 2^{2} = 4, which are {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. So, that also works.

Therefore, in general, the number of sets B is the sum over a in A of 2^{a - 1}, which is equal to 2024. So, to find A, I need to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, each of the form 2^{a - 1}, which would correspond to the binary representation of 2024.

So, let's convert 2024 into binary. To do that, I can divide 2024 by 2 repeatedly and note the remainders.

2024 divided by 2 is 1012, remainder 0.

1012 divided by 2 is 506, remainder 0.

506 divided by 2 is 253, remainder 0.

253 divided by 2 is 126, remainder 1.

126 divided by 2 is 63, remainder 0.

63 divided by 2 is 31, remainder 1.

31 divided by 2 is 15, remainder 1.

15 divided by 2 is 7, remainder 1.

7 divided by 2 is 3, remainder 1.

3 divided by 2 is 1, remainder 1.

1 divided by 2 is 0, remainder 1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first, 2024 in binary is 11111101000.

Let me verify that:

11111101000 is:

1*2^10 + 1*2^9 + 1*2^8 + 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0

Calculating:

2^10 = 1024

2^9 = 512

2^8 = 256

2^7 = 128

2^6 = 64

2^5 = 32

2^3 = 8

Adding these up: 1024 + 512 = 1536; 1536 + 256 = 1792; 1792 + 128 = 1920; 1920 + 64 = 1984; 1984 + 32 = 2016; 2016 + 8 = 2024. Yes, that's correct.

So, the binary representation is 11111101000, which has 1s at positions 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3 (counting from the right, starting at 0). Wait, actually, in binary, the rightmost digit is position 0. So, let's count the positions:

Starting from the right:

Position 0: 0

Position 1: 0

Position 2: 0

Position 3: 1

Position 4: 0

Position 5: 1

Position 6: 1

Position 7: 1

Position 8: 1

Position 9: 1

Position 10: 1

So, the 1s are at positions 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

Therefore, each of these corresponds to 2^{k} where k is the position. But in our problem, each term is 2^{a - 1}, so 2^{a - 1} = 2^{k} implies that a - 1 = k, so a = k + 1.

Therefore, the elements of A are k + 1 where k is the position of the 1s in the binary representation.

So, the positions with 1s are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10. Therefore, the elements of A are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, let me check:

Position 3: a = 4

Position 5: a = 6

Position 6: a =7

Position7: a=8

Position8: a=9

Position9: a=10

Position10: a=11

Yes, that seems correct.

So, A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}

Now, the problem asks for the sum of the elements of A.

So, let's compute 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11.

Let me add them step by step:

4 + 6 = 10

10 + 7 = 17

17 + 8 = 25

25 + 9 = 34

34 + 10 = 44

44 + 11 = 55

So, the sum is 55.

Wait, let me verify that addition again:

4 + 6 = 10

10 + 7 = 17

17 + 8 = 25

25 + 9 = 34

34 + 10 = 44

44 + 11 = 55

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me double-check the binary representation and the positions.

2024 in binary is 11111101000.

Breaking it down:

From right to left:

Position 0: 0

Position 1: 0

Position 2: 0

Position 3: 1

Position 4: 0

Position 5: 1

Position 6: 1

Position 7: 1

Position 8: 1

Position 9: 1

Position 10: 1

So, positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10 have 1s. Therefore, a = 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of subsets B is equal to the sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, 2024 is equal to 2^{11} - 2^{3} because 2048 - 32 = 2016, but wait, 2024 is 2016 + 8, which is 2024. Wait, maybe that's another way to express it.

Wait, 2024 is 2048 - 24, but 24 is 16 + 8, so 2024 = 2048 - 16 - 8 = 2^{11} - 2^4 - 2^3.

But in our case, the sum is 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Which is 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 2024.

Yes, that's correct.

So, each term corresponds to a in A as a = exponent + 1.

So, exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, so a = 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, hold on, that's different from before. Wait, no, because in the binary representation, the exponents correspond to the positions, which are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, maybe I confused the exponents.

Wait, 2^{10} is 1024, which is the leftmost bit, which is position 10.

But in the binary number, the leftmost digit is the highest power.

So, in the binary number 11111101000, the leftmost 1 is at position 10, then 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and then the next 1 is at position 3.

So, the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, a = exponent + 1, so a = 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in assigning the positions.

Wait, in the binary number, the rightmost digit is position 0, so the leftmost digit is position 10.

So, the binary number is:

Position 10: 1

Position 9: 1

Position 8: 1

Position 7: 1

Position 6: 1

Position 5: 1

Position 4: 0

Position 3: 1

Position 2: 0

Position 1: 0

Position 0: 0

So, the 1s are at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, a = exponent + 1, so a = 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, so that's different from my initial thought where I thought a was 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, in the problem, the number of subsets B is the sum over a in A of 2^{a - 1}.

So, if a is 11, then 2^{10} is the number of subsets where the maximum is 11.

Similarly, a=10 gives 2^9, and so on.

So, in the binary representation, each 1 corresponds to 2^{k}, which is equal to 2^{a - 1}, so a = k + 1.

But in the binary number, the positions are exponents, so if a bit is set at position k, that corresponds to 2^{k}, which is 2^{a - 1}, so a = k + 1.

But in the binary number, the leftmost bit is the highest exponent, which is","[1, '1']",55,"[55, '55']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest four-digit positive integer N. The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q and R, which are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, and then compute Q + R.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number should be divisible by 7. That means there are four different numbers to check for divisibility by 7: changing the thousands digit, hundreds digit, tens digit, or units digit to 1.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A ≠ 0. So, the four numbers we get by changing each digit to 1 are:

1. 1BCD (changing A to 1)
2. A1CD (changing B to 1)
3. AB1D (changing C to 1)
4. ABC1 (changing D to 1)

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four numbers, when divided by 7, the remainder should be 0.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can express each of these numbers in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Wait, let's express N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then, changing A to 1 gives 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, changing B to 1 gives 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Changing C to 1 gives 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Changing D to 1 gives 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Therefore, we have four congruences:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But N itself is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, so let's denote N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, the four conditions can be rewritten in terms of N:

1. (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7
   But 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A)
   Wait, because N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, so 100B + 10C + D = N - 1000A
   So, 1000 + (N - 1000A) ≡ 0 mod 7
   Which simplifies to N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, N + (1000 - 1000A) ≡ 0 mod 7

Similarly, let's do this for each condition.

1. Changing A to 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
   As above, this is N - 1000A + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, N ≡ 1000A - 1000 mod 7

2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
   Similarly, 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = N - 100B + 100
   So, N - 100B + 100 ≡ 0 mod 7
   Therefore, N ≡ 100B - 100 mod 7

3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
   Which is N - 10C + 10 ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, N ≡ 10C - 10 mod 7

4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
   Which is N - D + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, N ≡ D - 1 mod 7

So, now we have four congruences:

1. N ≡ 1000A - 1000 mod 7
2. N ≡ 100B - 100 mod 7
3. N ≡ 10C - 10 mod 7
4. N ≡ D - 1 mod 7

So, all four expressions on the right must be congruent modulo 7. Therefore, they must all be equal modulo 7.

So, 1000A - 1000 ≡ 100B - 100 ≡ 10C - 10 ≡ D - 1 mod 7.

Let me compute each coefficient modulo 7 to simplify.

First, compute 1000 mod 7.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 /7=14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

So, let's rewrite each congruence:

1. 1000A - 1000 ≡ 6A - 6 mod 7
2. 100B - 100 ≡ 2B - 2 mod 7
3. 10C - 10 ≡ 3C - 3 mod 7
4. D - 1 mod 7

So, all four expressions must be congruent modulo 7:

6A - 6 ≡ 2B - 2 ≡ 3C - 3 ≡ D - 1 mod 7.

Let me denote this common value as k mod 7. So,

6A - 6 ≡ k mod 7

2B - 2 ≡ k mod 7

3C - 3 ≡ k mod 7

D - 1 ≡ k mod 7

So, each of these expressions equals k mod 7.

Therefore, we can write:

6A ≡ k + 6 mod 7

2B ≡ k + 2 mod 7

3C ≡ k + 3 mod 7

D ≡ k + 1 mod 7

So, let's solve for each digit:

From 6A ≡ k + 6 mod 7:

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod 7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse of 6 is 6.

Thus, A ≡ 6*(k + 6) mod7

Similarly, for 2B ≡ k + 2 mod7:

Inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, B ≡ 4*(k + 2) mod7

For 3C ≡ k + 3 mod7:

Inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, C ≡5*(k + 3) mod7

And D ≡k +1 mod7

So, now, A, B, C, D are digits, so they must be integers between 0 and 9 (with A ≠0). So, we can write:

A ≡6(k +6) mod7

B ≡4(k +2) mod7

C ≡5(k +3) mod7

D ≡k +1 mod7

But since A, B, C, D are digits, their values are determined modulo7, but they can be in 0-9, so we can have multiple possibilities.

But since we are looking for the largest N, which is ABCD, we need to maximize A, then B, then C, then D.

So, perhaps we can find k such that A is as large as possible, then B, etc.

But k is a value mod7, so k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, let's consider k from 0 to6 and see what digits A,B,C,D would be.

But since N is the largest possible, we need to maximize A, so A should be as large as possible, preferably 9.

But A is a digit, so A can be 9,8,...,1.

But A ≡6(k +6) mod7.

So, let's compute 6(k +6) mod7 for k=0 to6:

For k=0: 6*(0+6)=36≡1 mod7

k=1:6*(1+6)=42≡0 mod7

k=2:6*(2+6)=48≡6 mod7

k=3:6*(3+6)=54≡5 mod7

k=4:6*(4+6)=60≡4 mod7

k=5:6*(5+6)=66≡3 mod7

k=6:6*(6+6)=72≡2 mod7

So, A ≡ [1,0,6,5,4,3,2] for k=0 to6.

But A is a digit from1 to9, so A must be congruent to one of these mod7, but also as large as possible.

So, for each k, A can be the maximum digit (from9 down) that is ≡ to the above value mod7.

Similarly, for each k, let's compute possible A, B, C, D.

But this might take a while, but let's try.

Our goal is to find the largest N, so we need the largest possible A, then B, etc.

So, let's try k=0 first:

k=0:

A ≡1 mod7. So, A can be 1,8. Since we want the largest, A=8.

B ≡4*(0 +2)=8≡1 mod7. So, B can be 1,8. Choose B=8.

C ≡5*(0 +3)=15≡1 mod7. So, C can be 1,8. Choose C=8.

D ≡0 +1=1 mod7. So, D=1,8. Choose D=8.

So, N would be 8888. But wait, let's check if this satisfies the original condition.

Wait, but N=8888. Let's check if changing any digit to1 makes it divisible by7.

Change A to1: 1888. 1888 /7=269.714... Not integer. So, 1888 mod7: 1888 -7*269=1888-1883=5. So, 5≠0. So, 1888 not divisible by7. So, k=0 is invalid.

So, k=0 doesn't work.

Next, k=1:

A ≡0 mod7. So, A can be 0 or7. But A≠0, so A=7.

B ≡4*(1 +2)=12≡5 mod7. So, B can be5,12 invalid. So, B=5.

C ≡5*(1 +3)=20≡6 mod7. So, C=6,13 invalid. So, C=6.

D ≡1 +1=2 mod7. So, D=2,9. Choose D=9.

So, N=7569.

Check if changing any digit to1 makes it divisible by7.

Change A to1:1569. 1569 /7=224.142... 1569 mod7: 1569 -7*224=1569-1568=1≠0. So, invalid.

So, k=1 doesn't work.

k=2:

A ≡6 mod7. So, A=6,13 invalid. So, A=6.

B ≡4*(2 +2)=16≡2 mod7. So, B=2,9. Choose B=9.

C ≡5*(2 +3)=25≡4 mod7. So, C=4,11 invalid. So, C=4.

D ≡2 +1=3 mod7. So, D=3,10 invalid. So, D=3.

So, N=6943.

Check changing A to1:1943. 1943 /7=277.571... 1943 mod7: 1943 -7*277=1943-1939=4≠0. So, invalid.

k=2 doesn't work.

k=3:

A ≡5 mod7. So, A=5,","[5, '5']",699,"[699, '699']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. The torus T is created by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis in its plane, which is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11. 

The problem says that when the torus T is resting on the outside of the sphere S, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Similarly, when T is resting on the inside of S, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be described by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

So, R = 6, r = 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, it's externally tangent. Similarly, when it's resting on the inside, it's also externally tangent. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think.

When the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus, right? So, the torus is larger, and the sphere is inside it, touching along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the torus is inside the sphere, touching along another circle.

Wait, but the problem says ""externally tangent"" in both cases. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. If the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, then the sphere is inside the torus, and the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the sphere is outside the torus, and the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. So, in both cases, the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, but in one case, the sphere is inside the torus, and in the other, it's outside.

Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. If the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, that probably means the torus is outside the sphere, touching it. Similarly, resting on the inside would mean the torus is inside the sphere, touching it. So, in both cases, the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, but in one case, it's outside, and in the other, it's inside.

So, in the first case, the torus is outside the sphere, so the distance between their centers would be equal to the sum of their radii? Wait, no, because the torus isn't a sphere. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Maybe I should model the torus and the sphere in a coordinate system. Let's place the center of the sphere at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the torus can be placed such that its center is along the z-axis, say at (0,0,d), where d is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus.

Wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution, so it's symmetric around its axis. So, if we place the torus such that its axis is along the z-axis, then the center of the torus is at (0,0,d). The sphere is centered at (0,0,0) with radius 11.

Now, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on whether they are externally or internally tangent. But since the torus is a more complex shape, maybe I need to think about the closest and farthest points.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the cross-section. If I take a cross-sectional view of the torus and the sphere, it might simplify things. The cross-section of a torus is a circle with radius R (major radius) and the tube radius r. So, in cross-section, the torus would look like a circle of radius R = 6, with a tube radius r = 3.

Similarly, the sphere in cross-section is a circle with radius 11. So, in 2D, we have two circles: one with radius 11 (the sphere) and another with radius 6 (the center of the torus), and the torus itself has a tube radius of 3.

Wait, no. Actually, in cross-section, the torus would look like two circles: one with radius R + r = 6 + 3 = 9 and another with radius R - r = 6 - 3 = 3. So, the cross-section of the torus is an annulus with inner radius 3 and outer radius 9.

So, in 2D, the sphere is a circle of radius 11, and the torus is an annulus with inner radius 3 and outer radius 9. Now, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers will determine whether the sphere is inside or outside the torus.

Wait, maybe I should think about the distance between the centers. Let me denote the center of the sphere as O and the center of the torus as C. The distance between O and C is D.

When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance D must satisfy certain conditions. If the torus is outside the sphere, then the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center would be along the line connecting O and C. Similarly, if the torus is inside the sphere, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center would be along that line.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the concept of the distance between the centers and the radii to find the tangent circles.

Let me try to formalize this. The torus can be considered as the set of points at a distance R from the center C, and then each point on that circle is the center of a circle of radius r. So, in 3D, the torus is all points (x,y,z) such that sqrt((sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2) = r.

But maybe in cross-section, it's easier. So, in the cross-sectional plane, the torus is an annulus with inner radius R - r = 3 and outer radius R + r = 9.

So, in 2D, the sphere is a circle of radius 11, and the torus is an annulus with inner radius 3 and outer radius 9. Now, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers D must satisfy that the sphere touches the torus at exactly one point (or along a circle in 3D). 

Wait, but in cross-section, it's a circle tangent to an annulus. So, if the sphere is outside the torus, the distance D would be equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's outer radius. Similarly, if the sphere is inside the torus, the distance D would be equal to the difference between the sphere's radius and the torus's inner radius.

Wait, let me think. If the sphere is outside the torus, then the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is at a distance of D - 11, and this should equal the torus's outer radius. Wait, no, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, if the sphere is outside the torus, the distance between centers D should be equal to the sphere's radius plus the torus's outer radius. So, D = 11 + 9 = 20. Similarly, if the sphere is inside the torus, the distance D should be equal to the sphere's radius minus the torus's inner radius, so D = 11 - 3 = 8.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says when T is resting on the outside of S, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when resting on the inside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. So, in both cases, the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, but in one case, it's outside, and in the other, it's inside.

So, in the first case, when the torus is outside the sphere, the distance between centers D is 11 + 9 = 20. In the second case, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance D is 11 - 3 = 8.

Wait, but in the problem, it's the torus that is resting on the sphere, so maybe the distance D is different. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance D is such that the sphere is tangent to the torus. So, in the case where the torus is outside the sphere, the distance D is equal to the sphere's radius plus the torus's outer radius. Similarly, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance D is equal to the sphere's radius minus the torus's inner radius.

But let me verify this. If the sphere is outside the torus, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is at a distance of D - 11, which should equal the torus's outer radius, 9. So, D - 11 = 9 => D = 20. Similarly, if the sphere is inside the torus, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center is at a distance of D + 11, which should equal the torus's inner radius, 3. Wait, that doesn't make sense because D + 11 = 3 would give D = -8, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe I have it backwards. If the sphere is inside the torus, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is D, and the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center would be D + 9, which should equal the sphere's radius, 11. So, D + 9 = 11 => D = 2. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is D - 9, which should equal the sphere's radius, 11. So, D - 9 = 11 => D = 20.

Wait, that seems more consistent. So, when the torus is outside the sphere, the distance between centers is 20, and when it's inside, the distance is 2.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says ""when T repousa na parte externa de S"" which translates to ""when T rests on the outside of S"", meaning the torus is outside the sphere, and ""repousa na parte interna de S"" meaning the torus is inside the sphere.

So, in both cases, the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. So, in the first case, the distance between centers is 20, and in the second case, it's 2.

Now, the problem is asking for the radii r_i and r_o of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in each case. So, when the torus is outside the sphere, the tangent circle has radius r_i, and when it's inside, it's r_o. Then, we need to find r_i - r_o.

So, how do we find these radii?

I think we can model this in cross-section. In the cross-sectional view, the sphere is a circle of radius 11, and the torus is an annulus with inner radius 3 and outer radius 9. The centers are separated by D, which is 20 when the torus is outside and 2 when it's inside.

In each case, the tangent circle corresponds to the intersection of the sphere and the torus. In cross-section, this would be the intersection of two circles: the sphere and the torus's cross-section.

Wait, but in cross-section, the torus is an annulus, so the intersection would be a circle. The radius of this circle in 3D would correspond to the radius of the tangent circle.

Wait, maybe I should think about the cross-sectional circles. When the torus is outside the sphere, the cross-section is a circle of radius 9 (the outer radius of the torus) and the sphere is a circle of radius 11. The distance between their centers is 20.

Similarly, when the torus is inside the sphere, the cross-section is a circle of radius 3 (the inner radius of the torus) and the sphere is a circle of radius 11, with centers separated by 2.

So, in both cases, we have two circles: one with radius 11 and another with radius either 9 or 3, separated by a distance D of 20 or 2, respectively. The intersection of these two circles will form a lens shape, and the points of intersection will lie on a circle whose radius we can compute.

Wait, but in 3D, the intersection of the sphere and the torus is a circle. The radius of this circle can be found using the formula for the intersection of two spheres. Wait, but in this case, one is a sphere and the other is a torus, so maybe it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the cross-sectional circles and find the radius of their intersection.

Let me consider the case when the torus is outside the sphere first. So, in cross-section, we have two circles: one with radius 11 centered at (0,0), and another with radius 9 centered at (20,0). The intersection points will form a circle whose radius we can find.

Wait, no, in cross-section, the intersection points would be two points, not a circle. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps in 3D, the intersection of the sphere and the torus is a circle. The radius of this circle can be found by considering the distance between the centers and the radii of the sphere and the torus.

Wait, let me recall that the radius of the intersection circle can be found using the formula for the intersection of two spheres. But in this case, one is a sphere and the other is a torus, so it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the torus and the sphere and find their intersection.

The equation of the sphere is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

The equation of the torus is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r², where R = 6 and r = 3. So, (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place some white and black chips on a 5x5 grid. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, all chips in the same column must be the same color, and adding any more chips would violate these conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me understand the constraints. Each row can have chips of only one color, and each column can also have chips of only one color. So, if I have a row with white chips, all the chips in that row must be white, and similarly for black. The same goes for columns. Also, the grid is 5x5, so there are 25 cells. I have 25 white and 25 black chips, but I don't have to use all of them. The key is that after placing the chips, I can't add any more without breaking the rules.

So, essentially, I need to place chips in such a way that every row and every column is either all white, all black, or empty. But wait, no, actually, each row and column can have chips of only one color, but they don't have to be filled entirely. So, for example, a row could have some white chips, but not necessarily all. But wait, no, hold on. The problem says ""todas as fichas na mesma linha e todas as fichas na mesma coluna tenham a mesma cor."" So, all the chips in the same row must be the same color, and all the chips in the same column must be the same color. So, if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color, and similarly for columns.

So, each row is either empty or filled with chips of one color, and each column is either empty or filled with chips of one color. But also, the placement must be such that you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, the placement is maximal in some sense.

Wait, so if I have a row that's partially filled, but not completely, then I could potentially add more chips to that row without changing the color, right? But the condition says that adding any more chips would violate the conditions. So, that means that every row and every column that has at least one chip must be completely filled with chips of that color. Because otherwise, you could add more chips to that row or column without changing the color, which would violate the maximality condition.

So, in other words, each row is either completely filled with white, completely filled with black, or empty. Similarly, each column is either completely filled with white, completely filled with black, or empty. But wait, that can't be entirely true because if a row is completely filled with white, then all the columns intersecting that row must also be either completely white or empty. Because if a column intersects a white row, and that column is supposed to have all chips of the same color, but if the column is not entirely white, then it must be entirely black or empty. But if the column is entirely black, that would conflict with the white row. So, actually, if a row is white, then all columns intersecting that row must be white or empty. Similarly, if a column is white, all rows intersecting it must be white or empty.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think of the grid as being partitioned into white and black regions, where each white region is a rectangle (since all rows and columns in that region are white), and similarly for black. But since the grid is 5x5, maybe the white and black regions can be rectangles that don't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire grid is divided into some white rectangles and some black rectangles, such that no two rectangles overlap, and every cell is either in a white rectangle, a black rectangle, or empty. But since the grid is 5x5, and each rectangle must cover entire rows or columns, maybe the white and black regions are unions of full rows and full columns.

Wait, no, because if a row is white, then all the columns intersecting it must be white or empty. So, if I have a white row, then all the columns that have any white chips must be entirely white. Similarly, if I have a black row, all the columns that have any black chips must be entirely black. So, actually, the white and black regions must form rectangles that cover entire rows and columns.

Wait, maybe the entire grid is covered by some white rectangles and some black rectangles, but each rectangle must cover entire rows and columns. So, for example, if I have a white rectangle covering rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, then rows 1-2 must be entirely white in columns 1-3, and columns 1-3 must be entirely white in rows 1-2. But that might not necessarily cover the entire grid, but in this problem, the grid can have empty cells as well.

But given that the placement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions, that implies that every empty cell is adjacent (in some sense) to both a white and a black region, making it impossible to color it without conflicting with one of the regions.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the grid as being covered by white and black rectangles, where each rectangle is a set of full rows and full columns. So, for example, if I have a white rectangle covering rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, then all cells in rows 1-2 and columns 1-3 are white. Similarly, a black rectangle could cover rows 3-5 and columns 4-5, making those cells black. The remaining cells would be empty.

But in this case, the white and black regions must not overlap, and every cell is either white, black, or empty. Also, the placement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, in this case, every empty cell is adjacent (in terms of row or column) to both a white and a black region, making it impossible to color it without conflicting with one of the regions.

Wait, maybe it's simpler. Since each row and column must be monochromatic or empty, and the placement is maximal, that means that for every empty row, all the columns intersecting it must be entirely black or entirely white. Similarly, for every empty column, all the rows intersecting it must be entirely black or entirely white.

Wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think again.

Suppose I have some rows colored white, some rows colored black, and some rows empty. Similarly for columns. But the key is that if a row is empty, then all the columns that intersect it must be entirely white or entirely black. Because otherwise, if a column intersecting an empty row has both white and black chips, then you could potentially add a chip of the same color as the column to that empty cell without violating the color condition. But since the placement is maximal, you can't do that. Therefore, every column that intersects an empty row must be entirely white or entirely black.

Similarly, every row that intersects an empty column must be entirely white or entirely black.

So, in other words, the empty rows and empty columns must be such that all columns intersecting an empty row are monochromatic, and all rows intersecting an empty column are monochromatic.

This seems like a system of constraints. Maybe the grid can be partitioned into white, black, and empty regions, where the empty regions are such that every row or column containing an empty cell is entirely monochromatic.

Wait, perhaps the grid can be divided into four regions: white, black, and two types of empty regions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the grid can be represented as a bipartition of rows and columns into white and black, with the empty cells being where the white rows and black columns intersect, or something like that.

Wait, let's think of it this way: Let me denote W as a white row, B as a black row, and E as an empty row. Similarly, for columns: W, B, E.

But the problem is that the color of a row affects the possible colors of the columns, and vice versa.

Suppose I have some rows colored white, some colored black, and some empty. Similarly for columns. But the key is that if a row is white, then all columns intersecting it must be either white or empty. Similarly, if a column is white, all rows intersecting it must be white or empty.

Wait, that seems like a key point. So, if a row is white, then all columns that have any white chips must be entirely white. Similarly, if a column is white, all rows that have any white chips must be entirely white.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. If a row is white, then all the columns that intersect it must be either entirely white or entirely empty. Because if a column intersects a white row, and that column has any chips, they must all be white. Similarly, if a column is white, all the rows intersecting it must be entirely white or entirely empty.

So, in other words, the white rows and white columns form a rectangle. Similarly, the black rows and black columns form another rectangle. The empty cells are outside these rectangles.

But since the grid is 5x5, the white and black regions must be rectangles that don't overlap, and their union can't exceed the grid.

Wait, but the white and black regions can be overlapping? No, because if a cell is white, it can't be black, and vice versa. So, the white and black regions must be disjoint.

Therefore, the grid is divided into three parts: white rectangle, black rectangle, and empty cells. The white rectangle is formed by some set of white rows and white columns, and the black rectangle is formed by some set of black rows and black columns, such that the white and black rectangles don't overlap.

But wait, actually, the white and black regions can be more complex than just rectangles. For example, you could have multiple white rectangles and multiple black rectangles, as long as they don't overlap. But given the maximality condition, I think it's more constrained.

Wait, no, because if you have multiple white rectangles, say two separate white rectangles, then the columns between them could potentially be colored without conflicting, but since the placement is maximal, that might not be possible.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the entire grid being covered by white and black rectangles, with the rest being empty, and these rectangles cannot overlap.

But let's try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Let R_w be the set of white rows.

- Let C_w be the set of white columns.

Similarly, R_b for black rows, and C_b for black columns.

Then, the white region is the intersection of R_w and C_w, i.e., all cells (i,j) where i is in R_w and j is in C_w.

Similarly, the black region is the intersection of R_b and C_b.

But since the white and black regions cannot overlap, we must have that R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint.

Wait, no, actually, R_w and R_b can overlap, but their intersections with C_w and C_b must not overlap. So, if a row is in both R_w and R_b, then the columns in C_w and C_b must not overlap in such a way that the cell (i,j) is both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, R_w and R_b must be disjoint, and C_w and C_b must be disjoint.

Therefore, the rows are partitioned into R_w, R_b, and R_e (empty rows). Similarly, columns are partitioned into C_w, C_b, and C_e (empty columns).

But wait, no, because a row can be in R_w, R_b, or R_e, but if a row is in R_w, then all columns intersecting it must be in C_w or C_e. Similarly, if a row is in R_b, all columns intersecting it must be in C_b or C_e.

Similarly, for columns: if a column is in C_w, all rows intersecting it must be in R_w or R_e. If a column is in C_b, all rows intersecting it must be in R_b or R_e.

Therefore, the structure is such that:

- R_w is a set of rows, and C_w is a set of columns, such that all cells in R_w x C_w are white.

- R_b is a set of rows, and C_b is a set of columns, such that all cells in R_b x C_b are black.

- The remaining cells (R_e x C_e) are empty.

But also, R_w and R_b must be disjoint, and C_w and C_b must be disjoint, because otherwise, if a row is in both R_w and R_b, then the columns in C_w and C_b would have conflicting colors.

Therefore, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. R_w x C_w: white.

2. R_b x C_b: black.

3. R_w x C_b: empty, because if a row is in R_w, the columns in C_b must be empty (since C_b is for black columns, which can't intersect with R_w).

4. R_b x C_w: empty, similarly.

5. R_e x C_e: empty.

Wait, but actually, R_e is the set of rows not in R_w or R_b, and C_e is the set of columns not in C_w or C_b.

So, the entire grid is covered by:

- R_w x C_w: white.

- R_b x C_b: black.

- The rest: empty.

But also, R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint.

Therefore, the problem reduces to choosing subsets R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b such that:

- R_w ∩ R_b = ∅

- C_w ∩ C_b = ∅

- The white region is R_w x C_w.

- The black region is R_b x C_b.

- The rest are empty.

Additionally, the placement must be maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, for every empty cell (i,j), if you try to place a white chip there, it would require that row i is white and column j is white, but since the cell is empty, either row i is not white or column j is not white. Similarly for black.

Wait, but since the placement is maximal, every empty cell must be such that either its row is not white or its column is not white, and similarly for black. So, in other words, for every empty cell (i,j), if row i is white, then column j must be empty, and if column j is white, then row i must be empty. Similarly for black.

But given our earlier structure, where R_w x C_w is white, R_b x C_b is black, and the rest are empty, this condition is automatically satisfied. Because if a cell is empty, it's either because its row is not in R_w or R_b, or its column is not in C_w or C_b.

Wait, but actually, no. Because if a cell is","[5, '5']",902,"[902, '902']",False
