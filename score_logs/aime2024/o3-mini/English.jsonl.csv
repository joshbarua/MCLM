We begin by placing the given rectangles in the coordinate plane. Choose the convenient coordinates

  A = (0,16), B = (107,16), C = (107,0), D = (0,0).

Since D, E, C, F are collinear and DC lies along the x–axis, we let the points on the x–axis be
  D = (0,0), E = (a,0), C = (107,0), F = (a+184,0)
(the length EF is 184, so F has x–coordinate a+184). Also, FG = 17 means the rectangle EFGH has vertical side 17, so taking the vertices in order we set
  E = (a,0), F = (a+184,0), G = (a+184,17), H = (a,17).

The problem tells us that A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. We already know
  A = (0,16) and D = (0,0).

A general circle can be written in the form
  x² + y² + Lx + My + N = 0.
Since D = (0,0) lies on the circle, plugging in gives N = 0. Next, plugging in A = (0,16) yields
  0² + 16² + L·0 + M·16 = 0 ⟹ 256 + 16M = 0 ⟹ M = –16.
Thus, the circle’s equation becomes

To explain briefly, a valid path from the lower left to the upper right corner on an 8×8 grid consists of 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), for a total of 16 moves. A change in direction occurs whenever the move type switches from R to U or U to R. Exactly 4 changes means that the path is divided into 5 segments, each consisting entirely of moves in the same direction.

There are two cases for the pattern of segments:
1. The path begins with R, giving the pattern R–U–R–U–R. Here, there are 3 R-segments summing to 8 (each at least 1) and 2 U-segments summing to 8 (each at least 1). The number of solutions for the R-parts is C(8 – 1, 3 – 1) = C(7, 2) = 21, and for the U-parts is C(8 – 1, 2 – 1) = C(7, 1) = 7. Multiplying gives 21 × 7 = 147 paths in this case.
2. Alternatively, the path can begin with U, yielding the pattern U–R–U–R–U. Now, there are 3 U-segments and 2 R-segments subject to the same constraints, giving 21 × 7 = 147 paths for this case.

Adding the two cases together, the total number of such paths is 147 + 147 = 294.","[294, '294']",294,"[294, '294']",True

To explain briefly:

We wish to evaluate

  P = ∏ₖ₌₀¹² (2 – 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ).

Notice that
  2 – 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ = ω²ᵏ – 2ωᵏ + 2,
so if we define f(x) = x² – 2x + 2, then
  P = ∏ₖ₌₀¹² f(ωᵏ).

Since ω is a 13th root of unity, the numbers ωᵏ (for k = 0, 1, …, 12) are the 13th roots of unity. One can express
  f(x) = (x – (1–i))(x – (1+i)).
Thus,
  ∏ₖ₌₀¹² (ωᵏ – (1–i)) = (1–i)¹³ – 1       [since ∏ₖ₌₀¹² (x – ωᵏ) = x¹³–1 for any x]
and similarly,
  ∏ₖ₌₀¹² (ωᵏ – (1+i)) = (1+i)¹³ – 1.

A sign change appears when rearranging the factors, but these cancel out in the overall product. Thus,
  P = [(1–i)¹³ – 1] · [(1+i)¹³ – 1].

Now using polar form:
  1 + i = √2 · exp(iπ/4) and 1 – i = √2 · exp(–iπ/4),
we compute:
  (1+i)¹³ = (√2)¹³ exp(i13π/4) = 2^(13/2) exp[i(π/4+3π)]
         = –2^(13/2) exp(iπ/4)
         = –2^(6.5)(1+i)/√2 = –64(1+i),
and similarly,
  (1–i)¹³ = –64(1–i).

Therefore,
  (1+i)¹³ – 1 = –64(1+i) – 1 = –65 – 64i,
  (1–i)¹³ – 1 = –64(1–i) – 1 = –65 + 64i.

Multiplying these two, we get:
  (–65 + 64i)(–65 – 64i) = (65)² – (64)²(i²) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Thus, P = 8321, and dividing by 1000 yields a remainder of 321.

Hence, the final answer is \boxed{321}.","[321, '321']",321,"[321, '321']",True
