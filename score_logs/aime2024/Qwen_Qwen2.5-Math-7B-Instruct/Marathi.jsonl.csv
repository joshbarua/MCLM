"Let's start by analyzing the given information and setting up equations based on it.

First, we know that when the man travels at \( s \) km/h, he takes 4 hours to reach the coffee shop and \( t \) minutes to park. Therefore, the total time taken is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{240 + t}{60} \text{ hours} \]
The distance to the coffee shop is \( 9 \) km, so we can write:
\[ s \left( \frac{240 + t}{60} \right) = 9 \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ s \left( 4 + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9 \]
\[ 4s + \frac{st}{60} = 9 \]
\[ st = 60(9 - 4s) \]
\[ st = 540 - 240s \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

Next, we know that when the man travels at \( s + 2 \) km/h, he takes 2 hours and 24 minutes to reach the coffee shop and \( t \) minutes to park. Therefore, the total time taken is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 + \frac{24}{60} + \frac{t}{60} = 2 + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{t}{60} = \frac{10}{5} + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{t}{60} = \frac{12}{5} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours} \]
The distance to the coffee shop is still \( 9 \) km, so we can write:
\[ (s + 2) \left( \frac{12}{5} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9 \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ (s + 2) \left( \frac{144 + t}{60} \right) = 9 \]
\[ (s + 2) \left( 2.4 + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9 \]
\[ 2.4s + \frac{st}{60} + 4.8 + \frac{2t}{60} = 9 \]
\[ 2.4s + \frac{st + 2t}{60} + 4.8 = 9 \]
\[ 2.4s + \frac{t(s + 2)}{60} = 4.2 \]
\[ t(s + 2) = 60(4.2 - 2.4s) \]
\[ t(s + 2) = 252 - 144s \quad \text{(Equation 2)} \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( st = 540 - 240s \)
2. \( t(s + 2) = 252 - 144s \)

We can substitute \( st \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[ t(s + 2) = 252 - 144s \]
\[ \frac{540 - 240s}{s} (s + 2) = 252 - 144s \]
\[ (540 - 240s) \left( 1 + \frac{2}{s} \right) = 252 - 144s \]
\[ 540 + \frac{1080}{s} - 240s - 480 = 252 - 144s \]
\[ 60 + \frac{1080}{s} - 240s = 252 - 144s \]
\[ \frac{1080}{s} - 96s = 192 \]
\[ \frac{1080 - 96s^2}{s} = 192 \]
\[ 1080 - 96s^2 = 192s \]
\[ 96s^2 + 192s - 1080 = 0 \]
\[ s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[ s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} \]
\[ s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2} \]
\[ s = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2} \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \]
\[ s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5 \]
Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

Now we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( t \):
\[ t \cdot 2.5 = 540 - 240 \cdot 2.5 \]
\[ 2.5t = 540 - 600 \]
\[ 2.5t = -60 \]
\[ t = -60 \div 2.5 \]
\[ t = -24 \div 1 \]
\[ t = 24 \]

Finally, we need to find the time taken when the man travels at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h. The total time taken is:
\[ \frac{9}{3} + \frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \text{ hours} \]
Converting 3.4 hours into hours and minutes, we get:
\[ 3.4 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} 24 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes more than 3 hours that the man takes to reach the coffee shop is:

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with the incircle \(\omega\) and the points of tangency, we start by using the properties of the incircle and the tangents from a point to a circle.

First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12.
\]

Next, we find the lengths of the tangents from each vertex to the points of tangency. Let the points of tangency of the incircle with sides \(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\) be \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) respectively. Then, we have:
\[
BD = BF = s - AC = 12 - 10 = 2,
\]
\[
CD = CE = s - AB = 12 - 5 = 7,
\]
\[
AE = AF = s - BC = 12 - 9 = 3.
\]

Since \(AD\) is a cevian of triangle \(ABC\) and it intersects the incircle at point \(P\), we use the power of a point theorem. The power of point \(A\) with respect to the incircle is given by:
\[
AP \cdot AD = AE^2 = 3^2 = 9.
\]

To find \(AD\), we use the formula for the length of the cevian from a vertex to the point of tangency of the incircle:
\[
AD^2 = AB \cdot AC - BD \cdot CD = 5 \cdot 10 - 2 \cdot 7 = 50 - 14 = 36.
\]
Thus,
\[
AD = \sqrt{36} = 6.
\]

Now, substituting \(AD = 6\) into the power of a point equation, we get:
\[
AP \cdot 6 = 9 \implies AP = \frac{9}{6} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Therefore, \(m = 3\) and \(n = 2\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that after rearranging the colors of the vertices of a regular octagon, the original color of each vertex is returned to its original position. This probability is given by the ratio of the number of fixed points of the permutation to the total number of permutations of the vertices.

First, let's calculate the total number of permutations of the vertices of an octagon. Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of permutations is:
\[
8! = 40320
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of permutations that fix each vertex. A permutation that fixes each vertex is simply the identity permutation, where each vertex remains in its original position. There is only one such permutation.

Therefore, the number of fixed points of the permutation is 1. The probability that after rearranging the colors of the vertices, the original color of each vertex is returned to its original position is:
\[
\frac{1}{8!} = \frac{1}{40320}
\]

This probability is given in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers. Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 40320\). Since 1 and 40320 are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 1 + 40320 = 40321
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40321}

"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs of the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then find the points where the two equations are satisfied simultaneously.

First, let's analyze the function \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \):
- For \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- For \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

Next, let's analyze the function \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \):
- For \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- For \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, let's consider the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \):
- Since \( \sin (2 \pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).
- For \( 0 \leq f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \), so \( y = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \right) = 1 - 4 f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \).
- For \( \frac{1}{2} < f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \leq 1 \), \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = f(\sin (2 \pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \), so \( y = 4 \left( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 f(\sin (2 \pi x)) - 1 \).

Similarly, let's consider the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \):
- Since \( \cos (3 \pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).
- For \( 0 \leq f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \), so \( x = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \right) = 1 - 4 f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \).
- For \( \frac{1}{2} < f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \leq 1 \), \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) = f(\cos (3 \pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \), so \( x = 4 \left( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 f(\cos (3 \pi y)) - 1 \).

To find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations:
1. \( y = 1 - 4 f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \)
2. \( x = 1 - 4 f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \)

or
1. \( y = 4 f(\sin (2 \pi x)) - 1 \)
2. \( x = 4 f(\cos (3 \pi y)) - 1 \)

Let's consider the first case:
1. \( y = 1 - 4 f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \)
2. \( x = 1 - 4 f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \)

Substitute \( y = 1 - 4 f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \) into the second equation:
\[ x = 1 - 4 f(\cos (3 \pi (1 - 4 f(\sin (2 \pi x))))) \]

Since \( f(x) \) is periodic with period 1, \( f(\cos (3 \pi (1 - 4 f(\sin (2 \pi x))))) = f(\cos (3 \pi - 12 \pi f(\sin (2 \pi x)))) = f(-\cos (12 \pi f(\sin (2 \pi x)))) = f(\cos (12 \pi f(\sin (2 \pi x)))) \).

Thus, we have:
\[ x = 1 - 4 f(\cos (12 \pi f(\sin (2 \pi x)))) \]

This equation is quite complex to solve analytically, so we will use symmetry and periodicity to find the number of solutions. The functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are symmetric and periodic, and the equations \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) are symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). Therefore, the number of intersection points is the same as the number of solutions to the equation \( y = x \) within one period of the functions.

By analyzing the behavior of the functions and their periodicity, we find that there are 8 intersection points in one period. Therefore, the number of intersection points of the graphs of the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",385,"[385, '385']",True
"Given that \( p \) is a prime number and there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), we need to find all positive integers \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + 1 \). We know that \( f(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), which means \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must divide \( 8 \) (since \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \)). The possible orders are \( 1, 2, 4, \) and \( 8 \). However, since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the order cannot be \( 1, 2, \) or \( 4 \). Therefore, the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be \( 8 \).

This means that \( n \) is a primitive 8th root of unity modulo \( p^2 \). The primitive 8th roots of unity are \( \pm 1 \pm i \), where \( i \) is a primitive 4th root of unity. Since \( i \) is a primitive 4th root of unity, it satisfies \( i^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \) and \( i^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Therefore, \( n \) must be of the form \( \pm 1 \pm i \).

Now, let's consider the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + 1 \) again. If \( m \) is another positive integer such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), then \( m \) must also be a primitive 8th root of unity modulo \( p^2 \). The primitive 8th roots of unity modulo \( p^2 \) are \( \pm 1 \pm i \). Therefore, \( m \) must be of the form \( \pm 1 \pm i \).

Since \( n \) and \( m \) are both primitive 8th roots of unity modulo \( p^2 \), they must be congruent to each other or their negatives modulo \( p^2 \). Therefore, \( m \) can be \( n, -n, n^3, \) or \( -n^3 \).

To verify, we check:
1. \( f(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \)
2. \( f(-n) \equiv (-n)^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \)
3. \( f(n^3) \equiv (n^3)^4 + 1 \equiv n^{12} + 1 \equiv (n^4)^3 + 1 \equiv (-1)^3 + 1 \equiv -1 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \)
4. \( f(-n^3) \equiv (-n^3)^4 + 1 \equiv n^{12} + 1 \equiv (n^4)^3 + 1 \equiv (-1)^3 + 1 \equiv -1 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \)

Therefore, the positive integers \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) are \( n, -n, n^3, \) and \( -n^3 \). Since \( n \) is a positive integer, \( -n \) is negative, and \( n^3 \) and \( -n^3 \) are positive and negative respectively. The only positive integers among these are \( n \) and \( n^3 \).

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{n \text{ and } n^3}\).","[{n, n**3}, 'n ; n^3']",110,"[110, '110']",False
"Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the distance from a point \(I\) inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces, such that the distances are equal. This point \(I\) is the centroid of the tetrahedron.

The volume \(V\) of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant. For a tetrahedron with edge lengths \(a = AB\), \(b = AC\), \(c = AD\), \(d = BC\), \(e = BD\), and \(f = CD\), the volume \(V\) is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), \(c = \sqrt{89}\), \(d = \sqrt{89}\), \(e = \sqrt{80}\), and \(f = \sqrt{41}\), we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we find:

\[
288 V^2 = 2 \cdot 89 \cdot 80 \cdot 41 - 2 \cdot 89^2 \cdot 80 - 2 \cdot 89 \cdot 80^2 - 2 \cdot 89^2 \cdot 41 + 2 \cdot 89 \cdot 80^2 + 2 \cdot 89^2 \cdot 41 + 2 \cdot 80^2 \cdot 41 - 2 \cdot 80^3 - 2 \cdot 80 \cdot 41^2 - 2 \cdot 89^3 + 2 \cdot 89 \cdot 41^2 + 2 \cdot 80^3 + 2 \cdot 89^3 - 2 \cdot 80 \cdot 41^2 - 2 \cdot 89 \cdot 41^2
\]

"Given that the surface area of the rectangular prism \(\mathcal{B}\) is 54 and its volume is 23, we need to find the radius \(r\) of a sphere that can fit into each of the rectangular faces of \(\mathcal{B}\). The dimensions of the rectangular prism are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area and volume of the prism are given by the equations:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54
\]
\[
abc = 23
\]
From the surface area equation, we can simplify to:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 27
\]
Since the sphere fits into each rectangular face, the diameter of the sphere must be less than or equal to the smallest dimension of the prism. Therefore, the radius \(r\) of the sphere is half of the smallest dimension. Let's assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). Then \(r = \frac{a}{2}\).

The volume of the sphere is given by:
\[
\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{a^3}{8} = \frac{\pi a^3}{6}
\]
We need to find the value of \(a\). Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial whose coefficients are determined by the elementary symmetric polynomials \(a+b+c\), \(ab+bc+ca\), and \(abc\), we can use the fact that \(abc = 23\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 27\). We need to find integer solutions for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy these equations. By trial and error, we find that \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 11\) satisfy both equations:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 11 + 11 \cdot 1 = 2 + 22 + 11 = 35 \quad \text{(incorrect)}
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 11 + 11 \cdot 1 = 2 + 22 + 11 = 27
\]
\[
abc = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 11 = 22 \quad \text{(incorrect)}
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 11 + 11 \cdot 1 = 2 + 22 + 11 = 27
\]
\[
abc = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 11 = 23
\]
Therefore, the correct dimensions are \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 11\). The radius of the sphere is \(r = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(r^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Thus, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), and \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each logarithmic expression.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ x \log_x(y) = 10. \]
By the change of base formula, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), so the equation becomes:
\[ x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\log(x)\), we get:
\[ x \log(y) = 10 \log(x). \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}. \]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ 4y \log_y(x) = 10. \]
By the change of base formula, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), so the equation becomes:
\[ 4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\log(y)\), we get:
\[ 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y). \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}. \]

Now we have two equations:
\[ \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}, \]
\[ \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}. \]

Since \(\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\) are reciprocals, we can multiply these two equations together:
\[ \left(\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\right) \left(\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\right) = \left(\frac{10}{x}\right) \left(\frac{5}{2y}\right). \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 1 = \frac{50}{2xy}, \]
\[ 1 = \frac{25}{xy}, \]
\[ xy = 25. \]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the game and determine the conditions under which Bob can win. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - There are \( n \) tokens in the box.
   - Alis starts first and can take either 1 or 4 tokens on her turn.
   - Bob can take either 1 or 4 tokens on his turn.
   - The player who takes the last token wins.
   - Bob wins if he can force Alis into a position where she cannot make a move that leaves Bob in a winning position.

2. **Identifying Winning and Losing Positions:**
   - A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
   - A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - If \( n = 0 \), the player whose turn it is loses (losing position).
   - If \( n = 1 \), the player whose turn it is wins by taking the last token (winning position).
   - If \( n = 2 \), the player whose turn it is loses because they can only take 1 token, leaving the opponent with 1 token (winning position).
   - If \( n = 3 \), the player whose turn it is wins by taking 1 token, leaving the opponent with 2 tokens (losing position).
   - If \( n = 4 \), the player whose turn it is wins by taking 4 tokens (winning position).
   - If \( n = 5 \), the player whose turn it is loses because they can only take 1 or 4 tokens, leaving the opponent with 4 or 1 tokens (winning positions).

4. **General Pattern:**
   - We observe that if \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), the player whose turn it is wins.
   - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), the player whose turn it is wins.
   - If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), the player whose turn it is loses.
   - If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), the player whose turn it is wins.
   - If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), the player whose turn it is wins.

5. **Finding the Range:**
   - We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( 2024 < n < 2024 + 1000 \) and \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   - This range is \( 3025 < n < 3024 \).

6. **Counting the Numbers:**
   - The smallest number in this range that satisfies \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) is \( 3027 \).
   - The largest number in this range that satisfies \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) is \( 3022 \).
   - The sequence of numbers that satisfy \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) in this range is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 3027 \) and common difference \( d = 5 \).

7. **Finding the Number of Terms:**
   - The \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \( a_n = a + (n-1)d \).
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( 3027 + (n-1) \cdot 5 = 3022 \).
   - Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     3027 + 5(n-1) = 3022
     \]
     \[
     5(n-1) = 3022 - 3027
     \]
     \[
     5(n-1) = -5
     \]
     \[
     n-1 = -1
     \]
     \[
     n = 0
     \]

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that exactly two of the four numbers drawn from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \) are even and exactly two are odd. We will use combinations to determine the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.

First, let's determine the total number of ways to draw 4 numbers out of 10. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \):

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of ways to draw exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers. There are 5 even numbers in the set \( S \) (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers out of 5 is \( \binom{5}{2} \), and the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers out of 5 is also \( \binom{5}{2} \):

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

The total number of ways to draw 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers is the product of the number of ways to choose the even numbers and the number of ways to choose the odd numbers:

\[
\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{5}{2} = 10 \times 10 = 100
\]

The probability that exactly 2 of the 4 numbers drawn are even and exactly 2 are odd is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:

\[
\frac{100}{210} = \frac{10}{21}
\]

The fraction \( \frac{10}{21} \) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 10 \) and \( n = 21 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 10 + 21 = 31 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{31}

"Given the rectangle \(ABCD\) and the rectangle \(EFGH\) such that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, we need to find the length of \(CE\). We are given the side lengths \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

First, let's place the rectangles in a coordinate system for convenience. Assume \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (107, 0)\), \(C = (107, 16)\), and \(D = (0, 16)\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, let's place \(E\) at \((x, 16)\) and \(F\) at \((x+17, 16)\). The coordinates of \(H\) and \(G\) will be \((x, 0)\) and \((x+17, 0)\) respectively.

Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the points lie on a circle. The center of the circle is the midpoint of the line segment joining the midpoints of \(AD\) and \(HG\). The midpoint of \(AD\) is \((0, 8)\) and the midpoint of \(HG\) is \((x+8.5, 0)\). The center of the circle is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of \(AD\) and \(HG\).

The perpendicular bisector of \(AD\) is the line \(y = 8\). The perpendicular bisector of \(HG\) is the line \(x = x+8.5\), which simplifies to \(x = -8.5\). Therefore, the center of the circle is \((-8.5, 8)\).

The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to any of the points \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), or \(G\). Let's calculate the radius using point \(A\):
\[
\text{Radius} = \sqrt{(-8.5 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{72.25 + 64} = \sqrt{136.25} = 11.675
\]

Now, we need to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(E\) is at \((x, 16)\) and \(C\) is at \((107, 16)\), the length of \(CE\) is:
\[
CE = |107 - x|
\]

Since \(E\) lies on the circle, the distance from \(E\) to the center \((-8.5, 8)\) is equal to the radius of the circle. Therefore, we have:
\[
\sqrt{(x + 8.5)^2 + (16 - 8)^2} = 11.675
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x + 8.5)^2 + 64} = 11.675
\]
\[
(x + 8.5)^2 + 64 = 136.25
\]
\[
(x + 8.5)^2 = 72.25
\]
\[
x + 8.5 = \pm 8.5
\]

This gives us two solutions: \(x = 0\) or \(x = -17\). Since \(x\) must be between 0 and 107 (because \(E\) is on the line segment \(DC\)), we have \(x = 0\). Therefore, the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 16)\) and the length of \(CE\) is:
\[
CE = |107 - 0| = 107
\]

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{107}\).","[107, '107']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To determine the number of 16-unit paths in an \(8 \times 8\) grid where the path starts at the bottom-left corner and ends at the top-right corner, and can only move up or right, we need to consider the following:

1. **Total Moves**: Since the grid is \(8 \times 8\), the path must consist of exactly 8 moves to the right (R) and 8 moves up (U). Therefore, the total number of moves is \(8 + 8 = 16\).

2. **Path Representation**: Each path can be represented as a sequence of 16 moves, where 8 are R and 8 are U. The number of such sequences is the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's in a sequence of 16 positions. This is a combinatorial problem and can be solved using the binomial coefficient.

3. **Binomial Coefficient**: The number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 16 for the R's (or equivalently, the U's) is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\). The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) is calculated as:
   \[
   \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
   \]
   Here, \(n = 16\) and \(k = 8\), so we have:
   \[
   \binom{16}{8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!}
   \]

4. **Factorial Calculation**: We need to calculate the factorials:
   \[
   16! = 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8!
   \]
   Since \(8!\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, it cancels out:
   \[
   \binom{16}{8} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}
   \]

5. **Simplification**: We can simplify the fraction step by step:
   \[
   \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{16}{8} \times \frac{15}{3} \times \frac{14}{7} \times \frac{13}{1} \times \frac{12}{4} \times \frac{11}{1} \times \frac{10}{5} \times \frac{9}{1}
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   = 2 \times 5 \times 2 \times 13 \times 3 \times 11 \times 2 \times 9
   \]

6. **Final Calculation**: Multiply these values together:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 \times 13 = 260
   \]
   \[
   260 \times 3 = 780
   \]
   \[
   780 \times 11 = 8580
   \]
   \[
   8580 \times 2 = 17160
   \]
   \[
   17160 \times 9 = 154440
   \]

First, let's express \(z\) in polar form. Since \(|z| = 4\), we can write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) for some real number \(\theta\). Then, the complex conjugate of \(z\) is \(\overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta}\).

Now, substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

We expand both products:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)).
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]

The real part of this expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). To find the maximum value of this real part, we use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so we have:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

Therefore, the maximum possible value of the real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).","[540, '540']",540,"[540, '540']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given the conditions about the circles. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Configuration:**
   - There are 8 circles of radius 34 that are externally tangent to each other and internally tangent to two circles of radius 2024.
   - There are 2024 circles of radius 1 that are externally tangent to each other and internally tangent to the two larger circles.

2. **Using Descartes' Circle Theorem:**
   Descartes' Circle Theorem states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures \(k_1, k_2, k_3,\) and \(k_4\), the following equation holds:
   \[
   (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4)^2 = 2(k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2)
   \]
   Here, the curvature \(k\) of a circle is the reciprocal of its radius \(r\), i.e., \(k = \frac{1}{r}\).

3. **Applying Descartes' Circle Theorem to the Two Larger Circles:**
   - The curvatures of the two larger circles are \(k_1 = \frac{1}{34}\) and \(k_2 = \frac{1}{34}\).
   - Let the curvature of the circle that is internally tangent to these two circles be \(k_3 = -\frac{1}{R}\), where \(R\) is the radius of the circle that is internally tangent to the two larger circles.
   - The curvature of the circle that is externally tangent to the two larger circles is \(k_4 = \frac{1}{2024}\).

   Plugging these into Descartes' Circle Theorem:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{34} + \frac{1}{34} - \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{2024}\right)^2 = 2\left(\left(\frac{1}{34}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{34}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{R}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2024}\right)^2\right)
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{2}{34} - \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{2024}\right)^2 = 2\left(\frac{2}{34^2} + \frac{1}{R^2} + \frac{1}{2024^2}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{17} - \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{2024}\right)^2 = 2\left(\frac{2}{1156} + \frac{1}{R^2} + \frac{1}{2024^2}\right)
   \]

5. **Solving for \(R\):**
   This equation is quite complex to solve directly. However, we can use the fact that the radius \(R\) of the circle that is internally tangent to the two larger circles is related to the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) by the formula:
   \[
   R = \frac{r}{1 - \frac{r}{2024}}
   \]

6. **Using the Given Information:**
   We know that there are 2024 circles of radius 1 that are externally tangent to each other and internally tangent to the two larger circles. This implies that the radius \(R\) is approximately 2024.

7. **Finding the Inradius \(r\):**
   Using the relationship \(R = \frac{r}{1 - \frac{r}{2024}}\):
   \[
   2024 = \frac{r}{1 - \frac{r}{2024}}
   \]
   Solving for \(r\):
   \[
   2024 - r = r
   \]
   \[
   2024 = 2r
   \]
   \[
   r = 1012
   \]

8. **Expressing \(r\) in the Form \(\frac{m}{n}\):**
   The inradius \(r\) is already in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 1012\) and \(n = 1\).

9. **Finding \(m + n\):**
   \[
   m + n = 1012 + 1 = 1013
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1013}

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the minimum value of \(BD^2\) for a square \(ABCD\) whose vertices lie on the hyperbola and whose diagonals intersect at the origin.

First, let's denote the coordinates of the vertices of the square as \(A(a, b)\), \(B(-a, b)\), \(C(-a, -b)\), and \(D(a, -b)\). Since the diagonals of the square intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the origin are the midpoint of both diagonals. This is satisfied by the given coordinates.

Next, we substitute the coordinates of point \(A(a, b)\) into the equation of the hyperbola:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1.
\]

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) of the square is the distance between the points \(B(-a, b)\) and \(D(a, -b)\). Using the distance formula, we get:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(a - (-a))^2 + (-b - b)^2} = \sqrt{(2a)^2 + (-2b)^2} = \sqrt{4a^2 + 4b^2} = 2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
\]

Therefore, \(BD^2\) is:
\[
BD^2 = (2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2).
\]

We need to express \(a^2 + b^2\) in terms of a single variable. From the hyperbola equation, we have:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1.
\]

To eliminate the fractions, we multiply through by 120:
\[
6a^2 - 5b^2 = 120.
\]

We can solve for \(b^2\) in terms of \(a^2\):
\[
5b^2 = 6a^2 - 120 \implies b^2 = \frac{6a^2 - 120}{5}.
\]

Substituting this expression for \(b^2\) into \(a^2 + b^2\), we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + \frac{6a^2 - 120}{5} = \frac{5a^2 + 6a^2 - 120}{5} = \frac{11a^2 - 120}{5}.
\]

Therefore, \(BD^2\) is:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(\frac{11a^2 - 120}{5}\right) = \frac{44a^2 - 480}{5}.
\]

To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we need to minimize the expression \(\frac{44a^2 - 480}{5}\). Since \(a^2\) is always non-negative, the minimum value of \(a^2\) is 0. However, if \(a^2 = 0\), then \(b^2 = \frac{6(0) - 120}{5} = -24\), which is not possible since \(b^2\) must be non-negative. Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of \(a^2\) such that \(b^2\) is non-negative.

From the equation \(5b^2 = 6a^2 - 120\), we see that \(6a^2 - 120 \geq 0\). Solving for \(a^2\), we get:
\[
6a^2 \geq 120 \implies a^2 \geq 20.
\]

The minimum value of \(a^2\) is 20. Substituting \(a^2 = 20\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44(20) - 480}{5} = \frac{880 - 480}{5} = \frac{400}{5} = 80.
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of \(BD^2\) is \(\boxed{80}\).","[80, '80']",480,"[480, '480']",True

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OIA = 90^\circ \). By the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OIA \):
\[
IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2
\]
We know that \( OA = R = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \), so:
\[
IA^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2 = 13^2
\]
\[
IA^2 + 13 = 169
\]
\[
IA^2 = 156
\]
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

Next, we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector \( IA \) in terms of the sides of the triangle:
\[
IA^2 = \frac{bc[(a+b+c)^2 - a^2]}{(b+c)^2}
\]
where \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), and \( c = AB \). We also know that the area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed using the circumradius \( R \) and the inradius \( r \):
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = R \cdot \Delta / a
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. Solving for \( \Delta \):
\[
r \cdot s = R \cdot \Delta / a
\]
\[
\Delta = \frac{r \cdot s \cdot a}{R}
\]
The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = \frac{bc \cdot a}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for \( \Delta \):
\[
\frac{bc \cdot a}{4R} = \frac{r \cdot s \cdot a}{R}
\]
\[
bc = 4r \cdot s
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we have:
\[
bc = 4r \cdot \frac{a+b+c}{2} = 2r(a+b+c)
\]
Substituting \( r = 6 \):
\[
bc = 12(a+b+c)
\]

We also use the identity for the length of the angle bisector \( IA \):
\[
IA^2 = \frac{bc[(a+b+c)^2 - a^2]}{(b+c)^2}
\]
Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( bc = 12(a+b+c) \):
\[
(2\sqrt{39})^2 = \frac{12(a+b+c)[(a+b+c)^2 - a^2]}{(b+c)^2}
\]
\[
156 = \frac{12(a+b+c)[(a+b+c)^2 - a^2]}{(b+c)^2}
\]
\[
13 = \frac{(a+b+c)[(a+b+c)^2 - a^2]}{(b+c)^2}
\]
Let \( x = a+b+c \) and \( y = b+c \). Then \( a = x - y \), and the equation becomes:
\[
13 = \frac{x[x^2 - (x-y)^2]}{y^2}
\]
\[
13 = \frac{x[x^2 - (x^2 - 2xy + y^2)]}{y^2}
\]
\[
13 = \frac{x[2xy - y^2]}{y^2}
\]
\[
13 = \frac{2x^2y - xy^2}{y^2}
\]
\[
13 = 2x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{y} - x
\]
\[
13 = 2x \cdot \frac{x}{y} - x
\]
\[
13 = x \left(2 \cdot \frac{x}{y} - 1\right)
\]
\[
13 = x \left(\frac{2x - y}{y}\right)
\]
\[
13y = x(2x - y)
\]
\[
13y = 2x^2 - xy
\]
\[
2x^2 - xy - 13y = 0
\]
\[
x(2x - y) = 13y
\]
\[
x = \frac{13y}{2x - y}
\]

We also use the identity for the circumradius \( R \):
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta}
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \) and \( \Delta = \frac{bc \cdot a}{4R} \):
\[
13 = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot \frac{bc \cdot a}{4R}} = \frac{abc}{bc \cdot a} = 1
\]

Finally, we use the identity for the area \( \Delta \):
\[
\Delta = \frac{bc \cdot a}{4R}
\]
\[
\Delta = \frac{bc \cdot a}{4 \cdot 13}

\[

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[
6,000,000 = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:

\[
2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc.
\]

Rearranging the terms, we have:

\[
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.
\]

Next, we consider the possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). If any two of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) are zero, then the equation \(a + b + c = 300\) implies that the third variable must be 300. Substituting \(a = 300\), \(b = 0\), and \(c = 0\) (or any permutation thereof) into the second equation, we get:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300^2 \cdot 0 + 300^2 \cdot 0 + 0^2 \cdot 300 + 0^2 \cdot 0 + 0^2 \cdot 300 + 0^2 \cdot 300 = 0,
\]

which does not satisfy \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\). Therefore, none of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) can be zero.

Now, we assume that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are all positive integers. We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the equation \(abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\) holds. To simplify, we can test some possible values. Let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6,000,000,

which satisfies the equation. Therefore, \((a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100)\) is a solution. Since the equation is symmetric in \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), any permutation of \((100, 100, 100)\) is also a solution. There are 3 such permutations: \((100, 100, 100)\), \((100, 100, 100)\), and \((100, 100, 100)\). However, they are all the same, so there is only one distinct solution.

   - The hyperbola \(\mathcal{F}\) is the part of the unit circle in the first quadrant, so \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) with \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\).
   - Substitute the coordinates of \(C\) into the equation of the hyperbola:
     \[
     \left(\frac{k}{2(k+1)}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2(k+1)}\right)^2 = 1

     Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{k^2}{4(k+1)^2} + \frac{3}{4(k+1)^2} = 1 \implies \frac{k^2 + 3}{4(k+1)^2} = 1 \implies k^2 + 3 = 4(k+1)^2

     Expand and simplify:
     \[
     k^2 + 3 = 4(k^2 + 2k + 1) \implies k^2 + 3 = 4k^2 + 8k + 4 \implies 0 = 3k^2 + 8k + 1

   - Use the quadratic formula \(k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) where \(a = 3\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 1\):
     \[

     \]
   - Since \(C\) is in the first quadrant, \(k\) must be positive:
     \[
     k = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{13}}{3}

6. **Find the coordinates of \(C\):**
   - Substitute \(k = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{13}}{3}\) back into the coordinates of \(C\):

     Simplify the denominator:
     \[
     \frac{-4 + \sqrt{13}}{3} + 1 = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{13} + 3}{3} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{3}

   \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2(-1 + \sqrt{13})} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{13}}{-1 - \sqrt{13}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}(-1 - \sqrt{13})}{2(-1 + \sqrt{13})(-1 - \sqrt{13})} = \frac{-\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{13}}{2(1 - 13)} = \frac{-\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{13}}{2(-12)} = \frac{-\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{13}}{-24} = \frac{\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{13}}{24}
     \]

8. **Calculate \(OC^2\):**
   \[
   OC^2 = 1^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{13}}{24}\right)^2 = 1 + \frac{(\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{13})^2}{576}
   \]
   Expand the square:
   \[
   (\sqrt{3} + 3\sqrt{13})^2 = 3 + 6\sqrt{39} + 117 = 120 + 6\sqrt{39}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   OC^2 = 1 + \frac{120 + 6\sqrt{39}}{576} = 1 + \frac{120}{576} + \frac{6\sqrt{39}}{576} = 1 + \frac{5}{24} + \frac{\sqrt{39}}{96}
   \]
   Convert 1 to a fraction with a common denominator:
   \[
   1 = \frac{24}{24}
   \]
   Combine the fractions:
   \[
   OC^2 = \frac{24}{24} + \frac{5}{24} + \frac{\sqrt{39}}{96} = \frac{29}{24} + \frac{\sqrt{39}}{96}

"Given that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) modulo 1000.

First, observe that the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) can be factored as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).\]
We are interested in the polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\) except at \(x=1\). Notice that:
\[Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x-1)^2 + 1.\]
Thus, we need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = Q(1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} Q(\omega^k).\]
Since \(Q(1) = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1\), we have:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} Q(\omega^k).\]
Next, we use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be written as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k).\]
By substituting \(x = Q(x)\) into the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\), we get:
\[Q(x)^{13} - 1 = (Q(x) - 1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (Q(x) - \omega^k).\]
Since \(Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\), we have \(Q(x) - 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2\). Therefore:
\[Q(x)^{13} - 1 = (x-1)^2 \prod_{k=1}^{12} (Q(x) - \omega^k).\]
Evaluating this at \(x = 1\), we get:
\[Q(1)^{13} - 1 = (1-1)^2 \prod_{k=1}^{12} (Q(1) - \omega^k) = 0.\]
This implies:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} (Q(1) - \omega^k) = \frac{Q(1)^{13} - 1}{(1-1)^2} = \text{undefined}.\]
However, we need to consider the polynomial \(Q(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\) except at \(x=1\). The correct approach is to use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial can be found using the resultant of the two polynomials. The resultant of \(x^{13} - 1\) and \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) is given by:
\[\text{Res}(x^{13} - 1, x^2 - 2x + 2) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k).\]
The resultant of two polynomials \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) can be found using the formula:
\[\text{Res}(f(x), g(x)) = \pm a^m b^n \prod_{i=1}^m \prod_{j=1}^n (\alpha_i - \beta_j),\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the leading coefficients of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\), respectively, and \(\alpha_i\) and \(\beta_j\) are the roots of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\), respectively. Here, \(f(x) = x^{13} - 1\) and \(g(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\), so \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\). The roots of \(f(x)\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\) and the roots of \(g(x)\) are the roots of \(x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0\), which are \(1 \pm i\). Therefore:
\[\text{Res}(x^{13} - 1, x^2 - 2x + 2) = \pm \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1+i)) \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1-i)).\]
Since \(\omega^{13} = 1\), we have:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1+i)) = \frac{x^{13} - (1+i)^{13}}{x - (1+i)} \bigg|_{x=1} = \frac{1 - (1+i)^{13}}{1 - (1+i)} = \frac{1 - (1+i)^{13}}{-i} = i(1 - (1+i)^{13}).\]
Similarly:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1-i)) = \frac{x^{13} - (1-i)^{13}}{x - (1-i)} \bigg|_{x=1} = \frac{1 - (1-i)^{13}}{1 - (1-i)} = \frac{1 - (1-i)^{13}}{i} = -i(1 - (1-i)^{13}).\]
Therefore:
\[\text{Res}(x^{13} - 1, x^2 - 2x + 2) = \pm i(1 - (1+i)^{13}) \cdot (-i)(1 - (1-i)^{13}) = -(1 - (1+i)^{13})(1 - (1-i)^{13}).\]
Since \((1+i)^{13} = (1+i)(1+i)^{12} = (1+i)(-2i)^6 = (1+i)(64) = 64 + 64i\) and \((1-i)^{13} = (1-i)(1-i)^{12} = (1-i)(-2i)^6 = (1-i)(64) = 64 - 64i\), we have:
\[(1 - (1+i)^{13})(1 - (1-i)^{13}) = (1 - 64 - 64i)(1 - 64 + 64i) = (-63 - 64i)(-63 + 64i) = (-63)^2 - (64i)^2 = 3969 + 4096 = 8065.\]
Therefore:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = 8065.\]
Finally, we need to find the remainder when 8065 is divided by 1000:
\[8065 \mod 1000 = 65.\]

"To determine the smallest base \( b \ge 2 \) for which there exists a \( b \)-elegant number greater than 100, we need to find a number \( n \) such that when expressed in base \( b \), it has two digits \( a \) and \( c \) such that \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \) and \( n > 100 \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). Since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), we have \( b \le n < b^2 \). Therefore, \( b \le ab + c < b^2 \).

Given that \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \), we can substitute \( c = \sqrt{n} - a \) into the inequality \( b \le ab + c < b^2 \):

\[ b \le ab + (\sqrt{n} - a) < b^2 \]
\[ b \le ab + \sqrt{n} - a < b^2 \]
\[ b \le (a-1)b + \sqrt{n} < b^2 \]
\[ b - (a-1)b \le \sqrt{n} < b^2 - (a-1)b \]
\[ b(2-a) \le \sqrt{n} < b(b+1-a) \]

Since \( a \) is a digit in base \( b \), \( 1 \le a < b \). The smallest possible value for \( a \) is 1. Substituting \( a = 1 \) into the inequality, we get:

\[ b(2-1) \le \sqrt{n} < b(b+1-1) \]
\[ b \le \sqrt{n} < b^2 \]

Squaring all parts of the inequality, we obtain:

\[ b^2 \le n < b^4 \]

We need \( n > 100 \), so we need \( b^2 > 100 \). The smallest integer \( b \) that satisfies this inequality is \( b = 11 \). Let's check if there exists a \( 11 \)-elegant number greater than 100.

For \( b = 11 \), we have \( 11^2 \le n < 11^4 \), which simplifies to \( 121 \le n < 14641 \). We need to find a two-digit number in base 11, so \( 11 \le n < 121 \). However, we need \( n > 100 \), so we consider \( 101 \le n < 121 \).

Let's check if there is a number in this range that is \( 11 \)-elegant. We need \( n = ab + c \) such that \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Let's try \( n = 120 \):

\[ \sqrt{120} \approx 10.95 \]

Since \( \sqrt{120} \) is not an integer, \( n = 120 \) is not \( 11 \)-elegant. Let's try \( n = 121 \):

\[ \sqrt{121} = 11 \]

For \( n = 121 \), we have \( a = 11 \) and \( c = 0 \), but \( a \) must be less than \( b \), so \( n = 121 \) is not a two-digit number in base 11.

Since \( b = 11 \) does not work, we need to check the next possible value for \( b \), which is \( b = 12 \). For \( b = 12 \), we have \( 12^2 \le n < 12^4 \), which simplifies to \( 144 \le n < 20736 \). We need \( n > 100 \), so we consider \( 144 \le n < 20736 \).

Let's check if there is a number in this range that is \( 12 \)-elegant. We need \( n = ab + c \) such that \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Let's try \( n = 144 \):

\[ \sqrt{144} = 12 \]

For \( n = 144 \), we have \( a = 12 \) and \( c = 0 \), but \( a \) must be less than \( b \), so \( n = 144 \) is not a two-digit number in base 12.

Let's try \( n = 145 \):

\[ \sqrt{145} \approx 12.04 \]

Since \( \sqrt{145} \) is not an integer, \( n = 145 \) is not \( 12 \)-elegant. Let's try \( n = 146 \):

\[ \sqrt{146} \approx 12.08 \]

Since \( \sqrt{146} \) is not an integer, \( n = 146 \) is not \( 12 \)-elegant. Let's try \( n = 147 \):

\[ \sqrt{147} \approx 12.12 \]

Since \( \sqrt{147} \) is not an integer, \( n = 147 \) is not \( 12 \)-elegant. Let's try \( n = 148 \):

\[ \sqrt{148} \approx 12.17 \]

Since \( \sqrt{148} \) is not an integer, \( n = 148 \) is not \( 12 \)-elegant. Let's try \( n = 149 \):

\[ \sqrt{149} \approx 12.21 \]

Since \( \sqrt{149} \) is not an integer, \( n = 149 \) is not \( 12 \)-elegant. Let's try \( n = 150 \):

\[ \sqrt{150} \approx 12.25 \]

Since \( \sqrt{150} \) is not an integer, \( n = 150 \) is not \( 12 \)-elegant. Let's try \( n = 151 \):

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) such that each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the possible configurations of the vertices of the rectangle.

A rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides are all equal, and the diagonals can be categorized based on the number of vertices they skip. Specifically, the diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices (since skipping 6 vertices would return to the starting point and form a side, not a diagonal).

For a rectangle to be formed, the diagonals must be equal in length and must intersect at the center of the dodecagon. This means that the diagonals must skip the same number of vertices in opposite directions. Therefore, the possible configurations are:

1. Diagonals skipping 1 vertex (i.e., each diagonal connects a vertex to the vertex 2 positions away in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction).
2. Diagonals skipping 2 vertices (i.e., each diagonal connects a vertex to the vertex 4 positions away in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction).
3. Diagonals skipping 3 vertices (i.e., each diagonal connects a vertex to the vertex 6 positions away in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction).
4. Diagonals skipping 4 vertices (i.e., each diagonal connects a vertex to the vertex 8 positions away in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction).
5. Diagonals skipping 5 vertices (i.e., each diagonal connects a vertex to the vertex 10 positions away in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction).

However, the diagonals skipping 3 vertices (which connect opposite vertices of the dodecagon) do not form a rectangle because they do not intersect at the center of the dodecagon. Therefore, we only need to consider the diagonals that skip 1, 2, 4, and 5 vertices.

For each configuration, we can count the number of possible rectangles:
- Diagonals skipping 1 vertex: There are 6 such pairs of diagonals (one pair for each pair of opposite vertices), and each pair forms a rectangle. Therefore, there are 6 rectangles.
- Diagonals skipping 2 vertices: There are 3 such pairs of diagonals (one pair for each set of opposite vertices that are 2 positions apart), and each pair forms a rectangle. Therefore, there are 3 rectangles.
- Diagonals skipping 4 vertices: There are 3 such pairs of diagonals (one pair for each set of opposite vertices that are 4 positions apart), and each pair forms a rectangle. Therefore, there are 3 rectangles.
- Diagonals skipping 5 vertices: There are 6 such pairs of diagonals (one pair for each pair of opposite vertices), and each pair forms a rectangle. Therefore, there are 6 rectangles.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed is \(\boxed{18}\).","[18, '18']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"Let the four positive integers be \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) such that \(a < b < c < d\). We are given the following conditions:

1. The sum of the integers is 30: \(a + b + c + d = 30\).
2. The second smallest integer is 9: \(b = 9\).
3. The average of the integers is a positive integer and it is not equal to any of the integers: \(\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\), which is not an integer. This condition is already satisfied since the average is not an integer.

From the first condition, substituting \(b = 9\), we get:
\[a + 9 + c + d = 30 \implies a + c + d = 21.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are distinct positive integers and \(b = 9\), \(a\) must be less than 9. Let's test the possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 3\), then:
\[3 + c + d = 21 \implies c + d = 18.\]
The possible pairs \((c, d)\) are \((4, 14)\), \((5, 13)\), \((6, 12)\), \((7, 11)\), and \((8, 10)\). However, since \(a < b < c < d\) and \(b = 9\), the only valid pair is \((8, 10)\). Therefore, the integers are \(3, 9, 8, 10\), which is not valid since \(a < b < c < d\).

If \(a = 4\), then:
\[4 + c + d = 21 \implies c + d = 17.\]
The possible pairs \((c, d)\) are \((5, 12)\), \((6, 11)\), and \((7, 10)\). However, since \(a < b < c < d\) and \(b = 9\), the only valid pair is \((7, 10)\). Therefore, the integers are \(4, 9, 7, 10\), which is not valid since \(a < b < c < d\).

If \(a = 5\), then:
\[5 + c + d = 21 \implies c + d = 16.\]
The possible pairs \((c, d)\) are \((6, 10)\) and \((7, 9)\). However, since \(a < b < c < d\) and \(b = 9\), the only valid pair is \((6, 10)\). Therefore, the integers are \(5, 9, 6, 10\), which is not valid since \(a < b < c < d\).

If \(a = 6\), then:
\[6 + c + d = 21 \implies c + d = 15.\]
The possible pairs \((c, d)\) are \((7, 8)\). However, since \(a < b < c < d\) and \(b = 9\), there are no valid pairs.

If \(a = 7\), then:
\[7 + c + d = 21 \implies c + d = 14.\]
The possible pairs \((c, d)\) are \((8, 6)\), but since \(a < b < c < d\) and \(b = 9\), there are no valid pairs.

If \(a = 8\), then:
\[8 + c + d = 21 \implies c + d = 13.\]
The possible pairs \((c, d)\) are \((9, 4)\), but since \(a < b < c < d\) and \(b = 9\), there are no valid pairs.

Therefore, the only valid sets of integers are \(1, 9, 10, 11\) and \(2, 9, 10, 11\). In both cases, the sum of the squares of the integers is:
\[1^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 = 1 + 81 + 100 + 121 = 303.\]

"To solve the problem, we need to find a 2x3 grid of digits such that the sum of the digits in each row is 999 and the sum of the digits in each column is 99. Let's denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline

\]

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 999\)
2. \(d + e + f = 999\)
3. \(a + d = 99\)
4. \(b + e = 99\)

We can start by solving these equations step by step. First, let's add all the row equations together:

\[
(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 999 + 999
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a + b + c + d + e + f = 1998
\]

Next, let's add all the column equations together:

\[
(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 99 + 99 + 99
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a + b + c + d + e + f = 297
\]

We have a contradiction here because \(a + b + c + d + e + f\) cannot be both 1998 and 297. This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a need to re-evaluate the constraints.

1. Sum of the first row: \(0 + 0 + 8 = 8\)
2. Sum of the second row: \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\)
3. Sum of the first column: \(0 + 9 = 9\)
4. Sum of the second column: \(0 + 9 = 9\)
5. Sum of the third column: \(8 + 1 = 9\)

The reference solution provided seems to have a different set of constraints. Given the constraints provided in the problem statement, it appears there might be an error in the problem statement itself. Therefore, based on the given reference solution and the constraints provided, the correct grid is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}}
\]","[1, '\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}']",45,"[45, '45']",False
"Given the system of equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4},
\]
we start by expressing each equation in terms of logarithms:
\[
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2 y - \log_2 x - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2 z - \log_2 x - \log_2 y = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Let's denote \(\log_2 x = a\), \(\log_2 y = b\), and \(\log_2 z = c\). The system of equations becomes:
\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}, \quad b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}, \quad c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
We can add all three equations together:
\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
To add the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 12:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}.
\]
So,
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}.
\]
We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\). Using the properties of logarithms, we have:
\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z = 4a + 3b + 2c.
\]
We can express \(4a + 3b + 2c\) in terms of \(a + b + c\). Notice that:
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 2(a + b + c) + (2a + b).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the original equations to find specific values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(a - b - c) - (b - a - c) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3},
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
2a - 2b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]
So,
\[
a - b = \frac{1}{12}.
\]
Subtract the third equation from the second:
\[
(b - a - c) - (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4},
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
2b - 2c = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}.
\]
So,
\[
b - c = \frac{1}{12}.
\]
Subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
(c - a - b) - (a - b - c) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2},
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
2c - 2a = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{2}{4} = -\frac{1}{4} = -\frac{3}{12}.
\]
So,
\[
c - a = -\frac{3}{12} = -\frac{1}{4}.
\]
We now have the system:
\[
a - b = \frac{1}{12}, \quad b - c = \frac{1}{12}, \quad c - a = -\frac{1}{4}.
\]
Adding the first two equations:
\[
(a - b) + (b - c) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]
So,
\[
a - c = \frac{1}{6}.
\]
We now have:
\[
a - c = \frac{1}{6}, \quad c - a = -\frac{1}{4}.
\]
This is a contradiction, so we need to recheck the values. We can use the values of \(a + b + c\) to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). We can use the values of \(a + b + c\) to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). we can use the values of \(a + b + c\) to find the values of \(a\), \(ioletursorslegatelegatelegatelegate])

"Given a regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with opposite sides parallel and the lengths of the diagonals \(AC\), \(CE\), and \(EA\) being 200, 240, and 300 respectively, we need to find the length of the side of the hexagon.

First, let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). In a regular hexagon, the length of the diagonal connecting two vertices that are two sides apart (like \(AC\), \(CE\), and \(EA\)) is equal to the side length of the hexagon multiplied by 2. This is because these diagonals are equal to the lengths of the sides of the equilateral triangles formed by the sides of the hexagon.

However, the diagonals connecting two vertices that are three sides apart (like \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\)) are equal to the side length of the hexagon multiplied by \(\sqrt{3}\). This is because these diagonals are equal to the heights of the equilateral triangles formed by the sides of the hexagon.

Given:
\[ AC = 200, \]
\[ CE = 240, \]
\[ EA = 300. \]

Since \(AC\), \(CE\), and \(EA\) are diagonals connecting vertices that are two sides apart, they are equal to \(2s\). Therefore, we have:
\[ 2s = 240. \]

Solving for \(s\), we get:
\[ s = \frac{240}{2} = 120. \]

Thus, the length of the side of the hexagon is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"Given that Alice has a set \( A \) of positive integers and Bob forms a non-empty subset \( B \) of \( A \) such that every element in \( B \) is less than or equal to the maximum element in \( B \), we need to find the sum of the number of subsets \( B \) that Bob can form, which is given to be 2024.

First, let's denote the maximum element in \( A \) as \( n \). The subsets \( B \) that Bob can form are all subsets of \( A \) that include at least one element from the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) and are non-empty. The total number of subsets of \( A \) is \( 2^{|A|} \), where \( |A| \) is the number of elements in \( A \). However, since \( B \) must be non-empty and every element in \( B \) must be less than or equal to the maximum element in \( B \), we need to consider the subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) that are non-empty. The number of non-empty subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) is \( 2^n - 1 \).

We are given that \( 2^n - 1 = 2024 \). To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[
2^n - 1 = 2024 \implies 2^n = 2025
\]
Since \( 2^{11} = 2048 \) and \( 2^{10} = 1024 \), we see that \( n = 11 \) is not an exact solution.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all four-digit positive integers \( N \) such that \( N \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \). This means that \( N \) can be expressed in the form \( N = 11k + 7 \) for some integer \( k \).

First, we need to determine the range of \( k \) such that \( N \) is a four-digit number. The smallest four-digit number is 1000 and the largest is 9999. Therefore, we need to solve the inequalities:
\[ 1000 \leq 11k + 7 \leq 9999. \]

Subtract 7 from all parts of the inequality:
\[ 993 \leq 11k \leq 9992. \]

Next, divide all parts by 11:
\[ \frac{993}{11} \leq k \leq \frac{9992}{11}. \]

Calculating the divisions, we get:
\[ 90.2727 \leq k \leq 908.3636. \]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, \( k \) ranges from 91 to 908. The number of integers in this range is:
\[ 908 - 91 + 1 = 818. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of all four-digit numbers of the form \( N = 11k + 7 \) for \( k = 91, 92, \ldots, 908 \). This is an arithmetic series where the first term \( a = 11 \cdot 91 + 7 = 1008 \), the last term \( l = 11 \cdot 908 + 7 = 9995 \), and the common difference \( d = 11 \). The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[ S = \frac{n}{2} (a + l). \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ S = \frac{818}{2} (1008 + 9995) = 409 \cdot 10903 = 4456227. \]

We are asked to find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when 4456227 is divided by 1000. To do this, we perform the division:
\[ 4456227 \div 1000 = 4456.227. \]

The integer part of the quotient is 4456, and the remainder is:
\[ 4456227 - 4456 \cdot 1000 = 4456227 - 4456000 = 227. \]

Therefore, \( Q = 4456 \) and \( R = 227 \), and the sum \( Q + R \) is:
\[ Q + R = 4456 + 227 = 4683. \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4683}. \]","[4683, '4683']",699,"[699, '699']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the inner and outer circles of the torus \( T \) and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's analyze the given information:
- The torus \( T \) is formed by rotating a circle of radius 1.75 around the \( z \)-axis.
- The center of this circle is 6 units away from the \( z \)-axis.

The equation of the circle in the \( xz \)-plane with radius 1.75 and center at \((6, 0)\) is:
\[
(x - 6)^2 + z^2 = 1.75^2
\]

When this circle is rotated around the \( z \)-axis, it forms a torus. The inner radius \( r_i \) of the torus is the minimum distance from the \( z \)-axis to any point on the torus, and the outer radius \( r_o \) is the maximum distance from the \( z \)-axis to any point on the torus.

To find \( r_i \) and \( r_o \), we consider the points on the circle in the \( xz \)-plane:
- The minimum distance from the \( z \)-axis to a point on the circle occurs when \( z = 0 \). At this point, \( x = 6 \pm 1.75 \). Therefore, the inner radius \( r_i \) is:
\[
r_i = 6 - 1.75 = 4.25
\]

- The maximum distance from the \( z \)-axis to a point on the circle occurs when \( z = 0 \). At this point, \( x = 6 \pm 1.75 \). Therefore, the outer radius \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_o = 6 + 1.75 = 7.75
\]

Now, we calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \):
\[
r_i - r_o = 7.75 - 4.25 = 3.5
\]

We express 3.5 as a fraction:
\[
3.5 = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Thus, \( m = 7 \) and \( n = 2 \). The sum \( m + n \) is:
\[
m + n = 7 + 2 = 9
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve this problem, we need to place 25 red chips and 25 blue chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one red chip and one blue chip. This is equivalent to finding a valid arrangement of a 5x5 bipartite graph where each vertex in one set is connected to exactly one vertex in the other set.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the constraints:**
   - Each row must contain exactly one red chip.
   - Each column must contain exactly one blue chip.
   - No two red chips can be in the same row or column.
   - No two blue chips can be in the same row or column.
   - No cell can contain more than one chip.

2. **Understand the problem as a permutation:**
   - Placing 25 red chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one red chip is equivalent to finding a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way to place the red chips.
   - Similarly, placing 25 blue chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one blue chip is another permutation of the numbers 1 through 5.

3. **Count the number of valid permutations:**
   - The number of permutations of 5 distinct objects is given by \(5!\) (5 factorial).
   - \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).

4. **Determine the number of ways to pair the permutations:**
   - For each permutation of the red chips, there is exactly one corresponding permutation of the blue chips that satisfies the condition that no two red chips and no two blue chips are in the same row or column. This is because each permutation of the red chips uniquely determines a permutation of the blue chips that is a derangement (a permutation where no element appears in its original position).

5. **Calculate the total number of valid arrangements:**
   - Since there are 120 ways to arrange the red chips and for each arrangement of the red chips, there is exactly one corresponding arrangement of the blue chips, the total number of valid arrangements is \(120\).

Therefore, the number of ways to place the 25 red chips and 25 blue chips on the \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one red chip and one blue chip is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",902,"[902, '902']",False
