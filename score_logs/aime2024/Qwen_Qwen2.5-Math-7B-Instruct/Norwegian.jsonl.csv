"To determine the total time Aya takes to complete her turán, including the time spent at the kafé, we start by setting up equations based on the given information.

First, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the turán is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes spent at the kafé. The time spent walking is the distance divided by the speed, which is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
Multiplying through by 60 to clear the denominators, we get:
\[
\frac{540}{s} + t = 240
\]
Rearranging this equation, we find:
\[
t = 240 - \frac{540}{s}
\]

Next, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s+2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the turán is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes spent at the kafé. The time spent walking is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]
Multiplying through by 60 to clear the denominators, we get:
\[
\frac{540}{s+2} + t = 144
\]
Rearranging this equation, we find:
\[
t = 144 - \frac{540}{s+2}
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \( t \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
240 - \frac{540}{s} = 144 - \frac{540}{s+2}
\]
Subtracting 144 from both sides, we get:
\[
96 - \frac{540}{s} = -\frac{540}{s+2}
\]
Adding \( \frac{540}{s+2} \) to both sides, we get:
\[
96 = \frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s+2}
\]
Finding a common denominator for the right side, we get:
\[
96 = \frac{540(s+2) - 540s}{s(s+2)} = \frac{540s + 1080 - 540s}{s(s+2)} = \frac{1080}{s(s+2)}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \( s(s+2) \), we get:
\[
96s(s+2) = 1080
\]
Dividing both sides by 96, we get:
\[
s(s+2) = \frac{1080}{96} = 11.25
\]
This is a quadratic equation, which we can rewrite as:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
To solve this quadratic equation, we use the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) kilometers per hour.

Now, we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the expression for \( t \):
\[
t = 240 - \frac{540}{2.5} = 240 - 216 = 24
\]

Finally, we need to find the total time Aya takes to complete her turán when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) kilometers per hour. The time spent walking is \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours. Therefore, the total time is:
\[
3 + \frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4
\]
Converting 3.4 hours to minutes, we get:
\[
3.4 \times 60 = 204
\]

Thus, the total time Aya takes to complete her turán, including the time spent at the kafé, is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.","[204, '204']",204,"[204, '204']",True
"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \(D\) with respect to the circle \(\omega\) is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\). Therefore, we have:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(AC\) are the sides of the triangle. We need to find the length of \(AP\). To do this, we use the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle in terms of the sides of the triangle. The length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\) is given by:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC}
\]

Substituting the given side lengths \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we get:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Now, we use the power of point \(D\) again:
\[
DB^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]
\[
(5\sqrt{2})^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]
\[
50 = DA \cdot DP
\]

Since \(AD\) is a segment from \(A\) to \(D\) and \(P\) is the point where \(AD\) intersects the circle again, we can express \(DP\) as \(AP - AD\). Therefore, we have:
\[
50 = DA \cdot (AP - DA)
\]

Let \(AD = x\). Then \(DP = AP - x\), and the equation becomes:
\[
50 = x \cdot (AP - x)
\]

We also know that \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) because \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC}
\]
\[
\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{5\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5}{10}
\]
\[
1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This confirms that \(AD\) is indeed the angle bisector. Using the Angle Bisector Theorem again, we find the ratio in which \(AD\) divides \(BC\):
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Let \(BD = y\) and \(DC = 2y\). Since \(BD + DC = BC\), we have:
\[
y + 2y = 9
\]
\[
3y = 9
\]
\[
y = 3
\]

Thus, \(BD = 3\) and \(DC = 6\).

Now, we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle:
\[
AD^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)
\]
Substituting the given side lengths:
\[
AD^2 = 5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5 + 10)^2}\right)
\]
\[
AD^2 = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{15^2}\right)
\]
\[
AD^2 = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right)
\]
\[
AD^2 = 50 \left(1 - \frac{9}{25}\right)
\]
\[
AD^2 = 50 \left(\frac{16}{25}\right)
\]
\[
AD^2 = 32
\]
\[
AD = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

Substituting \(AD = 4\sqrt{2}\) back into the equation \(50 = DA \cdot (AP - DA)\):
\[
50 = 4\sqrt{2} \cdot (AP - 4\sqrt{2})
\]
\[
50 = 4\sqrt{2} \cdot AP - 32
\]
\[
82 = 4\sqrt{2} \cdot AP
\]
\[
AP = \frac{82}{4\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
AP = \frac{41}{2\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
AP = \frac{41\sqrt{2}}{4}
\]

Thus, \(AP\) is in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 41\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 4\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are not integers, we need to rationalize \(m\):
\[
AP = \frac{41\sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{41\sqrt{2}}{4}
\]

Finally, we find \(m + n\):
\[
m = 41\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
n = 4
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{41}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up in the positions where the original red vertices were. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of ways to color the vertices:**
   Since each vertex can be either red or blue, and there are 8 vertices, the total number of ways to color the vertices is:
   \[
   2^8 = 256
   \]

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   For the octagon to be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up in the positions where the original red vertices were, the blue vertices must form a subset of the vertices that can be rotated to match the original positions of the red vertices. This means that the blue vertices must be in positions that are multiples of some integer \( k \) (where \( k \) is a divisor of 8) when the octagon is rotated.

   The possible values for \( k \) are 1, 2, 4, and 8. However, \( k = 1 \) is not possible because it would mean all vertices are blue, which is not a valid scenario since we need at least one red vertex. Therefore, we only need to consider \( k = 2, 4, \) and \( 8 \).

   - For \( k = 2 \), the blue vertices must be in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7. There are 2 ways to color these vertices (either all blue or all red), but since we need at least one red vertex, there is only 1 way (all red).
   - For \( k = 4 \), the blue vertices must be in positions 1, 5. There are 2 ways to color these vertices (either both blue or both red), but since we need at least one red vertex, there is only 1 way (both red).
   - For \( k = 8 \), the blue vertices must be in position 1. There are 2 ways to color this vertex (either blue or red), but since we need at least one red vertex, there is only 1 way (red).

   Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
   \[
   1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up in the positions where the original red vertices were is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of ways to color the vertices:
   \[
   \frac{3}{256}
   \]

4. **Determine \( m \) and \( n \):**
   In the fraction \(\frac{3}{256}\), \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 256 \). Since 3 and 256 are relatively prime, we have:
   \[
   m + n = 3 + 256 = 259
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{259}

"To find the number of intersection points between the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Compose \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the behavior of \( f(x) \) over this interval:
- If \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq \sin(2 \pi x) \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2 \pi x)| \).
- If \( \sin(2 \pi x) < -\frac{1}{2} \) or \( \sin(2 \pi x) > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 4: Compose \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Now, we need to apply \( g(x) \) to \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \):
- If \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| \).
- If \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) < -\frac{1}{4} \) or \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| - \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 5: Compose \( 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Finally, we multiply by 4:
- If \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| \right) = 1 - 4 |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| \).
- If \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) < -\frac{1}{4} \) or \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 4 \left( |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| - 1 \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Similarly, we analyze \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
- If \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| \).
- If \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) < -\frac{1}{4} \) or \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| - \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 7: Compose \( 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Finally, we multiply by 4:
- If \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| \right) = 1 - 4 |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| \).
- If \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) < -\frac{1}{4} \) or \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = 4 \left( |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| - 1 \).

### Step 8: Find Intersection Points
We need to solve:
\[ 1 - 4 |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| = 4 |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| - 1 \]
\[ 2 = 4 |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| + 4 |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| \]
\[ 1 = |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| + |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| \]

Since \( f(x) \) ranges from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\), \( |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| \) and \( |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| \) also range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). The equation \( |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| + |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| = 1 \) implies that one of them must be 0 and the other must be 1.

### Step 9: Solve for \( x \) and \( y \)
- If \( |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| = 0 \), then \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 0 \), which means \( \sin(2 \pi x) = 0 \). This occurs at \( x = k \) for integer \( k \).
- If \( |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| = 1 \), then \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} \), which means \( \cos(3 \pi y) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). This occurs at \( y = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2k}{3} \) or \( y = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2k}{3} \) for integer \( k \).

### Step 10: Count the Intersections
For each \( x = k \), there are two corresponding \( y \)-values: \( y = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2k}{3} \) and \( y = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2k}{3} \). Since \( x \) ranges from 0 to 1 (one period of \( \sin(2 \pi x) \)), \( k \) can be 0. Therefore, there are 2 intersection points for \( k = 0 \).

Thus, the total number of intersection points is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). We also need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the prime number \( p = 2 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \implies n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \implies n^4 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}. \]
However, \( n^4 \) is always congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, so \( n^4 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) is impossible. Therefore, \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

Next, let's consider the prime number \( p = 5 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \implies n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{25}. \]
We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv 24 \pmod{25} \). We can test the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
\[ n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \implies n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \]
\[ n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \implies n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \]
\[ n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \implies n^4 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}, \]
\[ n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \implies n^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}, \]
\[ n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \implies n^4 \equiv 256 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}. \]
None of these values are congruent to 24 modulo 25, so \( p = 5 \) is not a solution.

Next, let's consider the prime number \( p = 13 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{169} \implies n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{169}. \]
We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv 168 \pmod{169} \). We can use the fact that if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{169} \), then \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{169} \). The order of \( n \) modulo 169 must divide 8, but it cannot be 1, 2, or 4 (since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{169} \)). Therefore, the order must be 8. This means that \( n \) is a primitive 8th root of unity modulo 169. The smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{169} \) is \( m = 33 \) (since \( 33^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{169} \)).

To verify, we can check:
\[ 33^4 = 1185921, \]
\[ 1185921 \div 169 = 7023, \]
\[ 1185921 - 169 \times 7023 = 1185921 - 1185921 = 0. \]
Therefore, \( 33^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{169} \), and the smallest positive integer \( m \) is \( 33 \).

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{33}. \]","[33, '33']",110,"[110, '110']",False
"To find the distance from the point \( I \) inside the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its faces, we need to use the concept of the volume of the tetrahedron and the fact that the point \( I \) is the centroid of the tetrahedron with respect to the given distances.

First, let's denote the volume of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) by \( V \). The volume of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a = AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \) is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & c^2 & b^2 \\
1 & b^2 & c^2 & 0 & a^2 \\
1 & c^2 & b^2 & a^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths, we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
288 V^2 = - \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Next, we perform row operations to simplify the determinant. Subtract the first row from the other rows:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & -41 & 49 & 0 \\
0 & 45 & -89 & -48 \\
0 & 39 & -49 & -89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Now, expand this determinant along the first column:

\[
288 V^2 = - \left( 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 49 & 0 \\
45 & -89 & -48 \\
39 & -49 & -89
\end{vmatrix} \right)
\]

We need to calculate the 3x3 determinant:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 49 & 0 \\
45 & -89 & -48 \\
39 & -49 & -89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Using cofactor expansion along the first row:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 49 & 0 \\
45 & -89 & -48 \\
39 & -49 & -89
\end{vmatrix} = -41 \begin{vmatrix}
-89 & -48 \\
-49 & -89
\end{vmatrix} - 49 \begin{vmatrix}
45 & -48 \\
39 & -89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculate the 2x2 determinants:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-89 & -48 \\
-49 & -89
\end{vmatrix} = (-89)(-89) - (-48)(-49) = 7921 - 2352 = 5569
\]

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
45 & -48 \\
39 & -89
\end{vmatrix} = (45)(-89) - (-48)(39) = -4005 + 1872 = -2133
\]

Substitute these values back into the 3x3 determinant:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 49 & 0 \\
45 & -89 & -48 \\
39 & -49 & -89
\end{vmatrix} = -41 \cdot 5569 - 49 \cdot (-2133) = -228329 + 104417 = -123912
\]

Thus:

\[
288 V^2 = - (-123912) = 123912
\]

Solving for \( V^2 \):

\[
V^2 = \frac{123912}{288} = 429
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
V = \sqrt{429}
\]

The volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron is \( \sqrt{429} \).

The distance from the point \( I \) to each face of the tetrahedron is given by:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}
\]

where \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \) and \( A_4 \) are the areas of the faces. Since \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \), the tetrahedron is symmetric, and all faces are congruent. Therefore, each face has the same area.

The area of one face can be calculated using Heron's formula. For a triangle with sides \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \):

\[

\]

The area \( A \) of the triangle is:

\[
A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

However, since the tetrahedron is symmetric and all faces are congruent, we can use the fact that the total surface area \( A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 4A \).

Given the symmetry and equal edge lengths, we can use the known result for the volume of a tetrahedron with equal edge lengths:

\[
d = \frac{V}{A}
\]

Thus, the distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \frac{\sqrt{429}}{4A}
\]

Given the symmetry and equal edge lengths, we can use the known result for the volume of a tetrahedron with equal edge lengths:

\[
d = \frac{m \sqrt n}{p}
\]

Thus, the distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \frac{m \sqrt n}{p}
\]

Thus, the distance from the point \( I \) to each face of the tetrahedron is:

\[
d = \frac{m \sqrt n}{p}
\]

Thus, the distance from the point \( I \) to each face of the tetrahedron is:

"Given a rectangular box with surface area \(54\) and volume \(23\), we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The dimensions of the box are denoted by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area and volume of the box are given by the equations:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54
\]
\[
abc = 23
\]
We need to find the minimum value of the radius \(r\) of the sphere that can contain the box, which is given by:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}
\]
First, we express \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Using the identity:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
we substitute \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\) to get:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54
\]
Solving for \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we have:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 54
\]
To minimize \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we need to find the minimum value of \(a + b + c\). Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[
a + b + c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc} = 3\sqrt[3]{23}
\]
We will check if this minimum value is achievable. Suppose \(a + b + c = 3\sqrt[3]{23}\). Then:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (3\sqrt[3]{23})^2 - 54 = 9 \cdot 23^{2/3} - 54
\]
We need to verify if there exist \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a + b + c = 3\sqrt[3]{23}\), \(ab + bc + ca = 27\), and \(abc = 23\). These conditions are satisfied if \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - 3\sqrt[3]{23}t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]
By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the divisors of \(-23\), which are \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm 23\). Testing these, we find that \(t = \sqrt[3]{23}\) is a root. Therefore, we can factor the polynomial as:
\[
(t - \sqrt[3]{23})(t^2 + \sqrt[3]{23}t + \sqrt[3]{23^2}) = 0
\]
The quadratic factor \(t^2 + \sqrt[3]{23}t + \sqrt[3]{23^2}\) has no real roots because its discriminant is:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{23})^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt[3]{23^2} = \sqrt[3]{23^2} - 4\sqrt[3]{23^2} = -3\sqrt[3]{23^2} < 0
\]
Thus, the only real root is \(t = \sqrt[3]{23}\), and the other two roots are complex. This means that the box is a cube with side length \(\sqrt[3]{23}\). For a cube, \(a = b = c = \sqrt[3]{23}\), so:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3(\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 3 \cdot 23^{2/3}
\]
Therefore, the radius \(r\) of the sphere is:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{3 \cdot 23^{2/3}}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cdot 23^{1/3}}{2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} \cdot 23^{1/3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3 \cdot 23^{2/3}}{4}
\]
Thus, \(p = 3 \cdot 23^{2/3}\) and \(q = 4\). Since \(23^{2/3}\) is not an integer, we need to express \(23^{2/3}\) in a form that makes \(p\) and \(q\) integers.

"To solve the given equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each logarithmic expression.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the logarithm power rule \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we can rewrite this as:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
Solving for \(\log_x(y)\), we get:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Again, using the logarithm power rule, we can rewrite this as:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
Solving for \(\log_y(x)\), we get:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\):
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

We know that \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\) are reciprocals of each other because \(\log_x(y) \cdot \log_y(x) = 1\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{10}{x} \cdot \frac{5}{2y} = 1
\]

Solving for \(xy\), we multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[
\frac{50}{2xy} = 1
\]

Then, we multiply both sides by \(2xy\):
\[
50 = 2xy
\]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:
\[
xy = 25

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position if the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Let's define \( P(n) \) as follows:
- \( P(n) = 1 \) if \( n \) is a winning position.
- \( P(n) = 0 \) if \( n \) is a losing position.

The base cases are:
- \( P(0) = 0 \) (if there are no brikers left, the player whose turn it is loses).
- \( P(1) = 1 \) (if there is 1 brikka left, the player whose turn it is can take it and win).
- \( P(4) = 1 \) (if there are 4 brikers left, the player whose turn it is can take all 4 and win).

For \( n \geq 5 \), the position \( n \) is a winning position if there exists a move to a losing position. Therefore, we have:
\[ P(n) = 1 \text{ if } P(n-1) = 0 \text{ or } P(n-4) = 0. \]
\[ P(n) = 0 \text{ if } P(n-1) = 1 \text{ and } P(n-4) = 1. \]

We can now compute the values of \( P(n) \) for \( n \) from 5 to 2024 by using the recurrence relation. Let's list the first few values to identify a pattern:
\[
\begin{aligned}

\]

We observe that the sequence \( P(n) \) repeats every 5 terms: \( 1, 1, 0, 1, 1 \). Therefore, \( P(n) = 0 \) if and only if \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

To find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which \( P(n) = 0 \), we need to count the number of integers in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) that are congruent to 3 modulo 5. These integers form an arithmetic sequence: \( 3, 8, 13, \ldots, 2023 \).

The general term of this sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = 3 + (n-1) \cdot 5 = 5n - 2. \]
We need to find the largest integer \( n \) such that \( 5n - 2 \leq 2024 \):
\[ 5n \leq 2026 \]
\[ n \leq \frac{2026}{5} = 405.2. \]
Since \( n \) must be an integer, the largest possible value of \( n \) is 405. Therefore, there are 405 positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which \( P(n) = 0 \).

"To determine the probability that Jen wins the top prize given that she wins a premise, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 different numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \):**

   The number of ways to choose 4 different numbers from 10 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection.

   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \frac{10!}{4! \cdot 6!}
   \]

   Simplifying the factorials:

   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6!}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 6!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 different numbers such that at least 2 of them are 2:**

   We need to consider two cases:
   - **Case 1: Exactly 2 of the numbers are 2.**
   - **Case 2: All 4 numbers are 2.**

   **Case 1: Exactly 2 of the numbers are 2.**

   - Choose 2 positions out of 4 for the number 2: \( \binom{4}{2} \).
   - Choose 2 numbers out of the remaining 8 numbers (since 2 is already chosen): \( \binom{8}{2} \).

   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]

   \[
   \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{8 \times 7}{2 \times 1} = 28
   \]

   Therefore, the number of ways to choose exactly 2 numbers as 2 is:

   \[
   6 \times 28 = 168
   \]

   **Case 2: All 4 numbers are 2.**

   - There is only 1 way to choose all 4 numbers as 2.

   Therefore, the number of ways to choose all 4 numbers as 2 is:

   \[
   1
   \]

   Adding the number of ways from both cases, the total number of ways to choose 4 different numbers such that at least 2 of them are 2 is:

   \[
   168 + 1 = 169
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability that Jen wins a premise:**

   The probability that Jen wins a premise is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:

   \[
   P(\text{win premise}) = \frac{169}{210}
   \]

4. **Calculate the probability that Jen wins the top prize given that she wins a premise:**

   The probability that Jen wins the top prize given that she wins a premise is the ratio of the number of ways to choose all 4 numbers as 2 to the number of ways to choose at least 2 numbers as 2:

   \[
   P(\text{win top prize} \mid \text{win premise}) = \frac{1}{169}

5. **Determine \( m \) and \( n \) and find \( m+n \):**

   Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 169 \). Since 1 and 169 are relatively prime, we have:

   m + n = 1 + 169 = 170

"Given the rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) such that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, we need to find the length of \(CE\). We are given the side lengths \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

First, let's place the rectangles in a coordinate system for convenience. Assume \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (107, 0)\), \(C = (107, 16)\), and \(D = (0, 16)\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, let \(E = (x, 16)\) and \(F = (x + 17, 16)\). The length \(EF = 184\) confirms that \(x + 17 - x = 17\), so \(E\) and \(F\) are correctly placed.

Since \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, the quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic. The center of the circle is the midpoint of the diagonal \(AG\). The coordinates of \(G\) are \((x + 17, 0)\) because \(G\) is directly below \(F\) on the x-axis. The length of the diagonal \(AG\) is:
\[
AG = \sqrt{(x + 17 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = x + 17
\]
The center of the circle is at \(\left(\frac{x + 17}{2}, 8\right)\). The radius \(R\) of the circle is half the length of the diagonal \(AG\):
\[
R = \frac{x + 17}{2}
\]

The distance from the center to point \(D\) (which is \((0, 16)\)) must equal the radius \(R\):
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{x + 17}{2} - 0\right)^2 + (8 - 16)^2} = \frac{x + 17}{2}
\]
Simplifying inside the square root:
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{x + 17}{2}\right)^2 + (-8)^2} = \frac{x + 17}{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{\frac{(x + 17)^2}{4} + 64} = \frac{x + 17}{2}
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
\frac{(x + 17)^2}{4} + 64 = \frac{(x + 17)^2}{4}
\]
Subtracting \(\frac{(x + 17)^2}{4}\) from both sides:
\[
64 = 0
\]
This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the fact that \(A, D, H, G\) are cyclic and the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. The correct approach is to use the power of a point theorem.

The power of point \(C\) with respect to the circle is:
\[
CE \cdot CF = CD \cdot CG
\]
Since \(CD = 16\) and \(CG = x + 17 - 16 = x + 1\), we have:
\[
CE \cdot (CE + 17) = 16 \cdot (x + 1)
\]
We need to find \(x\) using the fact that \(A, D, H, G\) are cyclic. The correct approach is to use the fact that the power of point \(C\) with respect to the circle is:
\[
CE \cdot (CE + 17) = 16 \cdot (x + 1)

The correct approach is to use the fact that the power of point \(C\) with respect to the circle is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of paths on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, and the total number of such paths without any restrictions is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\).

However, we are interested in paths that change direction exactly four times. A change in direction occurs when an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R. If we represent a path as a sequence of R's and U's, we can think of the path as consisting of blocks of consecutive R's and U's. Since the path starts with either an R or a U and changes direction exactly four times, it must consist of five blocks of R's and U's (one block of each type).

Let's consider the two cases: the path starts with an R and the path starts with a U.

**Case 1: The path starts with an R.**
In this case, the path can be represented as RRR...RRR UUU...UUU, where the R's and U's are divided into five blocks. The number of ways to arrange these five blocks is the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 5 for the transitions (or equivalently, the number of ways to choose 1 position out of 5 for the start of the first block of U's). This is given by \(\binom{5}{1} = 5\).

**Case 2: The path starts with a U.**
In this case, the path can be represented as UUU...UUU RRR...RRR, where the U's and R's are divided into five blocks. Similarly, the number of ways to arrange these five blocks is the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 5 for the transitions (or equivalently, the number of ways to choose 1 position out of 5 for the start of the first block of R's). This is also given by \(\binom{5}{1} = 5\).

Since the two cases are mutually exclusive, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is the sum of the number of paths in each case:
\[
5 + 5 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"Given the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the maximum possible real part of this expression.

First, let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:
\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
We can expand this using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\):
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]
Distributing the terms, we get:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 4i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).
\]
Combining the real and imaginary parts, we get:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]
The real part of this expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). To find the maximum value of this real part, we can use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so we have:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"To solve for the inradius of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the arrangement of the circles. The two larger circles with radius 34 are tangent to each other and to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of the triangle. This means that the distance between the centers of these two circles is \(34 + 34 = 68\). The centers of these circles are also at a distance of 34 from the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) respectively.

The smaller circles with radius 1 are arranged in a similar pattern, tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle. The distance between the centers of any two adjacent smaller circles is \(1 + 1 = 2\). The centers of these smaller circles are also at a distance of 1 from the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) respectively.

The total number of smaller circles is 2024, which means there are 1012 pairs of adjacent smaller circles. The distance along the side \(AB\) (or \(BC\)) covered by the centers of the smaller circles is \(1012 \times 2 = 2024\). Since the centers of the smaller circles are 1 unit away from the sides, the length of the side \(AB\) (or \(BC\)) is \(2024 + 2 \times 34 = 2092\).

Now, let's consider the geometry of the triangle. The distance between the centers of the two larger circles is 68, and the distance from the center of each larger circle to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) is 34. This means that the inradius \(r\) of the triangle is the distance from the incenter to the sides, which is the same as the radius of the smaller circles plus the distance from the center of the smaller circles to the sides. Therefore, the inradius \(r\) is \(34 + 1 = 35\).

Thus, the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{35}{1}\), and the sum \(m+n\) is \(35+1 = 36\).

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the smallest real number \(k\) such that \(BD^2 > k\) for all rhombi \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

First, note that since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the coordinates of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be expressed as \((a, b)\), \((-a, b)\), \((-a, -b)\), and \((a, -b)\) respectively. The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2b\), so \(BD^2 = 4b^2\).

Since the points \((a, b)\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1.
\]
Rearranging this equation to solve for \(b^2\), we get:
\[
\frac{b^2}{24} = \frac{a^2}{20} - 1 \implies b^2 = 24\left(\frac{a^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24a^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6a^2}{5} - 24.
\]
Therefore, \(BD^2 = 4b^2 = 4\left(\frac{6a^2}{5} - 24\right) = \frac{24a^2}{5} - 96\).

To find the smallest real number \(k\) such that \(BD^2 > k\) for all \(a\), we need to determine the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{24a^2}{5} - 96\). Since \(a^2 \geq 0\) for all real numbers \(a\), the minimum value of \(\frac{24a^2}{5} - 96\) occurs when \(a^2 = 0\). Substituting \(a^2 = 0\) into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{24 \cdot 0}{5} - 96 = -96.
\]
Thus, the smallest real number \(k\) such that \(BD^2 > k\) for all rhombi is any number less than \(-96\). The largest such number is \(-96\).

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{-96}.

"To determine the number of innbyggeers in Aimeville who eier all four items (a diamaniding, a set of golf clubs, a hagespade, and a pack of sugar cookies), we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's define the following sets:

- \( D \) is the set of innbyggeers who eier a diamaniding.
- \( G \) is the set of innbyggeers who eier a set of golf clubs.
- \( H \) is the set of innbyggeers who eier a hagespade.
- \( S \) is the set of innbyggeers who eier a pack of sugar cookies.

We are given the following information:
- \( |D| = 195 \)
- \( |G| = 367 \)
- \( |H| = 562 \)
- \( |S| = 900 \)
- \( |D \cap G| + |D \cap H| + |D \cap S| + |G \cap H| + |G \cap S| + |H \cap S| = 437 \times 2 = 874 \) (since each of the 437 innbyggeers eier exactly two items)
- \( |D \cap G \cap H| + |D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap H \cap S| + |G \cap H \cap S| = 234 \times 3 = 702 \) (since each of the 234 innbyggeers eier exactly three items)
- \( |D \cap G \cap H \cap S| = x \) (the number of innbyggeers who eier all four items)

The principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets states:
\[
|D \cup G \cup H \cup S| = |D| + |G| + |H| + |S| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap H| - |D \cap S| - |G \cap H| - |G \cap S| - |H \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap H| + |D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap H \cap S| + |G \cap H \cap S| - |D \cap G \cap H \cap S|
\]

We know that the total number of innbyggeers is 900, so:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 874 + 702 - x
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
900 = 1626 - 874 + 702 - x
\]
\[
900 = 1454 - x
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 1454 - 900

\[
x = 554

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \) such that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \), we need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall that the distance \( d \) between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( d = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OIA = 90^\circ \). In a right triangle, the circumradius of the triangle formed by the right angle is half the hypotenuse. Here, the hypotenuse is \( OA \), which is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). Therefore, the circumradius of \( \triangle OIA \) is:
\[
\frac{13}{2}
\]
However, the circumradius of \( \triangle OIA \) is also the distance from \( I \) to the midpoint of \( OA \), which is \( \frac{R}{2} \). This is consistent with our previous calculation.

Next, we use the fact that in a right triangle, the length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse. Therefore, the length of \( AI \) is:
\[
AI = \sqrt{R^2 - d^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2} = \sqrt{169 - 13} = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

Now, we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle. The length of the angle bisector \( AI \) of \( \angle A \) in \( \triangle ABC \) is given by:
\[
AI^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)
\]
However, we can also use the fact that the area of \( \triangle ABC \) can be expressed in two ways: using the circumradius and the inradius. The area \( \Delta \) of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of \( \triangle ABC \). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s \implies abc = 4Rrs = 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 \cdot s = 312s
\]
We also know that:
\[
AI^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)
\]
Since \( AI = 2\sqrt{39} \), we have:
\[
(2\sqrt{39})^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right) \implies 156 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)
\]
We also know that:
\[
s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} \implies 2s = AB + AC + BC
\]
Let \( AB = c \), \( AC = b \), and \( BC = a \). Then:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]
Using the formula for the area in terms of the circumradius and the inradius, we have:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
Since \( \Delta = r \cdot s = 6 \cdot s \), we have:
\[
\frac{abc}{52} = 6s \implies abc = 312s
\]
We also know that:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \implies 2s = a + b + c
\]
Using the identity \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) \), we have:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (2s)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 4s^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We also know that:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4R^2 + 4r^2 + 4Rr = 4 \cdot 13^2 + 4 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 676 + 144 + 312 = 1132
\]
Therefore:
\[
1132 = 4s^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) \implies 566 = 2s^2 - (ab + bc + ca) \implies ab + bc + ca = 2s^2 - 566
\]
We also know that:
\[
bc = AB \cdot AC = x
\]

"To solve for the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.
\]

We need to find integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy both \(a + b + c = 300\) and the equation above. Let's consider the case where two of the variables are equal. Without loss of generality, assume \(a = b\). Then the equations become:

\[
2a + c = 300 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2c + 2a^2c = 3a^2c = 100(a^2 + ac + ac) - 2,000,000.
\]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[
3a^2c = 100a^2 + 200ac - 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
3a^2c - 200ac - 100a^2 + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(a\), we get:

\[
a(3ac - 200c - 100a) + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

Since \(c = 300 - 2a\), substitute \(c\) into the equation:

\[
a(3a(300 - 2a) - 200(300 - 2a) - 100a) + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
a(900a - 6a^2 - 60,000 + 400a - 100a) + 2,000,000 = 0,
\]
\[
a(1200a - 6a^2 - 60,000) + 2,000,000 = 0,
\]
\[
-6a^3 + 1200a^2 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0,
\]
\[
-6(a^3 - 200a^2 + 10,000a - 333,333.33) = 0,
\]
\[
a^3 - 200a^2 + 10,000a - 333,333.33 = 0.
\]

By inspection or using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that \(a = 100\) is a root. Substituting \(a = 100\) into \(c = 300 - 2a\), we get:

\[
c = 300 - 2 \cdot 100 = 100.
\]

Thus, \(a = b = c = 100\) is a solution. Since the equation is symmetric in \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the solutions \((100, 100, 100)\) is the only solution where all three variables are equal.

Therefore, the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given equations is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The points \(A\) and \(B\) are given as \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and the point \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Next, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). A segment \(\overline{PQ}\) from \(\mathcal{F}\) has endpoints \(P = (a, 0)\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q = (0, b)\) on the \(y\)-axis, with the condition that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\). The equation of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[
y = -\frac{b}{a}x + b
\]
For \(C\) to lie on both \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{PQ}\), its coordinates \((x, y)\) must satisfy both equations:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
y = -\frac{b}{a}x + b
\]
Setting the right-hand sides equal to each other, we get:
\[
-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{b}{a}x + b
\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[
\left(-\sqrt{3} + \frac{b}{a}\right)x = b - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{b - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\sqrt{3} + \frac{b}{a}} = \frac{\frac{2b - \sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{b - a\sqrt{3}}{a}} = \frac{a(2b - \sqrt{3})}{2(b - a\sqrt{3})}
\]
Substituting \(x\) back into the equation \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{a(2b - \sqrt{3})}{2(b - a\sqrt{3})}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{-\sqrt{3}a(2b - \sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{3}(b - a\sqrt{3})}{2(b - a\sqrt{3})} = \frac{-2ab\sqrt{3} + 3 + \sqrt{3}b - 3a}{2(b - a\sqrt{3})} = \frac{\sqrt{3}(b - 2ab) + 3(1 - a)}{2(b - a\sqrt{3})}
\]
For \(C\) to not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\), the coordinates \((x, y)\) must not satisfy the equation \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) for any other values of \(a\) and \(b\) except when \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). This means that the coordinates of \(C\) must be such that the denominator \(2(b - a\sqrt{3})\) is zero when \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), but not for any other values of \(a\) and \(b\). This occurs when \(b = a\sqrt{3}\), which implies \(a^2 + (a\sqrt{3})^2 = 1\), or \(a^2 + 3a^2 = 1\), or \(4a^2 = 1\), or \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) (since \(a\) is in the first quadrant). Therefore, \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), and the coordinates of \(C\) are the same as the coordinates of \(B\), which is not possible since \(C\) is different from \(B\). Instead, we need to find the point where the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) intersects the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) at a point other than \(A\) and \(B\).

Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\), we get:
\[
x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4 \implies 16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Since \(C\) is in the first quadrant, we take the positive root:
\[
x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\) back into the equation \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{-\sqrt{3}(3 + \sqrt{13}) + 4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{-3\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39} + 4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{9 + 6\sqrt{13} + 13 + 3 - 6\sqrt{39} + 39}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{64}{64}} = 1
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = 1\), and \(p + q = 1 + 1 = 2\). The final answer is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) has roots \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We can factorize this polynomial as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).
\]
We are asked to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000. First, we rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.
\]
We can consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2(1-x) + x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 2\). The given product is then:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k).
\]
Since \(\omega\) is a root of unity, the polynomial \(P(x)\) evaluated at the roots of unity \(\omega^k\) for \(k=0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) can be interpreted as the values of \(P(x)\) at the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\). The polynomial \(P(x)\) can be written as:
\[
P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.
\]
We need to find the value of the product of \(P(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(x^{13} - 1\). This is equivalent to finding the resultant of the polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(x^{13} - 1\). The resultant of two polynomials \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) is given by:
\[
\text{Res}(f, g) = \prod_{i=1}^m \prod_{j=1}^n (a_i - b_j),
\]
where \(a_i\) are the roots of \(f(x)\) and \(b_j\) are the roots of \(g(x)\). Here, \(f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\) and \(g(x) = x^{13} - 1\). The roots of \(f(x)\) are the solutions to the quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2i}{2} = 1 \pm i.
\]
So, the roots of \(f(x)\) are \(1+i\) and \(1-i\). The resultant of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) is:
\[
\text{Res}(x^2 - 2x + 2, x^{13} - 1) = f(1+i) \cdot f(1-i) \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12} (1+i - \omega^k) \cdot (1-i - \omega^k).
\]
First, we evaluate \(f(1+i)\) and \(f(1-i)\):
\[
f(1+i) = (1+i)^2 - 2(1+i) + 2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 - 2 - 2i + 2 = 1 + 2i - 1 - 2 - 2i + 2 = 0,
\]
\[
f(1-i) = (1-i)^2 - 2(1-i) + 2 = 1 - 2i + i^2 - 2 + 2i + 2 = 1 - 2i - 1 - 2 + 2i + 2 = 0.
\]
Since \(f(1+i) = 0\) and \(f(1-i) = 0\), the product \(f(1+i) \cdot f(1-i) = 0\). Therefore, the resultant is:
\[
\text{Res}(x^2 - 2x + 2, x^{13} - 1) = 0.
\]
This means that the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divisible by 1000. The remainder when this product is divided by 1000 is:

"To determine the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-elegant numbers, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the definition of a \( b \)-elegant number:**
   - A \( b \)-elegant number \( n \) has exactly two digits when expressed in base \( b \).
   - The sum of these two digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

2. **Express \( n \) in base \( b \):**
   - A two-digit number in base \( b \) can be written as \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits such that \( 1 \leq a < b \) and \( 0 \leq c < b \).

   - Substitute \( n = ab + c \) into the equation: \( a + c = \sqrt{ab + c} \).

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the possible choices for the sides of the rectangle.

A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. The sides of the rectangle can be chosen in two ways: either along the sides of the dodecagon or along its diagonals. However, since the problem specifies that each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the diagonals that are parallel to the sides of the dodecagon.

In a regular dodecagon, the diagonals that are parallel to the sides are those that skip 5 vertices (i.e., they connect vertices that are 6 vertices apart in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction). There are 12 such diagonals, and they form a smaller hexagon inside the dodecagon.

To form a rectangle, we need to choose two pairs of parallel sides. There are 6 pairs of parallel sides (one pair for each side of the hexagon), and we can choose any 2 out of these 6 pairs. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of 6 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\):

Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, \(n\) must be even. Let \(n = 2m\). The median is then \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is not an element of the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different.

Let's consider the smallest possible value for \(k\), which is 3 (since if \(k = 2\), the median could be 9). If \(k = 3\), then the list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, a_6, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 27 + a_6 + \cdots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_6 + \cdots + a_{2m} = 3\). Since \(a_1, a_2, a_6, \ldots, a_{2m}\) are positive integers, the only possible values are \(a_1 = a_2 = 1\) and \(a_6 = a_7 = \cdots = a_{2m} = 1\). However, this would make the median 1, which is not possible since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Next, let's consider \(k = 4\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_7, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 36 + a_7 + \cdots + a_{2m} = 30\), which is not possible since \(a_1 + a_2 + a_7 + \cdots + a_{2m}\) would have to be negative.

Next, let's consider \(k = 5\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_8, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 45 + a_8 + \cdots + a_{2m} = 30\), which is not possible since \(a_1 + a_2 + a_8 + \cdots + a_{2m}\) would have to be negative.

Next, let's consider \(k = 6\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_{10}, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 54 + a_{10} + \cdots + a_{2m} = 30\), which is not possible since \(a_1 + a_2 + a_{10} + \cdots + a_{2m}\) would have to be negative.

Next, let's consider \(k = 2\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, a_5, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 18 + a_5 + \cdots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_5 + \cdots + a_{2m} = 12\). Since the median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\) and it is not an element of the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different. The only possible values are \(a_1 = a_2 = 1\) and \(a_5 = a_6 = \cdots = a_{2m} = 2\). This gives us the list \(1, 1, 9, 9, 2, 2, \ldots, 2\). The median is \(\frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2\), which is not an element of the list. The sum of the squares of the elements is \(1^2 + 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^2 = 2 + 81 + 81 + 4m - 8 = 166 + 4m - 8 = 158 + 4m\). Since \(n = 2m\) and the sum of the elements is 30, we have \(1 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 2m - 4 = 30\), so \(2m = 12\) and \(m = 6\). Therefore, the sum of the squares of the elements is \(158 + 4 \cdot 6 = 158 + 24 = 182\).

The sum of the squares of all elements in the list is \(\boxed{182}\).","[182, '182']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a 2x3 grid of digits such that the sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by reading from left to right is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by reading from top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The two three-digit numbers formed by reading from left to right are \(abc\) and \(def\). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
\]

The three two-digit numbers formed by reading from top to bottom are \(ad\), \(be\), and \(cf\). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
\]

We can simplify these equations by grouping the terms involving \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\):

\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
\]
\[
10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99
\]

Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the terms involving \(b\) and \(f\):

\[
(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f) = 999 - 99
\]
\[
90a + c + 99d + 9e - 9c = 900
\]
\[
90a + 99d + 9e - 9c = 900
\]
\[
10a + 11d + e - c = 100
\]

Now, we need to find integer values for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) that satisfy both original equations. Let's start by testing some values for \(d\).

If \(d = 9\), then:

\[
10a + 11(9) + e - c = 100
\]
\[
10a + 99 + e - c = 100
\]
\[
10a + e - c = 1
\]

We also have:

\[
10a + 9 + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
\]
\[
10a + 10b + 10c + e + f = 90
\]

Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the terms involving \(e\):

\[
(10a + e - c) - (10a + 10b + 10c + e + f) = 1 - 90
\]
\[
-11c - 10b - f = -89
\]
\[
11c + 10b + f = 89
\]

Now we have two equations:

1. \(10a + e - c = 1\)
2. \(11c + 10b + f = 89\)

Let's test some values for \(c\). If \(c = 8\), then:

\[
10a + e - 8 = 1
\]
\[
10a + e = 9
\]

And:

\[
11(8) + 10b + f = 89
\]
\[
88 + 10b + f = 89
\]
\[
10b + f = 1
\]

The only solution to \(10b + f = 1\) is \(b = 0\) and \(f = 1\). Substituting \(b = 0\) and \(f = 1\) into \(10a + e = 9\), we get:

\[
10a + e = 9
\]

The only solution to \(10a + e = 9\) is \(a = 0\) and \(e = 9\). Therefore, the digits in the grid are:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We can verify that these values satisfy both original equations:

\[
100(0) + 10(0) + 8 + 100(9) + 10(9) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 8 + 900 + 90 + 1 = 999
\]
\[
10(0) + 9 + 10(0) + 9 + 10(8) + 1 = 0 + 9 + 0 + 9 + 80 + 1 = 99
\]

Both equations are satisfied, so the solution is:

"To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by expressing each equation in exponential form. The first equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(yz\) gives:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz
\]

The second equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(xz\) gives:

\[
y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz
\]

The third equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(xy\) gives:

\[
z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz\)
2. \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\)
3. \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\)

We can substitute the expression for \(y\) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot (2^{1/3} \cdot xz)z = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot xz^2
\]

Dividing both sides by \(x\) (since \(x \neq 0\)) gives:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot z^2
\]

We know that \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
1 = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot z^2 = 2^{1/2 + 1/3} \cdot z^2 = 2^{5/6} \cdot z^2
\]

Dividing both sides by \(2^{5/6}\) gives:

\[
z^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\[
z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

Next, we substitute \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into the second equation:

\[
y = 2^{1/3} \cdot x \cdot 2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/3 - 5/12} \cdot x = 2^{4/12 - 5/12} \cdot x = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x
\]

So, we have \(y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x\). Now we substitute \(y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into the first equation:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot (2^{-1/12} \cdot x) \cdot 2^{-5/12} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{-1/12 - 5/12} \cdot x = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{-6/12} \cdot x = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{-1/2} \cdot x = x
\]

This confirms our expressions for \(y\) and \(z\). Now we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4y^3z^2 = x^4 \cdot (2^{-1/12} \cdot x)^3 \cdot (2^{-5/12})^2 = x^4 \cdot 2^{-3/12} \cdot x^3 \cdot 2^{-10/12} = x^7 \cdot 2^{-13/12}
\]

Since \(x = 2^{5/12}\), we substitute \(x\) into the expression:

\[
x^7 = (2^{5/12})^7 = 2^{35/12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{35/12} \cdot 2^{-13/12} = 2^{35/12 - 13/12} = 2^{22/12} = 2^{11/6}
\]

Therefore, we find:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \left|\log_2(2^{11/6})\right| = \left|\frac{11}{6}\right| = \frac{11}{6}
\]

The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 11 and 6, respectively. Thus, \(m+n = 11+6 = 17\).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"Given a convex hexagon \(ABCDEF\) where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, we can express the lengths of the sides as follows: \(AB = a\), \(BC = b\), \(CD = c\), \(DE = a\), \(EF = b\), and \(FA = c\). This is because the hexagon is centrally symmetric, meaning that each pair of opposite sides are equal in length.

We are given that the sides of a triangle formed by extending the segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is formed by the lines \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) extended, and the lengths of these sides are equal to the sums of the lengths of the segments they intersect. Specifically, the side of the triangle corresponding to \(AB\) is \(AB + DE = a + a = 2a\), the side corresponding to \(CD\) is \(CD + EF = c + b\), and the side corresponding to \(EF\) is \(EF + FA = b + c\).

We can set up the following equations based on the given side lengths of the triangle:
\[
2a = 200, \quad b + c = 240, \quad b + c = 300.
\]
From the first equation, we solve for \(a\):
\[
a = \frac{200}{2} = 100.
\]
From the second and third equations, we see that there is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the problem statement. However, if we consider the problem statement correctly, we should recheck the problem statement. The problem statement is correct. The problem statement is correct.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the set \( A \) such that the number of non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers where the largest element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \) is 2024. Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the number of non-empty subsets of positive integers where the largest element is \( a_i \) is \( 2^{a_i-1} \). This is because any subset of positive integers where the largest element is \( a_i \) can include any combination of the elements \( 1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1 \), and there are \( 2^{a_i-1} \) such combinations (including the empty set, but we exclude the empty set here).

Therefore, the total number of non-empty subsets \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets for each element in \( A \):
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

We need to find the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) that satisfy this equation. First, we express 2024 in binary:
\[
2024_{10} = 11111100100_2
\]

This binary representation tells us that:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2
\]

From this, we can see that the exponents in the binary representation correspond to the elements of \( A \) minus 1. Therefore, the elements of \( A \) are:
\[
a_1 = 10 + 1 = 11, \quad a_2 = 9 + 1 = 10, \quad a_3 = 8 + 1 = 9, \quad a_4 = 7 + 1 = 8, \quad a_5 = 6 + 1 = 7, \quad a_6 = 3 + 1 = 4, \quad a_7 = 2 + 1 = 3
\]

The sum of the elements in \( A \) is:
\[
11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 3
\]

We can calculate this sum step by step:
\[
11 + 10 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 9 = 30
\]
\[
30 + 8 = 38
\]
\[
38 + 7 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 4 = 49
\]
\[
49 + 3 = 52

"To solve for the largest four-digit positive integer \( N \) such that when any of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7, we start by expressing \( N \) in its general form as \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits.

We need to check the divisibility condition for each digit when it is changed to 1. This gives us the following congruences:
1. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

From the second congruence, we can see that \( d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), so \( d \) must be one of the digits 0, 7. We will check both cases.

**Case 1: \( d = 0 \)**

The congruences simplify to:
1. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

From the second congruence, we have \( 1000a + 100b + 10c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \). We need to find the remainders of 1000, 100, and 10 when divided by 7:
\[ 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

So, the congruence \( 1000a + 100b + 10c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \) becomes:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

We also have the congruence \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), which simplifies to:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

This is a contradiction because \( 6a + 2b + 3c \) cannot be both 0 and 6 modulo 7. Therefore, \( d \) cannot be 0.

**Case 2: \( d = 7 \)**

The congruences simplify to:
1. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

From the second congruence, we have \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), which simplifies to:
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

This is the same as the congruence we had in Case 1. So, we need to solve:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

We also have the congruence \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), which simplifies to:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

This is a contradiction because \( 6a + 2b + 3c \) cannot be both 0 and 6 modulo 7. Therefore, \( d \) cannot be 7.

We need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that \( 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \). We start with the largest possible value for \( a \), which is 9. We then try to find \( b \) and \( c \) such that \( 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \).

If \( a = 9 \), then:
\[ 6 \cdot 9 + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

We need to find the largest possible values for \( b \) and \( c \) that satisfy this congruence. We start with \( b = 9 \):
\[ 2 \cdot 9 + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 18 + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 18 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 4 + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c \equiv -3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 4 \cdot 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 20 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

So, the largest possible values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are 9, 9, and 6, respectively. Therefore, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is:
\[ N = 9967 \]

To find \( Q \) and \( R \), we divide 9967 by 1000:
\[ 9967 \div 1000 = 9 \text{ remainder } 967 \]
So, \( Q = 9 \) and \( R = 967 \).

Finally, we find \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 9 + 967 = 976 \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{976} \]","[976, '976']",699,"[699, '699']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles formed by the intersection of the torus \( T \) with the sphere \( S \) when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, and the sphere has a radius of 11.

First, let's consider the case when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 + 3 = 9. When the torus intersects the sphere, it forms a circle whose radius is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency minus the radius of the torus. This distance is the same as the radius of the sphere minus the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, which is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \). Therefore, the radius of the circle formed by the intersection is \( \sqrt{3^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{9 - 4} = \sqrt{5} \). So, \( r_i = \sqrt{5} \).

Next, let's consider the case when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 - 3 = 3. When the torus intersects the sphere, it forms a circle whose radius is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency plus the radius of the torus. This distance is the same as the radius of the sphere minus the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, which is \( 11 - 3 = 8 \). Therefore, the radius of the circle formed by the intersection is \( \sqrt{3^2 - 8^2} = \sqrt{9 - (-5^2)} = \sqrt{9 + 25} = \sqrt{34} \). So, \( r_o = \sqrt{34} \).

The difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is \( \sqrt{34} - \sqrt{5} \). To express this difference as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), we need to rationalize the expression. However, since \( \sqrt{34} - \sqrt{5} \) is already in its simplest form and cannot be simplified further as a fraction of integers, we conclude that \( m = \sqrt{34} - \sqrt{5} \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m = 34 - 5 = 29 \) and \( n = 1 \), and the sum \( m + n = 29 + 1 = 30 \).

The correct answer is \( \boxed{30} \).","[30, '30']",127,"[127, '127']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 25 white and 25 black bricks into a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one brick, all bricks in the same row and all bricks in the same column have the same color, and any extra bricks placed on the grid will break one or both of these conditions.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the possible configurations:**
   - We can place either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 bricks in each row and each column.
   - If we place 0 bricks in a row or column, it will not affect the other rows or columns.
   - If we place 1 brick in a row or column, it must be in a unique cell in that row or column.
   - If we place 2 bricks in a row or column, they must be in the same cell in that row or column.
   - If we place 3 bricks in a row or column, they must be in the same cell in that row or column.
   - If we place 4 bricks in a row or column, they must be in the same cell in that row or column.

2. **Count the number of ways to place the bricks:**
   - If we place 0 bricks, there is only 1 way to do this.
   - If we place 1 brick, we can choose any of the 25 cells to place it in. There are 25 ways to do this.
   - If we place 2 bricks, they must be in the same cell, so there are 25 ways to do this.
   - If we place 3 bricks, they must be in the same cell, so there are 25 ways to do this.
   - If we place 4 bricks, they must be in the same cell, so there are 25 ways to do this.

3. **Consider the color constraints:**
   - If we place 0 bricks, there is only 1 way to do this.
   - If we place 1 brick, it can be either white or black, so there are 2 ways to do this.
   - If we place 2 bricks, they must be the same color, so there are 2 ways to do this (either both white or both black).
   - If we place 3 bricks, they must be the same color, so there are 2 ways to do this (either all white or all black).
   - If we place 4 bricks, they must be the same color, so there are 2 ways to do this (either all white or all black).

4. **Sum up the number of ways:**
   - For 0 bricks: \(1\)
   - For 1 brick: \(2\)
   - For 2 bricks: \(2\)
   - For 3 bricks: \(2\)
   - For 4 bricks: \(2\)

   Adding these together, we get:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways to place some of the 25 white and 25 black bricks into a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one brick, all bricks in the same row and all bricks in the same column have the same color, and any extra bricks placed on the grid will break one or both of these conditions is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",902,"[902, '902']",True
