"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time \( t \) that Aya spends in the park when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour. We start by setting up equations based on the given information.

First, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time she spends on the прогулянка is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in the park. The time spent walking is the total time minus the time spent in the park. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, \( t \) minutes is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Therefore, the time spent walking is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance covered while walking is the speed multiplied by the time spent walking, which is \( s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) \) kilometers. We know this distance is 9 kilometers, so we can write the equation:
\[
s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9
\]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[
4s - \frac{st}{60} = 9
\]
Multiplying through by 60 to clear the fraction, we obtain:
\[
240s - st = 540
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
st = 240s - 540 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time she spends on the прогулянка is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes in the park. Converting 2 hours and 24 minutes to hours, we get \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours. Therefore, the time spent walking is \( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance covered while walking is the speed multiplied by the time spent walking, which is \( (s + 2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) \) kilometers. We know this distance is 9 kilometers, so we can write the equation:
\[
(s + 2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) = 9
\]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[
2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60} = 9
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st + 2t}{60} = 9
\]
Multiplying through by 60 to clear the fraction, we obtain:
\[
144s + 288 - st - 2t = 540
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-st - 2t = 540 - 144s - 288
\]
Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
-st - 2t = 252 - 144s
\]
Factoring out \( t \) on the left side, we get:
\[
t(-s - 2) = 252 - 144s
\]
Solving for \( t \), we get:
\[
t = \frac{252 - 144s}{-s - 2} = \frac{144s - 252}{s + 2} \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now, we substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to find \( s \):
\[
s \left(\frac{144s - 252}{s + 2}\right) = 240s - 540
\]
Multiplying both sides by \( s + 2 \) to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
s(144s - 252) = (240s - 540)(s + 2)
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
144s^2 - 252s = 240s^2 + 480s - 540s - 1080
\]
Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
144s^2 - 252s = 240s^2 - 60s - 1080
\]
Rearranging terms to bring all terms to one side, we get:
\[
0 = 96s^2 + 192s - 1080
\]
Dividing through by 96, we get:
\[
0 = s^2 + 2s - 11.25
\]
This is a quadratic equation. We solve it using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) kilometers per hour.

Now, we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into equation (2) to find \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{144(2.5) - 252}{2.5 + 2} = \frac{360 - 252}{4.5} = \frac{108}{4.5} = 24
\]

Finally, we need to find the time Aya spends on thepromuлянка when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) kilometers per hour. The time spent walking is:
\[
4 - \frac{t}{60} = 4 - \frac{24}{60} = 4 - 0.4 = 3.6 \text{ hours}
\]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[
3 \times 3.6 = 10.8 \text{ kilometers}
\]
Since the distance is 9 kilometers, the time spent in the park is:
\[
t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time Aya spends on thepromuлянка, including \( t \) minutes in the park, is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"Given a triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), the tangents to \(\omega\) at points \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\), and the line \(\overline{AD}\) intersects \(\omega\) again at point \(P\). We are given \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), and we need to find the length of \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, and then determine \(m + n\).

First, we use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the power of \(D\) with respect to the circle is the same for any two intersecting chords through \(D\). Here, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is \(DB^2 = DC^2\). Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), \(DB = DC\).

Next, we use the fact that \(AD\) is the symmedian of \(\triangle ABC\). The symmedian divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{BP}{PC} = \left(\frac{AB}{AC}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{10}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
\]
This means that \(BP = \frac{1}{5}BC = \frac{1}{5} \cdot 9 = \frac{9}{5}\) and \(PC = \frac{4}{5}BC = \frac{4}{5} \cdot 9 = \frac{36}{5}\).

Now, we use the fact that \(AP\) is a symmedian, and the length of the symmedian can be found using the formula:
\[
AP^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
AP^2 = 5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5 + 10)^2}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{15^2}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{9}{25}\right) = 50 \left(\frac{16}{25}\right) = 32
\]
Therefore, \(AP = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\).

To express \(4\sqrt{2}\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), we note that \(4\sqrt{2}\) is already in its simplest form with \(m = 4\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 1\). However, since \(m\) and \(n\) must be integers, we need to rationalize the expression. Instead, we should re-evaluate the problem to find the correct rational form.

"To determine the probability that a regular octagon can be rotated so that all sinny vertices move to the positions where the original black vertices were, we need to analyze the possible colorings of the octagon and the conditions under which such a rotation is possible.

First, let's consider the total number of possible colorings of the octagon. Since each vertex can be either black or red, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of colorings that allow the octagon to be rotated so that all sinny vertices move to the positions of the original black vertices. This means that the number of sinny vertices must be equal to the number of black vertices, and they must be arranged in such a way that a rotation of the octagon by some angle (which is a multiple of \(45^\circ\)) will map each sinny vertex to a black vertex.

The only possible number of sinny vertices (and black vertices) that satisfies this condition is 4. This is because the octagon has 8 vertices, and the only divisor of 8 that is less than or equal to 4 is 4. If there were 0, 1, 2, or 3 sinny vertices, it would not be possible to rotate the octagon so that all sinny vertices move to the positions of the original black vertices.

Now, let's count the number of ways to color the octagon with exactly 4 sinny vertices. This is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of 8 to be sinny. The value of \(\binom{8}{4}\) is:
\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70
\]

Therefore, there are 70 colorings of the octagon that allow it to be rotated so that all sinny vertices move to the positions of the original black vertices.

The probability of such a coloring is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of possible colorings:
\[
\frac{70}{256} = \frac{35}{128}
\]

Since 35 and 128 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the fraction \(\frac{35}{128}\) is in its simplest form. Therefore, \(m = 35\) and \(n = 128\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 35 + 128 = 163
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{163}

"To find the number of points of intersection of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Compose the functions
We need to find \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) will range from \(0\) to \(1\).
- Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Similarly, we need to find \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):
- Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) will range from \(0\) to \(1\).
- Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Step 4: Set up the equations
We need to solve:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]

Since both \( y \) and \( x \) range from \(0\) to \(2\), we need to find the points where these equations intersect within this range.

### Step 5: Analyze the intersections
For \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) to intersect, we need:
\[ 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]
\[ g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]

This implies:
\[ f(\sin (2 \pi x)) = f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \]

### Step 6: Solve \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) = f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \)
We need to consider the cases for \( f(x) \):
1. \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin (2 \pi x)| \) and \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos (3 \pi y)| \)
2. \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) = |\sin (2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) = |\cos (3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \)

For the first case:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - |\sin (2 \pi x)| = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos (3 \pi y)| \]
\[ |\sin (2 \pi x)| = |\cos (3 \pi y)| \]

For the second case:
\[ |\sin (2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} = |\cos (3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ |\sin (2 \pi x)| = |\cos (3 \pi y)| \]

Thus, we need to solve:
\[ |\sin (2 \pi x)| = |\cos (3 \pi y)| \]

### Step 7: Solve \( |\sin (2 \pi x)| = |\cos (3 \pi y)| \)
The equation \( |\sin (2 \pi x)| = |\cos (3 \pi y)| \) has solutions:
\[ \sin (2 \pi x) = \cos (3 \pi y) \quad \text{or} \quad \sin (2 \pi x) = -\cos (3 \pi y) \]

Using the identity \( \cos (3 \pi y) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y \right) \), we get:
\[ \sin (2 \pi x) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y \right) \]
\[ \sin (2 \pi x) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y \right) \]

For \( \sin (2 \pi x) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y \right) \):
\[ 2 \pi x = \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad 2 \pi x = \pi - \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y \right) + 2k\pi \]
\[ 2 \pi x = \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad 2 \pi x = \frac{\pi}{2} + 3 \pi y + 2k\pi \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{2} y + k \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} y + k \]

For \( \sin (2 \pi x) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y \right) \):
\[ 2 \pi x = -\left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y \right) + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad 2 \pi x = \pi + \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y \right) + 2k\pi \]
\[ 2 \pi x = -\frac{\pi}{2} + 3 \pi y + 2k\pi \quad \text{or} \quad 2 \pi x = \frac{3\pi}{2} - 3 \pi y + 2k\pi \]
\[ x = -\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} y + k \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{2} y + k \]

### Step 8: Count the number of solutions within the range \(0 \leq x, y \leq 2\)
For each \( k \), we need to check if the solutions fall within the range \(0 \leq x, y \leq 2\).

For \( x = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{2} y + k \):
\[ 0 \leq \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{2} y + k \leq 2 \]
\[ -\frac{1}{4} - k \leq -\frac{3}{2} y \leq \frac{7}{4} - k \]
\[ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{k}{3} \geq y \geq -\frac{7}{6} + \frac{k}{3} \]

For \( x = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} y + k \):
\[ 0 \leq \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} y + k \leq 2 \]
\[ -\frac{1}{4} - k \leq \frac{3}{2} y \leq \frac{7}{4} - k \]
\[ -\frac{1}{6} - \frac{k}{3} \leq y \leq \frac{7}{6} - \frac{k}{3} \]

For \( x = -\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{2} y + k \):

"To find the smallest prime number \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), we start by examining the congruence \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \), so the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, and 8. However, since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the order cannot be 1, 2, or 4. Therefore, the order must be 8.

This means that \( n \) is a primitive 8th root of unity modulo \( p^2 \). The polynomial whose roots are the primitive 8th roots of unity is \( x^4 + 1 \). For \( x^4 + 1 \) to have a root modulo \( p^2 \), \( p^2 \) must divide the discriminant of the polynomial \( x^4 + 1 \) when it is factored over the integers. The polynomial \( x^4 + 1 \) can be factored as \( (x^2 + \sqrt{2}x + 1)(x^2 - \sqrt{2}x + 1) \) over the integers, but we need to consider it modulo \( p^2 \).

The discriminant of \( x^4 + 1 \) is \( 256 \), and we need \( p^2 \) to divide \( 256 \). The prime factorization of 256 is \( 2^8 \), so the only prime \( p \) that satisfies this condition is \( p = 2 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \). We check the values of \( m \) modulo 4:
- If \( m \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).

None of these values satisfy \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \) except when we consider the next power of 2, which is \( p = 2 \). We need to check the values of \( m \) modulo 8:

- If \( m \equiv 3 \pmod{16} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{16} \).

"Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the distance from the point \(I\) (the incenter) to any of the faces of the tetrahedron, which can be expressed as \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\). We need to determine \(m+n+p\).

First, we calculate the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \(a = AB\), \(b = AC\), \(c = AD\), \(d = BC\), \(e = BD\), and \(f = CD\) is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), \(c = \sqrt{89}\), \(d = \sqrt{89}\), \(e = \sqrt{80}\), and \(f = \sqrt{41}\), we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we find:

\[
288 V^2 = 288 \cdot 841
\]

Thus,

\[
V^2 = 841 \implies V = 29
\]

Next, we calculate the areas of the faces of the tetrahedron. The area of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by Heron's formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. For face \(ABC\):

\[
s_{ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

\[
\text{Area}_{ABC} = \sqrt{s_{ABC}(s_{ABC} - \sqrt{41})(s_{ABC} - \sqrt{80})(s_{ABC} - \sqrt{89})}
\]

Using the same formula for the other faces, we find:

\[
\text{Area}_{ABD} = \text{Area}_{ACD} = \text{Area}_{BCD} = \sqrt{s_{ABD}(s_{ABD} - \sqrt{41})(s_{ABD} - \sqrt{80})(s_{ABD} - \sqrt{89})}
\]

The total surface area \(S\) of the tetrahedron is the sum of the areas of its four faces. The inradius \(r\) of the tetrahedron is given by:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} S r
\]

Solving for \(r\), we get:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{S}
\]

After calculating the areas of the faces and summing them up, we find:

\[
S = 4 \cdot \sqrt{841} = 4 \cdot 29 = 116
\]

Thus,

\[
r = \frac{3 \cdot 29}{116} = \frac{87}{116} = \frac{3 \sqrt{89}}{4}
\]

Therefore, \(m = 3\), \(n = 89\), and \(p = 4\), and the sum \(m+n+p\) is:

\[
m+n+p = 3+89+4 = 96

"Given a rectangular box with surface area \(54\) and volume \(23\), we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The dimensions of the box are denoted by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area and volume of the box are given by the equations:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54
\]
\[
abc = 23
\]
We need to find the minimum value of the diagonal of the box, which is given by:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]
First, we express \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Using the identity:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
we substitute \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\) to get:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54
\]
Solving for \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we have:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 54
\]
To minimize \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we need to find the minimum value of \(a + b + c\). Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[
a + b + c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc} = 3\sqrt[3]{23}
\]
We need to check if this minimum value is achievable. Suppose \(a = b = c = \sqrt[3]{23}\). Then:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 2(\sqrt[3]{23} \cdot \sqrt[3]{23} + \sqrt[3]{23} \cdot \sqrt[3]{23} + \sqrt[3]{23} \cdot \sqrt[3]{23}) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot (\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 6 \cdot 23^{2/3}
\]
We need to check if \(6 \cdot 23^{2/3} = 54\). This is equivalent to checking if \(23^{2/3} = 9\), or \(23^{2} = 9^3 = 729\). Since \(23^2 = 529\), \(23^{2/3} \neq 9\). Therefore, \(a = b = c = \sqrt[3]{23}\) is not a solution.

Next, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) subject to the constraints \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\) and \(abc = 23\). The Lagrangian function is:
\[
\mathcal{L}(a, b, c, \lambda, \mu) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + \lambda (2(ab + bc + ca) - 54) + \mu (abc - 23)
\]
Taking the partial derivatives and setting them to zero, we get:
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a} = 2a + \lambda (2b + 2c) + \mu bc = 0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b} = 2b + \lambda (2a + 2c) + \mu ac = 0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c} = 2c + \lambda (2a + 2b) + \mu ab = 0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = 2(ab + bc + ca) - 54 = 0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mu} = abc - 23 = 0
\]
From the first three equations, we can express \(\lambda\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
2a + 2\lambda b + 2\lambda c + \mu bc = 0 \implies a + \lambda b + \lambda c + \frac{\mu bc}{2} = 0
\]
\[
2b + 2\lambda a + 2\lambda c + \mu ac = 0 \implies b + \lambda a + \lambda c + \frac{\mu ac}{2} = 0
\]
\[
2c + 2\lambda a + 2\lambda b + \mu ab = 0 \implies c + \lambda a + \lambda b + \frac{\mu ab}{2} = 0
\]
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
\[
a - b + \frac{\mu bc - \mu ac}{2} = 0 \implies a - b + \frac{\mu c(b - a)}{2} = 0 \implies (a - b)(1 - \frac{\mu c}{2}) = 0
\]
This implies either \(a = b\) or \(\mu c = 2\). Similarly, we can show that either \(b = c\) or \(\mu a = 2\), and either \(c = a\) or \(\mu b = 2\). Therefore, either \(a = b = c\) or two of the variables are equal and the third is different.

If \(a = b\), then \(c = \frac{23}{a^2}\) and the surface area equation becomes:
\[
2(a^2 + a \cdot \frac{23}{a^2} + a \cdot \frac{23}{a^2}) = 54 \implies 2(a^2 + \frac{46}{a}) = 54 \implies a^2 + \frac{23}{a} = 27

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each logarithmic expression.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ x \log_x(y) = 10. \]
By the change of base formula, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), so the equation becomes:
\[ x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\log(x)\), we get:
\[ x \log(y) = 10 \log(x). \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}. \]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ 4y \log_y(x) = 10. \]
By the change of base formula, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), so the equation becomes:
\[ 4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\log(y)\), we get:
\[ 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y). \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}. \]

Now we have two equations:
\[ \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}, \]
\[ \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}. \]

Multiplying these two equations together, we get:
\[ \left(\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\right) \left(\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\right) = \left(\frac{10}{x}\right) \left(\frac{5}{2y}\right). \]
The left side simplifies to 1, so we have:
\[ 1 = \frac{50}{2xy}. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(2xy\), we get:
\[ 2xy = 50. \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position if the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Let's define \( L \) as a losing position and \( W \) as a winning position. The base cases are:
- \( n = 0 \) is a losing position because the player who faces 0 Jennifer is already dead.
- \( n = 1 \) is a winning position because the player can take the 1 Jennifer and win.
- \( n = 2 \) is a winning position because the player can take 1 Jennifer and leave the opponent with 1 Jennifer, which is a winning position.
- \( n = 3 \) is a winning position because the player can take 1 Jennifer and leave the opponent with 2 Jennifer, which is a winning position.
- \( n = 4 \) is a losing position because the player can only take 1 or 4 Jennifer, leaving the opponent with 3 or 0 Jennifer, both of which are winning positions.

Now, let's determine the positions for \( n \geq 5 \). A position \( n \) is a losing position if all moves from \( n \) lead to a winning position. Therefore, we need to check the positions \( n-1 \) and \( n-4 \):
- If \( n-1 \) is a winning position, then \( n \) is a losing position.
- If \( n-4 \) is a winning position, then \( n \) is a losing position.

Using this logic, we can extend the pattern:
- \( n = 5 \) is a winning position because \( n-1 = 4 \) is a losing position.
- \( n = 6 \) is a winning position because \( n-1 = 5 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 7 \) is a winning position because \( n-1 = 6 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 8 \) is a losing position because \( n-4 = 4 \) is a losing position.
- \( n = 9 \) is a winning position because \( n-4 = 5 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 10 \) is a winning position because \( n-4 = 6 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 11 \) is a winning position because \( n-4 = 7 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 12 \) is a losing position because \( n-4 = 8 \) is a losing position.

We observe that the losing positions are \( n = 4, 8, 12, \ldots \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4 and common difference 4. The general form of the \( k \)-th term of this sequence is:
\[ n = 4k \]

We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) that are of the form \( 4k \). This is equivalent to finding the largest integer \( k \) such that:
\[ 4k \leq 2024 \]
\[ k \leq \frac{2024}{4} \]
\[ k \leq 506 \]

Therefore, \( k \) can take any integer value from 1 to 506, inclusive. The number of such integers is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that Дenny wins the top prize given that she wins the prize. This is a conditional probability problem, which can be expressed as:

\[ P(\text{top prize} \mid \text{prize}) = \frac{P(\text{top prize})}{P(\text{prize})} \]

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \):

\[ \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210 \]

Next, we calculate the probability of winning the top prize. This occurs when all 4 numbers Denny chooses are the same 4 numbers that were chosen randomly. There is only 1 way to choose the same 4 numbers that were chosen randomly out of the 210 possible combinations. Therefore, the probability of winning the top prize is:

\[ P(\text{top prize}) = \frac{1}{210} \]

Now, we calculate the probability of winning the prize. This occurs when at least 2 of the 4 numbers Denny chooses are the same 2 numbers that were chosen randomly. We can use the complement rule to find this probability. The complement of winning the prize is winning 0 or 1 of the 2 specific numbers.

1. **Probability of winning 0 of the 2 specific numbers:**
   Denny must choose all 4 numbers from the remaining 8 numbers. The number of ways to do this is \( \binom{8}{4} \):

   \[ \binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70 \]

   Therefore, the probability of winning 0 of the 2 specific numbers is:

   \[ P(\text{0 specific numbers}) = \frac{70}{210} = \frac{1}{3} \]

2. **Probability of winning 1 of the 2 specific numbers:**
   Denny must choose 1 of the 2 specific numbers and 3 of the remaining 8 numbers. The number of ways to do this is \( \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{8}{3} \):

   \[ \binom{2}{1} = 2 \]
   \[ \binom{8}{3} = \frac{8!}{3!5!} = 56 \]
   \[ \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{8}{3} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

   Therefore, the probability of winning 1 of the 2 specific numbers is:

   \[ P(\text{1 specific number}) = \frac{112}{210} = \frac{8}{15} \]

The probability of winning at least 2 of the 2 specific numbers (i.e., winning the prize) is the complement of the probability of winning 0 or 1 of the 2 specific numbers:

\[ P(\text{prize}) = 1 - P(\text{0 specific numbers}) - P(\text{1 specific number}) = 1 - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{8}{15} \]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15:

\[ 1 = \frac{15}{15} \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15} \]
\[ P(\text{prize}) = \frac{15}{15} - \frac{5}{15} - \frac{8}{15} = \frac{2}{15} \]

Now, we can find the conditional probability \( P(\text{top prize} \mid \text{prize}) \):

\[ P(\text{top prize} \mid \text{prize}) = \frac{P(\text{top prize})}{P(\text{prize})} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{2}{15}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{15}{2} = \frac{15}{420} = \frac{1}{28} \]

The fraction \( \frac{1}{28} \) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 28 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 28 = 29 \).

"Given the rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) such that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, we need to find the length of \(CE\). We start by noting that since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is a cyclic quadrilateral. This implies that the opposite angles of \(ADHG\) sum to \(180^\circ\).

First, we calculate the length of the diagonal \(AC\) of rectangle \(ABCD\):
\[
AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 256} = \sqrt{11705} = 108.2.
\]
Next, we calculate the length of the diagonal \(FH\) of rectangle \(EFGH\):
\[
FH = \sqrt{EF^2 + FG^2} = \sqrt{184^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{33856 + 289} = \sqrt{34145} = 184.8.
\]
Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the power of point \(C\) with respect to the circle is the same when considering the segments \(CE\) and \(CF\). The power of point \(C\) is given by:
\[
CE \cdot CF = CA \cdot CH.
\]
We know that \(CA = AC = 108.2\) and \(CH = FH - FC = 184.8 - FC\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(CE = x\) and \(CF = 184.8 - x\). Therefore, we have:
\[
x(184.8 - x) = 108.2 \cdot 184.8.
\]
This is a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 184.8x + 108.2 \cdot 184.8 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -184.8\), and \(c = 108.2 \cdot 184.8\):
\[
x = \frac{184.8 \pm \sqrt{184.8^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 108.2 \cdot 184.8}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{184.8 \pm \sqrt{184.8^2(1 - 4 \cdot 108.2/184.8^2)}}{2} = \frac{184.8 \pm 184.8 \sqrt{1 - 4 \cdot 108.2/184.8^2}}{2}.
\]
Simplifying inside the square root:
\[
1 - 4 \cdot 108.2/184.8^2 = 1 - 4 \cdot 108.2/34145.04 = 1 - 432.8/34145.04 = 1 - 0.01268 = 0.98732.
\]
Thus,
\[
x = \frac{184.8 \pm 184.8 \sqrt{0.98732}}{2} = \frac{184.8 \pm 184.8 \cdot 0.99364}{2} = \frac{184.8 \pm 183.2}{2}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = \frac{184.8 + 183.2}{2} = \frac{368}{2} = 184,
\]
\[
x = \frac{184.8 - 183.2}{2} = \frac{1.6}{2} = 0.8.
\]
Since \(CE\) is a length, it must be positive and greater than the length of \(BC\), which is 16. Therefore, \(CE = 184\).

"To determine the number of paths of length 16 that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, and change direction exactly four times, we need to analyze the structure of such paths.

A path from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U). The total number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\), which represents the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's in a sequence of 16 moves.

However, we are interested in paths that change direction exactly four times. A change in direction occurs when an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R. To have exactly four changes in direction, we need to place four R's and four U's in such a way that there are exactly four transitions from R to U or U to R.

We can represent the path as a sequence of blocks of consecutive R's and U's. Since there are four changes in direction, there must be five blocks in total (one block of R's, one block of U's, one block of R's, one block of U's, and one block of R's or U's). The number of ways to arrange these five blocks is the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 5 for the blocks of R's (or equivalently, the blocks of U's), which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{2}\).

For each arrangement of the blocks, we need to determine the number of ways to distribute the R's and U's within the blocks. Since each block must contain at least one move, we can use the stars and bars method to find the number of ways to distribute the R's and U's. Specifically, we need to find the number of solutions to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 8\) where \(x_i \geq 1\) for all \(i\). This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation \(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5 = 3\) where \(y_i = x_i - 1 \geq 0\), which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{3+5-1}{5-1} = \binom{7}{4}\).

Therefore, the total number of paths is given by:
\[
\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{7}{4} = 10 \times 35 = 350

Thus, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{350}\).","[350, '350']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"Given the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the maximum possible real part of this expression.

First, let's express \(z\) in polar form. Since \(|z| = 4\), we can write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) for some real number \(\theta\). Then, the complex conjugate of \(z\) is \(\overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

We expand both products:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)).
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]

The real part of this expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). To find the maximum value of this real part, we use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so we have:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{(324^2 + (432/2)^2 \cdot 4)} = \sqrt{(324^2 + 216^2 \cdot 4)} = \sqrt{(324^2 + 216^2 \cdot 2^2)} = \sqrt{(324^2 + (216 \cdot 2)^2)} = \sqrt{(324^2 + 432^2)} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"Given that eight circles of radius 34 are tangent to each other and two of these circles are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\), we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\). We are also given that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be placed in the same configuration.

First, let's consider the arrangement of the eight circles of radius 34. The centers of these circles form a regular octagon. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is \(2 \times 34 = 68\). The side length of the octagon is 68.

The circumradius \(R\) of a regular octagon with side length \(s\) is given by:
\[
R = \frac{s}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right)
\]
Substituting \(s = 68\):
\[
R = \frac{68}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) = 34 \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right)
\]

The distance from the center of the octagon to the center of any of the circles is \(R - 34\):
\[
R - 34 = 34 \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) - 34 = 34\sqrt{2}
\]

This distance is also the radius of the circumscribed circle of the triangle formed by the centers of the two circles tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\) and the center of the octagon. The radius of this circumscribed circle is the same as the distance from the incenter of triangle \(ABC\) to any of its sides, which is the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\).

Now, let's consider the arrangement of the 2024 circles of radius 1. The centers of these circles form a smaller regular octagon. The side length of this smaller octagon is \(2 \times 1 = 2\).

The circumradius \(R_1\) of this smaller octagon is:
\[
R_1 = \frac{2}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) = 1 + \sqrt{2}
\]

The distance from the center of the smaller octagon to the center of any of the circles is \(R_1 - 1\):
\[
R_1 - 1 = (1 + \sqrt{2}) - 1 = \sqrt{2}
\]

This distance is also the radius of the circumscribed circle of the triangle formed by the centers of the two circles tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\) and the center of the smaller octagon. The radius of this circumscribed circle is the same as the distance from the incenter of triangle \(ABC\) to any of its sides, which is the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\).

Since the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is the same in both cases, we have:
\[
r = 34\sqrt{2}
\]

However, we need to express \(r\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). Since \(34\sqrt{2}\) is already in its simplest form, we need to rationalize it. The rationalized form of \(34\sqrt{2}\) is:
\[
r = \frac{34\sqrt{2}}{1}
\]

Thus, \(m = 34\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 1\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are not integers, we need to re-equality the rational form of \(34\sqrt{2}\) to rational form.

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the largest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

Since the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles and bisect each other, the coordinates of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be expressed as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\), so \(BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\).

Since \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1\). We can express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\) as follows:
\[
y_1^2 = 24\left(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24x_1^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24.
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_1^2 + \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{5x_1^2 + 6x_1^2}{5} - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11x_1^2}{5} - 24\right) = \frac{44x_1^2}{5} - 96.
\]
To find the largest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi, we need to determine the minimum value of \(\frac{44x_1^2}{5} - 96\). Since \(x_1^2 \geq 20\) (because \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} \geq 1\)), the minimum value of \(x_1^2\) is 20. Substituting \(x_1^2 = 20\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44 \cdot 20}{5} - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80.

We are given the following information:
- \( |A| = 195 \)
- \( |B| = 367 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- \( |D| = 900 \)
- \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 \times 2 = 874 \) (since each resident who eats exactly two types of food is counted twice)
- \( |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 \times 3 = 702 \) (since each resident who eats exactly three types of food is counted three times)
- \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = x \) (the number of residents who eat all four types of food)

The principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets states:

Since every resident eats at least one type of food, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 874 + 702 - x

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OIA = 90^\circ \). In this right triangle, \( OA = R = 13 \) and \( OI = d = \sqrt{13} \). Therefore, the length \( IA \) is:
\[
IA = \sqrt{OA^2 - OI^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2} = \sqrt{169 - 13} = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) is also equal to the radius of the inscribed circle \( r \) times the cotangent of half the angle \( A \):
\[
IA = r \cot \frac{A}{2}
\]
Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
2\sqrt{39} = 6 \cot \frac{A}{2} \implies \cot \frac{A}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{39}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{3}
\]

Using the identity \( \cot \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\cos \frac{A}{2}}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} \), we have:
\[
\frac{\cos \frac{A}{2}}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{3} \implies \cos \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{3} \sin \frac{A}{2}
\]

We also know that \( \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} + \cos^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1 \). Substituting \( \cos \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{3} \sin \frac{A}{2} \) into this equation, we get:
\[
\sin^2 \frac{A}{2} + \left( \frac{\sqrt{39}}{3} \sin \frac{A}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} + \frac{39}{9} \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1 \implies \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} + \frac{13}{3} \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1 \implies \frac{16}{3} \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1 \implies \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \implies \sin \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

Then, \( \cos \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{117}}{12} = \frac{3\sqrt{13}}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{4} \).

The area \( \Delta \) of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) can be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A = \frac{1}{2} bc \cdot 2 \sin \frac{A}{2} \cos \frac{A}{2} = bc \sin \frac{A}{2} \cos \frac{A}{2} = bc \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{13}}{4} = bc \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{16}
\]

The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed using the circumradius \( R \) and the sides \( a, b, c \):
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} = \frac{abc}{52}
\]

Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
bc \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{16} = \frac{abc}{52} \implies bc \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{16} = \frac{bc \cdot a}{52} \implies \frac{\sqrt{39}}{16} = \frac{a}{52} \implies a = 52 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{16} = \frac{13\sqrt{39}}{4}
\]

The product \( AB \cdot AC = bc \) can be found using the formula for the area again:
\[
\Delta = bc \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{16} = \frac{abc}{52} = \frac{\left( \frac{13\sqrt{39}}{4} \right) bc}{52} = \frac{13\sqrt{39} bc}{4 \cdot 52} = \frac{\sqrt{39} bc}{16}
\]
Since \( \Delta = bc \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{16} \), we have:
\[
bc = bc
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc \) is:

"To find the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.
\]

We will now consider the possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). First, let's check if any of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) can be zero. If \(a = 0\), then the equation simplifies to:

\[
bc = 100bc - 2,000,000 \implies 0 = 99bc - 2,000,000 \implies bc = \frac{2,000,000}{99}.
\]

Since \(\frac{2,000,000}{99}\) is not an integer, \(a\) cannot be zero. Similarly, \(b\) and \(c\) cannot be zero. Therefore, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must all be positive integers.

Next, we will check if \(a = b = c\). If \(a = b = c\), then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300 \implies a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6,000,000.
\]

Thus, \((a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100)\) is a solution. We need to check if there are any other solutions. Suppose \(a \neq b\). Without loss of generality, assume \(a \leq b < c\). Then \(a + b + c = 300\) implies \(c = 300 - a - b\). Substituting \(c = 300 - a - b\) into the second equation, we get:

\[
a^2b + a^2(300 - a - b) + b^2a + b^2(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)^2a + (300 - a - b)^2b = 6,000,000.
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:

\[
a^2b + 300a^2 - a^3 - a^2b + ab^2 + 300b^2 - ab^2 - b^3 + a(300 - a - b)^2 + b(300 - a - b)^2 = 6,000,000.
\]

The \(a^2b\) and \(ab^2\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
300a^2 - a^3 - b^3 + a(300 - a - b)^2 + b(300 - a - b)^2 = 6,000,000.
\]

Expanding \(a(300 - a - b)^2\) and \(b(300 - a - b)^2\), we get:

\[
a(90000 - 600a - 600b + a^2 + 2ab + b^2) + b(90000 - 600a - 600b + a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = 90000a - 600a^2 - 600ab + a^3 + 2a^2b + ab^2 + 90000b - 600ab - 600b^2 + a^2b + 2ab^2 + b^3.
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
90000a + 90000b - 600a^2 - 600b^2 - 1200ab + 2a^2b + 3ab^2 + a^3 + b^3 = 6,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + a^2b + b^2a + 3ab^2 + 2a^2b - 600a^2 - 600b^2 - 1200ab + 90000a + 90000b = 6,000,000.
\]

This equation is quite complex, and it is not easy to find any other solutions by inspection. However, we can use the fact that the only solution to the original equations is \((a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100)\). Therefore, the number of non-negative integer solutions is:

"Given points \(O = (0,0)\), \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B = \left(0,\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\), we need to find a point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not lie on any segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) of unit length segments with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis, except \(\overline{AB}\). The equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\) is given by:

\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Let \(C = (x, y)\) be a point on \(\overline{AB}\). Then, \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). For \(C\) to not lie on any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\), the distance from \(C\) to any point \(P = (a, 0)\) on the \(x\)-axis and any point \(Q = (0, b)\) on the \(y\)-axis must be greater than 1. The distance from \(C\) to \(P\) is:

\[
\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2}
\]

The distance from \(C\) to \(Q\) is:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-b)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - b)^2}
\]

For \(C\) to not lie on any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\), both of these distances must be greater than 1. We will check the point \(C\) that divides \(\overline{AB}\) in the ratio \(1:2\). The coordinates of such a point are:

\[
C = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1 \cdot 0}{1+2}, \frac{2 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1+2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\right)
\]

We need to verify that the distance from \(C\) to any point \(P = (a, 0)\) on the \(x\)-axis and any point \(Q = (0, b)\) on the \(y\)-axis is greater than 1. First, we calculate the distance from \(C\) to \(P\):

\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{3} - a\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{3} - a\right)^2 + \frac{3}{36}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{3} - a\right)^2 + \frac{1}{12}}
\]

For this distance to be greater than 1, we need:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{3} - a\right)^2 + \frac{1}{12} > 1 \implies \left(\frac{1}{3} - a\right)^2 > \frac{11}{12}
\]

Since \(\left(\frac{1}{3} - a\right)^2\) is a square, it is always non-negative. The minimum value of \(\left(\frac{1}{3} - a\right)^2\) is 0, which occurs when \(a = \frac{1}{3}\). However, if \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), the distance is \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{12}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} < 1\), which is not greater than 1. Therefore, \(a\) must be either less than \(\frac{1}{3} - \sqrt{\frac{11}{12}}\) or greater than \(\frac{1}{3} + \sqrt{\frac{11}{12}}\). Since \(a\) is on the \(x\)-axis and \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{2}\), we need to check if \(\frac{1}{3} + \sqrt{\frac{11}{12}} > \frac{1}{2}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{11}{12}} = \sqrt{\frac{11 \cdot 3}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{33}}{6}
\]

We need to compare \(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{33}}{6}\) with \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{33}}{6} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{33}}{6}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{33} > 5\), we have:

\[
\frac{2 + \sqrt{33}}{6} > \frac{2 + 5}{6} = \frac{7}{6} > \frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore, \(a\) must be less than \(\frac{1}{3} - \sqrt{\frac{11}{12}}\), which is not possible since \(a\) is non-negative. Thus, the only point on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not lie on any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) is \(C = \left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\right)\).

Finally, we calculate \(OC^2\):

\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4}{36} + \frac{3}{36} = \frac{7}{36}

"Given that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000. First, we simplify the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.\]

Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\). We can rewrite it as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).\]
By substituting \(x = \omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\), we get \(P(\omega^k) = 0\), which means:
\[\omega^{13k} - 1 = 0 \implies 1 - \omega^{13k} = 0.\]

\[x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(x - \omega^k).\]
By substituting \(x = 2\) into the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\), we get:

We can use the fact that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). Therefore, we can rewrite the product as:

By using the properties of roots of unity, we can find that:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 13^6.\]

"To determine the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there exist more than ten \( b \)-elegant numbers, we start by expressing a \( b \)-elegant number \( n \) in the form \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) (i.e., \( 0 \le a, c < b \) and \( a \neq 0 \) since \( n \) is a two-digit number). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-elegant is that the sum of its digits \( a + c \) equals \( \sqrt{n} \). Therefore, we have:

\[
a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}
\]

Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:

\[
(a + c)^2 = ab + c
\]

Expanding and rearranging terms, we obtain:

\[
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \implies a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \implies a^2 + c(2a - 1) + c^2 - ab = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):

\[
c^2 + (2a - 1 - b)c + a^2 = 0

For \( c \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant \( \Delta \) is given by:

\[
\Delta = (2a - 1 - b)^2 - 4a^2 = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4ab + b^2 - b^2 - 4a^2 = 1 - 4a - 4ab
\]

Thus, we need:

\[
1 - 4a(1 + b) = k^2
\]

for some integer \( k \). Rearranging, we get:

\[
4a(1 + b) = 1 - k^2 \implies 4a(1 + b) = (1 - k)(1 + k)
\]

Since \( 4a(1 + b) \) is always even, \( (1 - k)(1 + k) \) must also be even. This means that \( k \) must be odd. Let \( k = 2m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \). Then:

\[
4a(1 + b) = (1 - (2m + 1))(1 + (2m + 1)) = -4m(m + 1) \implies a(1 + b) = -m(m + 1)
\]

Since \( a \) and \( 1 + b \) are positive integers, \( m(m + 1) \) must be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, we need to consider the case where \( k = -2m - 1 \):

\[
4a(1 + b) = (1 + (2m + 1))(1 - (2m + 1)) = 4m(m + 1) \implies a(1 + b) = m(m + 1)

Now, we need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than ten pairs of integers \( (a, m) \) satisfying \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( a(1 + b) = m(m + 1) \). We will check values of \( b \) starting from 2:

1. For \( b = 2 \):

8. For \( b = 9 \):

   a(1 + 9) = m(m + 1) \implies 10a = m(m + 1)

   The possible values of \( m \) are 2, 4, 5, and 9. This gives us \( a = 2 \), \( a = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( a = 9 \), so there are 4 \( b \)-elegant numbers: 20, 40, 50, and 90.

   The possible values of \( m \) are 5 and 10. This gives us \( a = 5 \) and \( a = 10 \), so there are 2 \( b \)-elegant numbers: 55 and 110.

10. For \( b = 11 \):
    \[
    a(1 + 11) = m(m + 1) \implies 12a = m(m + 1)

    The possible values of \( m \) are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 11. This gives us \( a = 1 \), \( a = 2 \), \( a = 3 \), \( a = 6 \), and \( a = 11 \), so there are 5 \( b \)-elegant numbers: 12, 24, 36, 72, and 132.

11. For \( b = 12 \):
    \[
    a(1 + 12) = m(m + 1) \implies 13a = m(m + 1)

    The possible values of \( m \) are 3 and 12. This gives us \( a = 3 \) and \( a = 12 \), so there are 2 \( b \)-elegant numbers: 39 and 156.

    a(1 + 13) = m(m + 1) \implies 14a = m(m + 1)

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed within a fixed regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon), where each side of the rectangle lies on or along a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the possible choices for the horizontal and vertical sides of the rectangle.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{12} \) in clockwise order. The horizontal sides of the rectangle can be chosen by selecting two horizontal lines from the set of horizontal lines formed by the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. Similarly, the vertical sides of the rectangle can be chosen by selecting two vertical lines from the set of vertical lines formed by the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon.

### Step 1: Count the horizontal lines
The horizontal lines are formed by the sides of the dodecagon and the diagonals that are parallel to the sides. There are 6 such lines:
- \( A_1A_2, A_4A_5, A_7A_8, A_{10}A_{11} \) (sides of the dodecagon)
- \( A_3A_6, A_9A_{12} \) (diagonals parallel to the sides)

Thus, there are 6 horizontal lines.

### Step 2: Count the vertical lines
The vertical lines are formed by the sides of the dodecagon and the diagonals that are perpendicular to the sides. There are also 6 such lines:
- \( A_2A_3, A_5A_6, A_8A_9, A_{11}A_{12} \) (sides of the dodecagon)
- \( A_1A_4, A_4A_7, A_7A_{10}, A_{10}A_1 \) (diagonals perpendicular to the sides)

Thus, there are 6 vertical lines.

### Step 3: Determine the number of rectangles
To form a rectangle, we need to choose 2 horizontal lines out of the 6 available and 2 vertical lines out of the 6 available. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 6 is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{6}{2} \).

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Since we need to choose 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines, the total number of rectangles is:

\[
15 \times 15 = 225
\]

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed within the fixed regular dodecagon is \(\boxed{225}\).","[225, '225']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"Given the properties of the list of positive integers, we need to find the sum of the squares of all elements in the list. Let's denote the list as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).

1. **Sum of elements**: \(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 30\).
2. **Uniqueness of mode**: The mode is 9, which means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list.
3. **Medians**: The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Since the mode is 9, let's assume that 9 appears \(k\) times in the list. The median is the middle number when the list is sorted. If \(n\) is odd, the median is the \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\)-th element. If \(n\) is even, the median is the average of the \(\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\)-th and \(\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)\)-th elements. Since the median does not appear in the list, \(n\) must be odd (if \(n\) were even, the median would be the average of two elements, at least one of which must appear in the list).

Let's consider the smallest possible value for \(n\), which is 5. If \(n = 5\), the median is the third element. Since the median does not appear in the list, the third element must be a number other than 9. Let's assume the list is \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\) in non-decreasing order. Then \(a_3\) is the median, and \(a_3 \neq 9\).

If 9 appears \(k\) times, and \(k \geq 3\) (since 9 is the mode), then \(k = 3\) (if \(k = 4\) or more, the sum would be at least \(9 \times 4 + 1 + 1 = 37\), which is greater than 30). Therefore, the list must be \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9\) with \(a_1 \leq a_2 < 9\). The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 = a_1 + a_2 + 27 = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 = 3\). The only possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are 1 and 2 (since they are positive integers and \(a_1 \leq a_2\)). Therefore, the list is \(1, 2, 9, 9, 9\).

Now, we calculate the sum of the squares of the elements:
\[1^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 248.\]

Thus, the sum of the squares of all elements in the list is \(\boxed{248}\).","[248, '248']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading from left to right in each row equals 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading from top to bottom equals 99.

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Sum of the numbers in each row
The number formed by reading the first row from left to right is \(100a + 10b + c\).
The number formed by reading the second row from left to right is \(100d + 10e + f\).

According to the problem, their sum is:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]

### Step 2: Sum of the numbers in each column
The number formed by reading the first column from top to bottom is \(10a + d\).
The number formed by reading the second column from top to bottom is \(10b + e\).
The number formed by reading the third column from top to bottom is \(10c + f\).

According to the problem, their sum is:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equations
First, simplify the row sum equation:
\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
\]

Next, simplify the column sum equation:
\[
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
\]

### Step 4: Subtract the column sum equation from the row sum equation
Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
90a + 99d + 9c = 900
\]

Divide through by 9:
\[
10a + 11d + c = 100
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the equation \(10a + 11d + c = 100\)
Since \(a\), \(d\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., \(0 \leq a, d, c \leq 9\)), we need to find integer solutions to this equation.

### Step 6: Find possible values for \(d\)
Since \(11d\) must be a multiple of 11 and \(10a + c\) must be a multiple of 11, \(d\) must be such that \(11d \leq 100\). The possible values for \(d\) are:
\[
d = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\]

However, \(11d\) must also be such that \(10a + c\) is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 100. We check each value of \(d\):

- If \(d = 0\), then \(10a + c = 100\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((10, 0)\), but \(a\) must be a digit (0-9), so no solutions.
- If \(d = 1\), then \(10a + c = 89\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((8, 9)\).
- If \(d = 2\), then \(10a + c = 78\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((7, 8)\).
- If \(d = 3\), then \(10a + c = 67\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((6, 7)\).
- If \(d = 4\), then \(10a + c = 56\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((5, 6)\).
- If \(d = 5\), then \(10a + c = 45\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((4, 5)\).
- If \(d = 6\), then \(10a + c = 34\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((3, 4)\).
- If \(d = 7\), then \(10a + c = 23\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((2, 3)\).
- If \(d = 8\), then \(10a + c = 12\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((1, 2)\).
- If \(d = 9\), then \(10a + c = 1\). Possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((0, 1)\).

There are 9 valid pairs \((a, c)\) for each \(d\).

### Step 7: Determine the number of valid configurations for each pair
For each valid pair \((a, c)\), we need to find \(b\) and \(e\) such that:
\[
10b + e + 10c + f = 99
\]

Given \(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\), we already have \(10a + d + 10c + f = 100\). Therefore:
\[
10b + e = 99 - (10a + d + 10c + f) = 99 - 100 = -1
\]

This equation is not possible since \(10b + e\) cannot be negative. Therefore, there are no valid configurations for each pair.

### Conclusion:
 there are no valid configurations for the given problem. Therefore, the number of ways to fill the grid is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"Given the system of equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4},
\]
we start by expressing each equation in terms of logarithms:
\[
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2 y - \log_2 x - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2 z - \log_2 x - \log_2 y = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Let's denote \(\log_2 x = a\), \(\log_2 y = b\), and \(\log_2 z = c\). The system of equations becomes:
\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}, \quad b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}, \quad c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
We can add all three equations together:
\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
To add the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 12:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}.
\]
So,
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}.
\]
We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\). Using the properties of logarithms, we have:
\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z = 4a + 3b + 2c.
\]
We can express \(4a + 3b + 2c\) in terms of \(a + b + c\):
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 2(a + b + c) + (a + b + c) = 3(a + b + c).
\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\), we get:
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 3\left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) = -\frac{39}{12} = -\frac{13}{4}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \left|-\frac{13}{4}\right| = \frac{13}{4}.
\]
The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 13 and 4, respectively. Thus, \(m + n = 13 + 4 = 17\). The final answer is:

"Given a convex regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, we need to find the length of its sides given that the triangle formed by the extensions of segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) has side lengths 200, 240, and 300.

First, let's denote the length of each side of the hexagon by \(s\). Since the hexagon is regular and all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, we can use the properties of parallel lines and similar triangles to solve the problem.

Consider the triangle formed by the extensions of \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\). Let's call this triangle \(PQR\), where \(P\) is the intersection of the extensions of \(AB\) and \(CD\), \(Q\) is the intersection of the extensions of \(CD\) and \(EF\), and \(R\) is the intersection of the extensions of \(EF\) and \(AB\).

Since \(AB \parallel CD \parallel EF\), the triangle \(PQR\) is similar to the triangle formed by the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon. The midpoints of the sides of the hexagon form an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the distance between the parallel sides of the hexagon.

Let's denote the distance between the parallel sides \(AB\) and \(CD\) by \(d_1\), the distance between the parallel sides \(CD\) and \(EF\) by \(d_2\), and the distance between the parallel sides \(EF\) and \(AB\) by \(d_3\). Since the hexagon is regular, \(d_1 = d_2 = d_3\).

The side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon is \(s\sqrt{3}\). The triangle \(PQR\) is similar to this equilateral triangle, and the ratio of the corresponding sides is the same as the ratio of the distances from the midpoints to the vertices of the hexagon.

The distance from the midpoint of a side to a vertex of the hexagon is \(s\sqrt{3}/2\). Therefore, the ratio of the side length of triangle \(PQR\) to the side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the midpoints is:
\[
\frac{d_1 + s\sqrt{3}}{s\sqrt{3}} = \frac{d_1}{s\sqrt{3}} + 1
\]

Since \(d_1 = s\sqrt{3}\), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{s\sqrt{3} + s\sqrt{3}}{s\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2s\sqrt{3}}{s\sqrt{3}} = 2
\]

This means that the side length of triangle \(PQR\) is twice the side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the midpoints. Therefore, the side length of triangle \(PQR\) is:
\[
2s\sqrt{3}
\]

Given that the side lengths of triangle \(PQR\) are 200, 240, and 300, we can see that the triangle is not equilateral. However, we can use the fact that the triangle is similar to the equilateral triangle formed by the midpoints to find the side length of the hexagon.

Since the triangle \(PQR\) is similar to the equilateral triangle formed by the midpoints, the side length of the hexagon is:
\[
s = \frac{200}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{100\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

Therefore, the length of each side of the hexagon is:

"Given a set \( A \) of positive integers, Bob forms all finite non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). The total number of such subsets is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements of set \( A \).

Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the subsets \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as their maximum element can be formed by choosing any subset of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1\} \) and adding \( a_i \) to it. The number of subsets of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1\} \) is \( 2^{a_i-1} \). Therefore, the number of subsets \( B \) with maximum element \( a_i \) is \( 2^{a_i-1} \).

The total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets with maximum element \( a_i \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n \). This gives us the equation:
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

We need to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. First, we find the binary representation of 2024:
\[
2024_{10} = 11111100010_2
\]
This binary representation tells us that:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^1
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
2^{a_1-1} = 2^1, \quad 2^{a_2-1} = 2^5, \quad 2^{a_3-1} = 2^6, \quad 2^{a_4-1} = 2^7, \quad 2^{a_5-1} = 2^8, \quad 2^{a_6-1} = 2^9, \quad 2^{a_7-1} = 2^{10}
\]

Solving for \( a_i \), we get:
\[
a_1 = 2, \quad a_2 = 6, \quad a_3 = 7, \quad a_4 = 8, \quad a_5 = 9, \quad a_6 = 10, \quad a_7 = 11

The sum of the elements of set \( A \) is:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 2 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11

Calculating the sum, we get:

\[
8 + 7 = 15

\[

"Given a four-digit number \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), we need to find the largest \( N \) such that when any of its digits is changed by \( \pm 1 \), the resulting number is divisible by 7. This means that for each digit \( x \) of \( N \), the numbers \( N + 10^k \) and \( N - 10^k \) (where \( k \) is the position of \( x \)) must be divisible by 7. This can be expressed as:
\[ N \equiv -10^k \pmod{7} \quad \text{and} \quad N \equiv 10^k \pmod{7} \]
for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \). Since \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we have:
\[ 10^0 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}, \quad 10^1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}, \quad 10^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}, \quad 10^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
Thus, the congruences become:
\[ N \equiv -1 \pmod{7}, \quad N \equiv -3 \pmod{7}, \quad N \equiv -2 \pmod{7}, \quad N \equiv -6 \pmod{7} \]
or equivalently:
\[ N \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad N \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad N \equiv 5 \pmod{7}, \quad N \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( N \) must satisfy all these congruences simultaneously, we need to find a common solution. However, since these congruences are not consistent with each other, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Instead, we should consider the possibility that the digits of \( N \) must be such that the sum of the changes in the digits when any one is changed by \( \pm 1 \) results in a number divisible by 7. This means that the sum of the digits of \( N \) must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let's check the largest four-digit number, 9999, and work our way down until we find a number that satisfies the condition. The sum of the digits of 9999 is \( 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 \), which is not divisible by 7. The next number is 9998, and the sum of its digits is \( 9 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 35 \), which is divisible by 7. Therefore, 9998 is a candidate.

We need to verify that changing any digit of 9998 by \( \pm 1 \) results in a number divisible by 7:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles where the torus \( T \) touches the sphere \( S \) from the inside and the outside, respectively. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere has a radius of 11.

First, let's consider the torus from the perspective of its major and minor radii. The major radius \( R \) of the torus is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube, which is 6 units. The minor radius \( r \) of the torus is the radius of the tube, which is 3 units.

When the torus is placed on the outside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 + r_i \). This distance is also equal to the sum of the major radius of the torus and the radius of the circle where the torus touches the sphere, which is \( 6 + r_i \). Therefore, we have:
\[
11 + r_i = 6 + r_i + 3
\]
This equation is not directly useful, so we need to consider the geometry of the situation in more detail.

The correct approach is to consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, which is 11 units minus the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the circle where the torus touches the sphere. This distance is also equal to the major radius of the torus minus the radius of the circle where the torus touches the sphere. Therefore, we have:
\[
11 - r_i = 6 - r_i + 3
\]
This equation is not directly useful either, so we need to consider the geometry of the situation in more detail.

The correct approach is to consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, which is 11 units minus the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the circle where the torus touches the sphere. This distance is also equal to the major radius of the torus minus the radius of the circle where the torus touches the sphere. Therefore, we have:
\[
11 - r_i = 6 + r_i
\]
Solving for \( r_i \), we get:
\[
11 - 6 = r_i + r_i \implies 5 = 2r_i \implies r_i = \frac{5}{2}
\]

Next, let's consider the torus from the perspective of its major and minor radii. When the torus is placed on the inside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 - r_o \). This distance is also equal to the major radius of the torus minus the radius of the circle where the torus touches the sphere, which is \( 6 - r_o \). Therefore, we have:
\[
11 - r_o = 6 - r_o + 3
\]
Solving for \( r_o \), we get:
\[
11 - 6 = r_o - r_o \implies 5 = 2r_o \implies r_o = \frac{17}{2}
\]

The difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = \frac{17}{2} - \frac{5}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

Therefore, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) can be written as \( \frac{6}{1} \), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). The sum \( m + n \) is:
\[
m + n = 6 + 1 = 7
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to consider the constraints given:

1. Each cell of the \(5 \times 5\) grid can contain at most one fish.
2. All fish in one row and all fish in one column must have the same color.
3. Any additional fish placed on the grid will break one or more of the previous two conditions.

Given these constraints, the only possible configurations are those where all fish in the grid are of the same color. This is because if we place fish of different colors, it will violate the second condition (all fish in one row and all fish in one column must have the same color).

There are two possible configurations:
1. All fish are white.
2. All fish are black.

In each configuration, there is only one way to place the fish because each cell must contain exactly one fish, and all fish must be of the same color.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the fish is:

2
