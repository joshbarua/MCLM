"To determine how many minutes Aya takes to walk to the coffee shop when she walks \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour, we start by analyzing the given information.

First, we know that when Aya walks \( s \) kilometers per hour, she takes 4 hours to walk 9 kilometers. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
4s = 9
\]
Solving for \( s \), we get:
\[
s = \frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \text{ kilometers per hour}
\]

Next, we know that when Aya walks \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, she takes 2 hours and 24 minutes to walk 9 kilometers. Converting 2 hours and 24 minutes to hours, we get:
\[
2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 \text{ hours}
\]
So, we can write the equation:
\[
2.4(s + 2) = 9
\]
Substituting \( s = 2.25 \) into the equation, we verify:
\[
2.4(2.25 + 2) = 2.4 \times 4.25 = 10.2 \neq 9
\]
This indicates a need to recheck the logical approach. Instead, we use the correct approach to find \( t \) directly.

We use the relationship between speed, distance, and time. When Aya walks \( s \) km/h, she takes 4 hours to walk 9 km, so the time taken is:
\[
\frac{9}{s} = 4 + \frac{t}{60}
\]
When Aya walks \( s + 2 \) km/h, she takes 2 hours and 24 minutes to walk 9 km, so the time taken is:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 + \frac{t}{60}
\]
We now have two equations:
1. \(\frac{9}{s} = 4 + \frac{t}{60}\)
2. \(\frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 + \frac{t}{60}\)

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = (4 + \frac{t}{60}) - (2.4 + \frac{t}{60})
\]
Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
Finding a common denominator for the left side, we get:
\[
\frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
Simplifying the numerator, we get:
\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
Multiplying both sides by \( s(s+2) \), we get:
\[
18 = 1.6s(s+2)
\]
Dividing both sides by 1.6, we get:
\[
11.25 = s(s+2)
\]
This is a quadratic equation:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

Now, we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} = 4 + \frac{t}{60}
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
3.6 = 4 + \frac{t}{60}
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[
-0.4 = \frac{t}{60}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 60, we get:
\[
t = -0.4 \times 60 = -24
\]

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given problem, we start by noting that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). This means that \(DB = DC\) and \(D\) is the excenter of \(\triangle ABC\) opposite to \(A\). The point \(P\) is the second intersection of the line \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\).

By the Power of a Point theorem, we know that for point \(D\) outside the circle, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is equal to \(DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP\). Since \(DB = DC\), we can use the fact that \(D\) is the excenter to find the lengths of the tangents from \(D\) to the points of tangency.

The length of the tangent from a point outside a circle to the point of tangency is given by the formula:
\[ DB = DC = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC - BC^2 / 4} \]

Substituting the given side lengths \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we get:
\[ DB = DC = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10 - \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{50 - \frac{81}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{200}{4} - \frac{81}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{119}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{119}}{2} \]

Now, using the Power of a Point theorem at point \(D\), we have:
\[ DB^2 = DA \cdot DP \]
\[ \left(\frac{\sqrt{119}}{2}\right)^2 = DA \cdot DP \]
\[ \frac{119}{4} = DA \cdot DP \]

Since \(P\) is the second intersection of \(AD\) with the circumcircle, \(AP \cdot PD = DB^2\). Let \(AP = x\) and \(PD = y\). Then \(AD = x + y\) and we have:
\[ x \cdot y = \frac{119}{4} \]
\[ (x + y) \cdot y = \frac{119}{4} \]

We also know from the properties of the excenter and the circumcircle that \(AP\) is given by the formula:
\[ AP = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{AB + AC - BC} \]
Substituting the given side lengths, we get:
\[ AP = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{5 + 10 - 9} = \frac{50}{6} = \frac{25}{3} \]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{25}{3}\). The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 25 and 3, respectively, and their sum is:
\[ m + n = 25 + 3 = 28 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the probability that an octagon can be rotated such that all its vertices map onto the positions of the original vertices, we need to consider the symmetries of the octagon. A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries: the identity rotation (0 degrees), and rotations by 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees.

We are interested in the probability that a random rotation of the octagon will result in each vertex mapping to one of the original vertex positions. This means that the rotation must be one of the 8 symmetries of the octagon. Since there are 360 possible degrees of rotation (from 0 to 359), the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:

\[
\frac{8}{360} = \frac{1}{45}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1}{45}\) is already in its simplest form, so \(m = 1\) and \(n = 45\). The sum \(m + n\) is:

\[
m + n = 1 + 45 = 46
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{46}

"To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \]
\[ g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \]

The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into cases:
- If \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( |x| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).

Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into cases:
- If \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( |x| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).

Now, let's consider the composition \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( |f(\sin(2\pi x))| \) will range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

This means that \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(1\).

Next, let's consider the composition \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( |f(\cos(3\pi y))| \) will range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

This means that \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(1\).

Since both \( x \) and \( y \) range from \(0\) to \(1\), we need to find the points \((x, y)\) that satisfy both equations:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]

To find these points, we can analyze the behavior of the functions. Notice that both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are periodic and symmetric. The function \( f(x) \) has a period of 1 and is symmetric around \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{1}{2} \). Similarly, \( g(x) \) has a period of 1 and is symmetric around \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{1}{4} \).

By symmetry and periodicity, we can see that the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) will intersect at points where \( x = y \) and \( x = 1 - y \). This gives us the points \((0, 0)\), \((1, 1)\), \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\), and \(\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{4}\right)\).

Therefore, the number of intersections is:

"Given that \( p \) is a prime number such that \( p \mid n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \), we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( p^2 \mid m^4 + 1 \).

First, let's analyze the condition \( p \mid n^4 + 1 \). This implies that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \). We need to find \( m \) such that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

By Euler's theorem, since \( p \) is a prime, \( n^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \). Therefore, \( n^{4(p-1)} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \). This means that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) must divide \( 4(p-1) \). Since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \), the order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) must be 8 (because \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) and no smaller power of \( n \) is congruent to 1 modulo \( p \)).

Now, we need to find \( m \) such that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). By Hensel's lemma, if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \) and the derivative of \( f(x) = x^4 + 1 \) at \( x = n \) is not divisible by \( p \), then there exists an integer \( m \) such that \( m \equiv n \pmod{p} \) and \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

The derivative of \( f(x) = x^4 + 1 \) is \( f'(x) = 4x^3 \). Since \( p \) is a prime and \( p \nmid n \), \( f'(n) = 4n^3 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p} \). Therefore, by Hensel's lemma, there exists an integer \( m \) such that \( m \equiv n \pmod{p} \) and \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

The smallest positive integer \( m \) that satisfies this condition is \( m = n + kp \) for some integer \( k \). The smallest positive \( m \) is when \( k = 0 \), so \( m = n \).

However, we need to check if \( m = n \) is indeed the smallest positive integer such that \( p^2 \mid m^4 + 1 \). Since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \), we need to check if there is a smaller \( m \) than \( n \) that satisfies \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). By the properties of Hensel's lemma, the smallest \( m \) is indeed \( n \).

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( p^2 \mid m^4 + 1 \) is \( \boxed{p} \).","[p, 'p']",110,"[110, '110']",False
"To find the distance from the point \( I \) (the centroid of the tetrahedron) to each of its faces, we start by using the formula for the distance from a point to a plane in a tetrahedron. The distance \( d \) from a point \( I \) to a face \( \triangle ABC \) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A_{ABC}}
\]

where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( A_{ABC} \) is the area of the face \( \triangle ABC \).

First, we calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a = AB = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = AC = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = AD = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = BC = \sqrt{89} \), \( e = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( f = CD = \sqrt{41} \) is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths, we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
288 V^2 = -\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Next, we perform row operations to simplify the determinant. Subtract the first row from the other rows:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & -41 & 9 & -9 \\
0 & 45 & -80 & -48 \\
0 & 39 & -39 & -89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Now, expand along the first column:

\[
288 V^2 = -\left( 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 9 & -9 \\
45 & -80 & -48 \\
39 & -39 & -89
\end{vmatrix} \right)
\]

We need to compute the 3x3 determinant:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 9 & -9 \\
45 & -80 & -48 \\
39 & -39 & -89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Using cofactor expansion along the first row:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 9 & -9 \\
45 & -80 & -48 \\
39 & -39 & -89
\end{vmatrix} = -41 \begin{vmatrix}
-80 & -48 \\
-39 & -89
\end{vmatrix} - 9 \begin{vmatrix}
45 & -48 \\
39 & -89
\end{vmatrix} - 9 \begin{vmatrix}
45 & -80 \\
39 & -39
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculate each 2x2 determinant:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-80 & -48 \\
-39 & -89
\end{vmatrix} = (-80)(-89) - (-48)(-39) = 7120 - 1872 = 5248
\]

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
45 & -48 \\
39 & -89
\end{vmatrix} = (45)(-89) - (-48)(39) = -4005 + 1872 = -2133
\]

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
45 & -80 \\
39 & -39
\end{vmatrix} = (45)(-39) - (-80)(39) = -1755 + 3120 = 1365
\]

Substitute these values back into the 3x3 determinant:

\[
-41 \cdot 5248 - 9 \cdot (-2133) - 9 \cdot 1365 = -215168 + 19197 - 12285 = -208256
\]

Thus:

\[
288 V^2 = -(-208256) = 208256
\]

\[
V^2 = \frac{208256}{288} = \frac{26032}{36} = \frac{6508}{9}
\]

\[
V = \sqrt{\frac{6508}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{6508}}{3}
\]

Next, we find the area \( A_{ABC} \) of the face \( \triangle ABC \) using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

\[
s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

The area \( A_{ABC} \) is:

\[
A_{ABC} = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

\[
s - AB = \frac{\sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41}}{2}
\]

\[
s - AC = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{80}}{2}
\]

\[
s - BC = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} - \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

Using the known values of the edge lengths, we find:

\[
A_{ABC} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{80}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} - \sqrt{89}}{2} \right)}
\]

After simplification, we find:

\[
A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{16 \cdot 16 \cdot 16 \cdot 16} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 16 = 4
\]

Finally, the distance \( d \) from the centroid \( I \) to the face \( \triangle ABC \) is:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A_{ABC}} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6508}}{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{6508}}{4}
\]

Simplify \( \sqrt{6508} \):

\[
\sqrt{6508} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 1627} = 2\sqrt{1627}
\]

Thus:

\[
d = \frac{2\sqrt{1627}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{1627}}{2}
\]

The distance is in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 1 \), \( n = 1627 \), and \( p = 2 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 1 + 1627 + 2 = 1630 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1630}

"Given that each paraboloid has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the sphere that can be inscribed in each paraboloid. The surface area \( A \) of a paraboloid of revolution with radius \( r \) and height \( h \) is given by:

\[ A = \pi r \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} + \pi r^2 \]

The volume \( V \) of a paraboloid of revolution with radius \( r \) and height \( h \) is given by:

\[ V = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 h \]

We are given that \( A = 54 \) and \( V = 23 \). First, we substitute the given values into the volume equation:

\[ 23 = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 h \]
\[ 46 = \pi r^2 h \]
\[ h = \frac{46}{\pi r^2} \]

Next, we substitute \( h = \frac{46}{\pi r^2} \) into the surface area equation:

\[ 54 = \pi r \sqrt{r^2 + \left( \frac{46}{\pi r^2} \right)^2} + \pi r^2 \]
\[ 54 = \pi r \sqrt{r^2 + \frac{2116}{\pi^2 r^4}} + \pi r^2 \]
\[ 54 = \pi r \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2 r^6 + 2116}{\pi^2 r^4}} + \pi r^2 \]
\[ 54 = \pi r \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\pi^2 r^6 + 2116}}{\pi r^2} + \pi r^2 \]
\[ 54 = \frac{\sqrt{\pi^2 r^6 + 2116}}{r} + \pi r^2 \]
\[ 54r = \sqrt{\pi^2 r^6 + 2116} + \pi r^3 \]
\[ 54r - \pi r^3 = \sqrt{\pi^2 r^6 + 2116} \]

We square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[ (54r - \pi r^3)^2 = \pi^2 r^6 + 2116 \]
\[ 2916r^2 - 108\pi r^4 + \pi^2 r^6 = \pi^2 r^6 + 2116 \]
\[ 2916r^2 - 108\pi r^4 = 2116 \]
\[ 108\pi r^4 = 2916r^2 - 2116 \]
\[ 108\pi r^4 - 2916r^2 + 2116 = 0 \]

Let \( x = r^2 \). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in \( x \):

\[ 108\pi x^2 - 2916x + 2116 = 0 \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 108\pi \), \( b = -2916 \), and \( c = 2116 \):

\[ x = \frac{2916 \pm \sqrt{2916^2 - 4 \cdot 108\pi \cdot 2116}}{2 \cdot 108\pi} \]
\[ x = \frac{2916 \pm \sqrt{8503056 - 924672\pi}}{216\pi} \]

We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so we calculate \( 924672\pi \):

\[ 924672\pi \approx 924672 \cdot 3.14159 = 2908800 \]

Thus, the expression under the square root becomes:

\[ 8503056 - 2908800 = 5594256 \]

So the equation for \( x \) is:

\[ x = \frac{2916 \pm \sqrt{5594256}}{216\pi} \]
\[ x = \frac{2916 \pm 2366}{216\pi} \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = \frac{5282}{216\pi} = \frac{2641}{108\pi} \]
\[ x = \frac{550}{216\pi} = \frac{275}{108\pi} \]

Since \( x = r^2 \) and the radius \( r \) must be a real number, we need to check which solution is valid. By comparing the surface area and volume equations, we find that the correct solution is:

\[ r^2 = \frac{275}{108\pi} \]

Thus, \( p = 275 \) and \( q = 108 \), and the sum \( p + q \) is:

\[ p + q = 275 + 108 = 383 \]

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{383} \]","[383, '383']",721,"[721, '721']",False
"To solve the given equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each logarithmic expression.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, which states that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Again, using the power rule of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\):
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

We know that \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\) are reciprocals of each other, i.e., \(\log_x(y) \cdot \log_y(x) = 1\). Substituting the expressions we found, we get:
\[
\frac{10}{x} \cdot \frac{5}{2y} = 1
\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
\frac{50}{2xy} = 1
\]
This simplifies further to:
\[
\frac{25}{xy} = 1
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(xy\), we get:
\[
25 = xy
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) such that Bob can guarantee a win when the initial number of tokens is \( n \) and \( n \leq 2024 \), we need to analyze the game's dynamics. The key is to identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if any move from that position leads to a winning position, and a winning position is one from which there is at least one move to a losing position.

Let's define \( L \) as a losing position and \( W \) as a winning position. The base cases are:
- \( n = 0 \) is a losing position because there are no tokens left to move.
- \( n = 1 \) is a winning position because Bob can take the single token and win.
- \( n = 2 \) is a winning position because Bob can take 1 token and leave Alice with 1 token, which is a winning position for Bob.
- \( n = 3 \) is a winning position because Bob can take 1 token and leave Alice with 2 tokens, which is a winning position for Bob.
- \( n = 4 \) is a winning position because Bob can take all 4 tokens and win.
- \( n = 5 \) is a losing position because any move Bob makes will leave Alice with a winning position (either 1, 2, 3, or 4 tokens).

From \( n = 5 \), we can see a pattern. If \( n = 5k + r \) where \( r \) is the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 5 (i.e., \( r \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\} \)), then:
- If \( r = 0 \), \( n = 5k \) is a losing position because any move Bob makes will leave Alice with \( 5k-1, 5k-2, 5k-3, \) or \( 5k-4 \) tokens, all of which are winning positions.
- If \( r \neq 0 \), \( n = 5k + r \) is a winning position because Bob can take \( r \) tokens and leave Alice with \( 5k \) tokens, which is a losing position.

Therefore, the losing positions are the multiples of 5. We need to count the multiples of 5 that are less than or equal to 2024. The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is \( 5 \times 404 = 2020 \). The multiples of 5 form an arithmetic sequence: \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \). The number of terms in this sequence is given by:
\[
\frac{2020}{5} = 404
\]
Thus, there are 404 losing positions. Since there are 2024 positive integers from 1 to 2024, the number of winning positions is:
\[
2024 - 404 = 1620
\]
Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) such that Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{1620}\).","[1620, '1620']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To determine the probability that Jen ay nanalo ng grand prize given that she ay nanalo ng premyo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10.**

   The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \frac{10!}{4! \cdot 6!}
   \]

   Simplifying the factorials:
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that exactly 2 of them are 2.**

   Since one of the numbers must be 2, we need to choose the remaining 3 numbers from the set \(\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has 9 elements. The number of ways to choose 3 numbers out of 9 is:
   \[
   \binom{9}{3} = \frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \frac{9!}{3! \cdot 6!}
   \]

   Simplifying the factorials:
   \[
   \binom{9}{3} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that all 4 of them are 2.**

   There is only one way to choose all 4 numbers as 2, which is:
   \[
   \binom{1}{4} = 0
   \]

   However, this is not possible since we are choosing from 10 numbers and we need to choose 4 numbers.

4. **Calculate the probability of nanalo the premyo.**

   The probability of nanalo the premyo is the number of ways to choose exactly 2 numbers as 2 divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10:
   \[
   P(\text{premyo}) = \frac{\binom{9}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{84}{210} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

5. **Calculate the probability of nanalo the grand prize given that she ay nanalo the premyo.**

   The probability of nanalo the grand prize given that she ay nanalo the premyo is the number of ways to choose all 4 numbers as 2 divided by the number of ways to choose exactly 2 numbers as 2:
   \[
   P(\text{grand prize} \mid \text{premyo}) = \frac{\binom{1}{4}}{\binom{9}{3}} = \frac{0}{84} = 0

"Given that \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are squares, and \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can deduce that \(CE\) is the sum of the side lengths of the two squares. Let's denote the side length of square \(ABCD\) as \(s_1\) and the side length of square \(EFGH\) as \(s_2\). From the problem, we know that \(s_1 = AB = 107\) and \(s_2 = EF = 184\).

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the distance \(CE\) is the sum of the side lengths of the two squares:
\[
CE = s_1 + s_2 = 107 + 184 = 291

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of landas on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that are exactly 4 units away from the center landa in any of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

First, let's identify the coordinates of the center landa. Since the grid is \(8 \times 8\), the center landa is at position \((4, 4)\).

Next, we need to find the landas that are exactly 4 units away from \((4, 4)\) in each of the four cardinal directions:

1. **North**: Moving north from \((4, 4)\) by 4 units, we get the position \((4, 4+4) = (4, 8)\).
2. **South**: Moving south from \((4, 4)\) by 4 units, we get the position \((4, 4-4) = (4, 0)\).
3. **East**: Moving east from \((4, 4)\) by 4 units, we get the position \((4+4, 4) = (8, 4)\).
4. **West**: Moving west from \((4, 4)\) by 4 units, we get the position \((4-4, 4) = (0, 4)\).

Now, we check if each of these positions is within the bounds of the \(8 \times 8\) grid:
- \((4, 8)\) is within the grid.
- \((4, 0)\) is within the grid.
- \((8, 4)\) is within the grid.
- \((0, 4)\) is within the grid.

Since all four positions are within the grid, there are 4 landas that are exactly 4 units away from the center landa in any of the four cardinal directions.

Thus, the number of landas that satisfy the given condition is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",294,"[294, '294']",True
"Given the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the maximum possible value of the magnitude of this expression.

First, let's express \(z\) in polar form. Since \(|z| = 4\), we can write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) for some real number \(\theta\). Then, the reciprocal of \(z\) is \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + 24(1+3i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these in, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 24(1+3i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24(\cos\theta - i\cos\theta + 3i\sin\theta + 3\sin\theta).
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + (75+117)i\cos\theta) + 24(\cos\theta + 3\sin\theta + (-1+3)i\cos\theta).
\]

Distributing the constants, we get:
\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 4(75+117)i\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta + 72\sin\theta + 24(-1+3)i\cos\theta.
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta) + (-468\sin\theta + 72\sin\theta) + (4(75+117) + 24(-1+3))i\cos\theta.
\]

Simplifying further, we get:
\[
324\cos\theta - 396\sin\theta + (4 \cdot 192 + 24 \cdot 2)i\cos\theta = 324\cos\theta - 396\sin\theta + (768 + 48)i\cos\theta = 324\cos\theta - 396\sin\theta + 816i\cos\theta.
\]

The magnitude of this complex number is given by:
\[
\sqrt{(324\cos\theta - 396\sin\theta)^2 + (816\cos\theta)^2}.
\]

Expanding the squares, we get:
\[
\sqrt{324^2\cos^2\theta - 2 \cdot 324 \cdot 396 \cdot \cos\theta \sin\theta + 396^2\sin^2\theta + 816^2\cos^2\theta}.
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sqrt{(324^2 + 816^2)\cos^2\theta - 2 \cdot 324 \cdot 396 \cdot \cos\theta \sin\theta + 396^2\sin^2\theta}.
\]

We can factor out the common terms:
\[
\sqrt{(324^2 + 816^2)(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) - 2 \cdot 324 \cdot 396 \cdot \cos\theta \sin\theta}.
\]

Since \(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1\), we have:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 816^2 - 2 \cdot 324 \cdot 396 \cdot \cos\theta \sin\theta}.
\]

The maximum value of the magnitude occurs when the term \(-2 \cdot 324 \cdot 396 \cdot \cos\theta \sin\theta\) is minimized, which happens when \(\cos\theta \sin\theta = 0\). Therefore, the maximum value is:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 816^2}.
\]

Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
324^2 = 104976 \quad \text{and} \quad 816^2 = 665856.
\]

Adding these together, we get:
\[
104976 + 665856 = 770832.

Taking the square root, we get:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information about the circles and the triangle. We know that there are 2024 circles each with a radius of 1, arranged in a pattern such that each circle is tangent to two other circles and to two sides of the triangle \(ABC\). This arrangement implies that the circles form a chain along the sides of the triangle.

First, let's determine the total length of the sides of the triangle \(ABC\) that are covered by the circles. Since each circle has a radius of 1, the length of the side of the triangle that each circle touches is equal to its diameter, which is 2. Therefore, the total length covered by the 2024 circles is:
\[
2024 \times 2 = 4048
\]
This total length is equal to the perimeter of the triangle \(ABC\), so we have:
\[
AB + BC + CA = 4048
\]

Next, we need to find the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\). The formula for the area \(A\) of a triangle in terms of its inradius and its semiperimeter \(s\) is:
\[
A = r \cdot s
\]
where the semiperimeter \(s\) is half of the perimeter:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \frac{4048}{2} = 2024
\]

To find the area \(A\) of triangle \(ABC\), we can use the fact that the circles are arranged in a way that they form a chain along the sides of the triangle. The area of the triangle can also be expressed in terms of the area of the smaller triangles formed by the centers of the circles and the points where they touch the sides of the triangle.

Consider the smaller triangles formed by the centers of the circles and the points where they touch the sides of the triangle. Each of these smaller triangles has a height equal to the radius of the circles, which is 1. The base of each smaller triangle is equal to the length of the side of the triangle minus the lengths of the segments of the side that are not covered by the circles. Since each circle is tangent to two other circles and to two sides of the triangle, the length of the segments of each side that are not covered by the circles is equal to the sum of the diameters of the circles that are tangent to that side. Therefore, the base of each smaller triangle is:
\[
AB - 2 \times 1 = AB - 2, \quad BC - 2 \times 1 = BC - 2, \quad CA - 2 \times 1 = CA - 2
\]

The area of each smaller triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (AB - 2) \times 1 = \frac{AB - 2}{2}, \quad \frac{BC - 2}{2}, \quad \frac{CA - 2}{2}
\]

The total area of all the smaller triangles is:
\[
\text{Total area of smaller triangles} = \frac{AB - 2}{2} + \frac{BC - 2}{2} + \frac{CA - 2}{2} = \frac{(AB - 2) + (BC - 2) + (CA - 2)}{2} = \frac{AB + BC + CA - 6}{2} = \frac{4048 - 6}{2} = \frac{4042}{2} = 2021
\]

Since the total area of the smaller triangles is equal to the area of triangle \(ABC\), we have:
\[
A = 2021
\]

Now, we can find the inradius \(r\) using the formula \(A = r \cdot s\):
\[
2021 = r \cdot 2024
\]
Solving for \(r\), we get:
\[
r = \frac{2021}{2024}
\]

The inradius \(r\) is given as \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Here, \(m = 2021\) and \(n = 2024\). Therefore, \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 2021 + 2024 = 4045

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the minimum value of \(BD^2\) for a rhombus \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the coordinates of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be expressed as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\) respectively. The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2y_1\), so \(BD^2 = 4y_1^2\).

Since \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1.
\]
Rearranging this equation to solve for \(x_1^2\), we get:
\[
x_1^2 = 20 \left(1 + \frac{y_1^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{5y_1^2}{6}.
\]
We need to minimize \(BD^2 = 4y_1^2\). To do this, we express \(x_1^2\) in terms of \(y_1^2\) and substitute it back into the equation of the hyperbola to ensure it is valid. However, since \(x_1^2\) must be non-negative, we have:
\[
20 + \frac{5y_1^2}{6} \geq 0,
\]
which is always true for all real \(y_1\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(y_1^2\) is 0, but this would make \(x_1 = 0\), which is not possible since it would not form a rhombus. Instead, we need to find the minimum positive value of \(y_1^2\) that satisfies the hyperbola equation.

The minimum positive value of \(y_1^2\) occurs when \(x_1^2\) is just greater than 20. As \(y_1^2\) increases, \(x_1^2\) increases without bound. However, the minimum value of \(y_1^2\) that satisfies the hyperbola equation and forms a rhombus is when \(x_1^2\) is just greater than 20. The minimum value of \(y_1^2\) that satisfies the hyperbola equation and forms a rhombus is when \(x_1^2\) is just greater than 20. The minimum value of \(y_1^2\) that satisfies the hyperbola equation and forms a rhombus is when \(x_1^2\) is just greater than 20.

Therefore, the minimum value of \(BD^2\) is:

"To determine the number of residents in Aimeville who may-ari angular all four types of bagays, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's define the following sets:

- \( A \): the set of residents who may-ari angular bagays.
- \( B \): the set of residents who may-ari angular golf clubs.
- \( C \): the set of residents who may-ari angular golf clubs.
- \( D \): the set of residents who may-ari angular hardin.

We are given the following information:
- \( |A| = 900 \)
- \( |B| = 195 \)
- \( |C| = 367 \)
- \( |D| = 562 \)
- \( |A \cap B| = 437 \)
- \( |A \cap C| = 234 \)
- \( |A \cap D| = 234 \)
- \( |B \cap C| = 234 \)
- \( |B \cap D| = 234 \)
- \( |C \cap D| = 234 \)
- \( |A \cap B \cap C| = 234 \)
- \( |A \cap B \cap D| = 234 \)
- \( |A \cap C \cap D| = 234 \)
- \( |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 \)
- \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = x \) (the number we need to find)

According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, the number of elements in the union of the sets \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) is given by:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

We know that the total number of residents in Aimeville is 900, so:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900
\]

Substituting the given values into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get:

\[
900 = 900 + 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 - 234 - 234 - 234 - 234 - 234 + 234 + 234 + 234 + 234 - x

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
900 = 900 + 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 - 6 \times 234 + 4 \times 234 - x

\[
900 = 900 + 195 + 367 + 562 - 437 - 1404 + 936 - x

Combining like terms:

\[
900 = 900 + (195 + 367 + 562 + 936) - (437 + 1404) - x

\[
900 = 900 + 2060 - 1841 - x

"Given that \(\triangle ABC\) has a circumcenter \(O\) and an incenter \(I\) such that \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the circumradius \(R = 13\), and the inradius \(r = 6\), we need to find the value of \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall that the distance \(OI\) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \(OI = \sqrt{13}\).

Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), we can use the fact that in a triangle where the angle between the line segment from a vertex to the incenter and the line segment from the circumcenter to the incenter is a right angle, the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle at \(A\). This is a well-known geometric property.

In a right triangle, the circumradius \(R\) is half the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, the hypotenuse \(BC\) is:
\[
BC = 2R = 2 \cdot 13 = 26
\]

In a right triangle, the inradius \(r\) is given by the formula:
\[
r = \frac{a + b - c}{2}
\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of the right triangle, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse. Substituting the known values \(r = 6\) and \(c = 26\), we get:
\[
6 = \frac{a + b - 26}{2}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain:
\[
12 = a + b - 26
\]
Adding 26 to both sides, we get:
\[
a + b = 38
\]

We need to find the product \(AB \cdot AC\), which is \(a \cdot b\). Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle, we have:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]
Substituting \(c = 26\), we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = 26^2 = 676
\]

We also know that:
\[
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab
\]
Substituting \(a + b = 38\) and \(a^2 + b^2 = 676\), we get:
\[
38^2 = 676 + 2ab
\]
Calculating \(38^2\), we have:
\[
1444 = 676 + 2ab
\]
Subtracting 676 from both sides, we get:
\[
768 = 2ab
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
ab = 384

Therefore, the value of \(AB \cdot AC\) is:

"To solve for the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-positive integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.
\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are non-positive integers, let's consider the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). If any two of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) are zero, then the third must be 300. Substituting \(a = 300\), \(b = 0\), and \(c = 0\) (or any permutation thereof) into the second equation, we get:

\[
300^2 \cdot 0 + 300^2 \cdot 0 + 0^2 \cdot 300 + 0^2 \cdot 0 + 0^2 \cdot 300 + 0^2 \cdot 300 = 0,
\]

which does not satisfy the equation \(6,000,000 = 6,000,000\). Therefore, none of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) can be zero.

Next, let's consider the case where all three variables are equal. If \(a = b = c\), then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:

\[
100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6,000,000,
\]

which satisfies the equation. Therefore, \((100, 100, 100)\) is a solution.

Now, let's consider the case where two of the variables are equal and the third is different. Without loss of generality, let \(a = b\) and \(c = 300 - 2a\). Substituting these into the second equation, we get:

\[
a^2a + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^2a + a^2(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2a + (300 - 2a)^2a = 6,000,000.
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
2a^3 + 2a^3 + 2a(300 - 2a)^2 = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
4a^3 + 2a(90000 - 1200a + 4a^2) = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
4a^3 + 180000a - 2400a^2 + 8a^3 = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
12a^3 - 2400a^2 + 180000a = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
a^3 - 200a^2 + 15000a = 500000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
a^3 - 200a^2 + 15000a - 500000 = 0.
\]

By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are the factors of \(-500000\) divided by the factors of \(1\). Testing \(a = 100\), we get:

\[
100^3 - 200 \cdot 100^2 + 15000 \cdot 100 - 500000 = 1000000 - 2000000 + 1500000 - 500000 = 0.
\]

Therefore, \(a = 100\) is a root. This means that \(a = b = 100\) and \(c = 300 - 2 \cdot 100 = 100\), which is the same solution we found earlier. There are no other rational roots, so there are no other solutions where two of the variables are equal and the third is different.

Finally, let's consider the case where all three variables are different. If \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are different, then the equation \(abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\) must hold. However, since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are non-positive integers and their sum is 300, the left-hand side of the equation is non-positive, while the right-hand side is positive, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions where all three variables are different.

In conclusion, the only solution is \((100, 100, 100)\). Since the variables are indistinguishable, there is only one ordered triple. The number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) is:

\]
Next, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\). Let \(C\) be \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) is on \(\overline{AB}\), it satisfies the equation \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Also, since \(C\) is not on any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\), the distance from \(C\) to the origin \(O\) must be less than 1. The distance from \(C\) to the origin is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}}
\]
We need to find the value of \(x\) such that \(OC < 1\). Therefore, we solve the inequality:
\[
\sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} < 1
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} < 1 \implies 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} - 1 < 0 \implies 4x^2 - 3x - \frac{1}{4} < 0
\]
Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
16x^2 - 12x - 1 < 0
\]
We solve the quadratic equation \(16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\):
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Since \(C\) is on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), \(x\) must be between 0 and \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, we take the smaller root:
\[
x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\) back into the equation of the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{-3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39} + 4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]
The coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(3 - \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39})^2}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{(3 - \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39})^2}}{8}
\]
Expanding the squares, we get:
\[
(3 - \sqrt{13})^2 = 9 - 6\sqrt{13} + 13 = 22 - 6\sqrt{13}
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39})^2 = 3 + 2\sqrt{117} + 39 = 42 + 2\sqrt{117} = 42 + 2 \cdot 3\sqrt{13} = 42 + 6\sqrt{13}
\]
Adding these together, we get:
\[
(3 - \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39})^2 = 22 - 6\sqrt{13} + 42 + 6\sqrt{13} = 64
\]
Therefore:
\[
OC = \frac{\sqrt{64}}{8} = \frac{8}{8} = 1
\]
However, we need to find the value of \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = 1^2 = 1
\]
Thus, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 1\), and \(p + q = 1 + 1 = 2\). The final answer is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) modulo 1000.

First, observe that the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) can be factored as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).\]
We are interested in the polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at the roots of unity. Notice that:
\[Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x-1)^2 + 1.\]
Thus, we need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).\]

To simplify this, consider the polynomial \(R(x) = x^{13} - 1\) and the polynomial \(S(x) = x^{13} + 1\). The roots of \(S(x)\) are \(-\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We can write:
\[S(x) = (x+1)(x+\omega)(x+\omega^2) \cdots (x+\omega^{12}).\]
Now, consider the polynomial \(T(x) = x^{13} - (-1)^{13} = x^{13} + 1\). The roots of \(T(x)\) are \(-\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We can write:
\[T(x) = (x+1)(x+\omega)(x+\omega^2) \cdots (x+\omega^{12}).\]

We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).\]
Notice that:
\[(\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2.\]
Thus, we need to evaluate:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2).\]
This product can be rewritten as:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

To find this product, we use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be written as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).\]
By substituting \(x = 2\) and \(x = 1\) into the polynomial, we get:
\[2^{13} - 1 = (2-1)(2-\omega)(2-\omega^2) \cdots (2-\omega^{12}) = 1 \cdot (2-\omega)(2-\omega^2) \cdots (2-\omega^{12}).\]
Thus,
\[(2-\omega)(2-\omega^2) \cdots (2-\omega^{12}) = 2^{13} - 1 = 8191.\]

Now, we need to find the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]
Notice that:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2 = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1.\]
Thus, we need to evaluate:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).\]
This product can be rewritten as:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 8191.\]

Finally, we need to find the value of \(8191 \mod 1000\):
\[8191 \mod 1000 = 191.\]

Thus, the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) modulo 1000 is:

"To determine the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there exists a four-digit \( b \)-beautiful number, we need to find a four-digit number \( n \) in base \( b \) such that the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). Let's denote the four-digit number in base \( b \) as \( \overline{abcd}_b \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits and \( a \neq 0 \) (since it is a four-digit number).

The value of \( n \) in base 10 is given by:
\[
n = ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d
\]
We are given that the sum of the digits \( a + b + c + d \) equals \( \sqrt{n} \). Therefore, we have:
\[
a + b + c + d = \sqrt{ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d}
\]

Since \( n \) is a four-digit number in base \( b \), it must satisfy:
\[
b^3 \leq n < b^4
\]
Substituting \( n = ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d \) into the inequality, we get:
\[
b^3 \leq ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d < b^4
\]

First, let's consider the lower bound:
\[
b^3 \leq ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d
\]
Since \( a \geq 1 \), we have:
\[
b^3 \leq ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d \leq b^3 + b^3 + b^3 + b^3 = 4b^3
\]
This inequality is always true for \( b \geq 2 \).

Next, let's consider the upper bound:
\[
ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d < b^4
\]
Since \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are digits in base \( b \), each digit is at most \( b-1 \). Therefore:
\[
ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d \leq (b-1)b^3 + (b-1)b^2 + (b-1)b + (b-1) = (b-1)(b^3 + b^2 + b + 1)
\]
We need:
\[
(b-1)(b^3 + b^2 + b + 1) < b^4
\]
Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
(b-1)(b^3 + b^2 + b + 1) = b^4 - 1
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
b^4 - 1 < b^4
\]
This inequality is always true for \( b \geq 2 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there exists a four-digit number \( n \) in base \( b \) where \( a + b + c + d = \sqrt{n} \). We start by testing small values of \( b \).

**For \( b = 2 \):**
\[
n = ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d = 8a + 4b + 2c + d
\]
\[
a + b + c + d = \sqrt{8a + 4b + 2c + d}
\]
The smallest four-digit number in base 2 is \( 1000_2 = 8_{10} \). The sum of its digits is \( 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \), and \( \sqrt{8} \approx 2.828 \), which is not an integer.

**For \( b = 3 \):**
\[
n = ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d = 27a + 9b + 3c + d
\]
\[
a + b + c + d = \sqrt{27a + 9b + 3c + d}
\]
The smallest four-digit number in base 3 is \( 1000_3 = 27_{10} \). The sum of its digits is \( 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \), and \( \sqrt{27} \approx 5.196 \), which is not an integer.

**For \( b = 4 \):**
\[
n = ab^3 + bb^2 + cb + d = 64a + 16b + 4c + d
\]
\[
a + b + c + d = \sqrt{64a + 16b + 4c + d}
\]
The smallest four-digit number in base 4 is \( 1000_4 = 64_{10} \). The sum of its digits is \( 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \), and \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \), which is an integer.

Thus, \( n = 64 \) is a four-digit \( 4 \)-beautiful number. Therefore, the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there exists a four-digit \( b \)-beautiful number is:

"To determine the number of parihaba that can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) such that each side or diagonal of the dodecagon is a side of the parihaba, we need to analyze the possible configurations of these parihaba.

A parihaba is a quadrilateral formed by connecting four vertices of the dodecagon. The condition given is that each side or diagonal of the dodecagon must be a side of the parihaba. This means that the parihaba must be formed by connecting adjacent vertices of the dodecagon.

Let's consider the vertices of the dodecagon labeled as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12}\) in a clockwise direction. The possible parihaba are formed by selecting four consecutive vertices. For example, one possible parihaba is \(A_1A_2A_3A_4\), another is \(A_2A_3A_4A_5\), and so on. Since the dodecagon has 12 vertices, there are 12 such parihaba.

To verify, let's list all the possible parihaba:
1. \(A_1A_2A_3A_4\)
2. \(A_2A_3A_4A_5\)
3. \(A_3A_4A_5A_6\)
4. \(A_4A_5A_6A_7\)
5. \(A_5A_6A_7A_8\)

12. \(A_{12}A_1A_2A_3\)

"Given the conditions of the problem, we need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let's denote the list of positive integers as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(n\) is the number of items in the list. The conditions are:
1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's assume that 9 appears \(k\) times. The median of the list is the middle number when the list is ordered. If \(n\) is odd, the median is the \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\)-th number. If \(n\) is even, the median is the average of the \(\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\)-th and \(\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)\)-th numbers. Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, \(n\) must be odd (because if \(n\) were even, the median would be the average of two numbers in the list, which could be an integer that appears in the list).

Let's assume \(n = 5\) (the smallest odd number greater than 1, since if \(n = 3\), the median would be 9, which appears in the list). Then the list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, a_4, a_5\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq 9 \leq a_4 \leq a_5\). Since 9 is the mode, \(a_2\) must also be 9. Therefore, the list is \(a_1, 9, 9, a_4, a_5\). The sum of the items is \(a_1 + 9 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 = 30\), which simplifies to \(a_1 + a_4 + a_5 = 12\). The median is 9, which does not appear in the list, so \(a_1 \leq 8\) and \(a_4 \geq 10\). The only possible values for \(a_1, a_4, a_5\) are \(a_1 = 2\), \(a_4 = 10\), and \(a_5 = 0\), but since \(a_5\) must be a positive integer, this is not possible. Therefore, \(n\) cannot be 5.

Since 9 is the mode, \(a_3\) must also be 9. Therefore, the list is \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, a_5, a_6, a_7\). The sum of the items is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 30\), which simplifies to \(a_1 + a_2 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 12\). The median is 9, which does not appear in the list, so \(a_2 \leq 8\) and \(a_5 \geq 10\).

Since 9 is the mode, \(a_4\) must also be 9. Therefore, the list is \(a_1, a_2, a_3, 9, 9, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\). The sum of the items is \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 9 + 9 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 30\), which simplifies to \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 12\). The median is 9, which does not appear in the list, so \(a_3 \leq 8\) and \(a_6 \geq 10\). The only possible values for \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\) are \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 1\), \(a_3 = 1\), \(a_6 = 10\), \(a_7 = 1\), \(a_8 = 1\), and \(a_9 = 1\), but since \(a_6\) must be a positive integer and different from 1, this is not possible. Therefore, \(n\) cannot be 9.

Let's assume \(n = 11\). Then the list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, 9, 9, a_8, a_9, a_{10}, a_{11}\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq a_4 \leq a_5 \leq 9 \leq a_8 \leq a_9 \leq a_{10} \leq a_{11}\).

The sum of the items is \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} = 30\), which simplifies to \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} = 12\). The median is 9, which does not appear in the list, so \(a_4 \leq 8\) and \(a_8 \geq 10\).

We are given two conditions:

From the problem, we know that the grid is a halima way of an array of digits such that \(8 + 991 = 999\) and \(9 + 9 + 81 = 99\). This means that the digits in the grid are 0, 0, 8, 9, 9, and 1.

"To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by converting each equation from logarithmic form to exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{yz \cdot xz \cdot xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we use the property of exponents that states \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}

So,

2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\). Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this expression as:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = \log_2(x^4) + \log_2(y^3) + \log_2(z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(xyz)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding these three equations together, we get:

\[
(\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z)) + (\log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z)) + (\log_2(z) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z) + \log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z) + \log_2(z) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(y) = -\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z) = -\log_2(xyz)
\]

So,

\[
-\log_2(xyz) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Therefore,

\[
\log_2(xyz) = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Substituting \(\log_2(xyz) = -\frac{13}{12}\) back into the expression for \(\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\), we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z) = 4\left(\log_2(xyz) + \log_2(yz)\right) + 3\left(\log_2(xyz) + \log_2(xz)\right) + 2\left(\log_2(xyz) + \log_2(xy)\right)
\]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\left(\log_2(xyz) + \log_2(yz)\right) + 3\left(\log_2(xyz) + \log_2(xz)\right) + 2\left(\log_2(xyz) + \log_2(xy)\right) = 4\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(yz)\right) + 3\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(xz)\right) + 2\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(xy)\right)
\]

Since \(\log_2(yz) = \log_2(y) + \log_2(z)\), \(\log_2(xz) = \log_2(x) + \log_2(z)\), and \(\log_2(xy) = \log_2(x) + \log_2(y)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z)\right) + 3\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(x) + \log_2(z)\right) + 2\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(x) + \log_2(y)\right)
\]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(xyz) - \log_2(x)\right) + 3\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(xyz) - \log_2(y)\right) + 2\left(-\frac{13}{12} + \log_2(xyz) - \log_2(z)\right)
\]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\left(-\frac{13}{12} - \frac{13}{12}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{13}{12} - \frac{13}{12}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{13}{12} - \frac{13}{12}\right) = 4\left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) = -\frac{13}{12}(4 + 3 + 2) = -\frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = -\frac{117}{12} = -\frac{39}{4}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:

\[
m + n = 39 + 4 = 43
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"Given a convex equilateral hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with pairs of opposite sides parallel, we know that the extensions of the segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the length of the sides of the hexagon.

Let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). Since the hexagon is equilateral and has pairs of opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions of \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) is similar to the triangle formed by the lines parallel to \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) passing through the vertices of the hexagon.

The distance between the parallel lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) is \(s\), the distance between \(CD\) and \(EF\) is \(s\), and the distance between \(EF\) and \(AB\) is \(s\). Therefore, the triangle formed by the extensions of \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) is similar to the triangle formed by the lines parallel to \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) passing through the vertices of the hexagon with a similarity ratio of 2 (since each side of the larger triangle is twice the length of the corresponding side of the smaller triangle).

Thus, the side lengths of the smaller triangle are \(s\), \(s\), and \(s\), and the side lengths of the larger triangle are \(2s\), \(2s\), and \(2s\). However, the side lengths of the larger triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. This means that the side lengths of the hexagon must be such that when extended, they form a triangle with side lengths that are twice the side lengths of the hexagon.

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is:
\[
s = \frac{200}{2} = 100, \quad s = \frac{240}{2} = 120, \quad s = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]
However, since the hexagon is equilateral, all side lengths must be equal. This means that the side length of the hexagon must be the average of these three values, but since they are not equal, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

 instead we need to find the correct side length of the hexagon that satisfies the given conditions. The correct approach is to use the fact that the side length of the hexagon is the average of the side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides of the hexagon.

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is:
\[
s = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = 240
\]

Thus, the length of the side of the hexagon is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the sets \(A\) and \(B\). Specifically, for each set \(B\) that Bob lists, the smallest element of \(B\) must be less than or equal to the largest element of \(A\). Let's denote the largest element of \(A\) by \(n\). Then, the smallest element of any set \(B\) can be any integer from 1 to \(n\).

For a given \(n\), the number of possible sets \(B\) is the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) that have a smallest element. For each \(k\) from 1 to \(n\), the number of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) that have \(k\) as the smallest element is \(2^{n-k}\). This is because we can choose any subset of the remaining elements \(\{k+1, k+2, \ldots, n\}\), and there are \(2^{n-k}\) such subsets.

Therefore, the total number of sets \(B\) is:
\[
2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + \cdots + 2^0 = 2^n - 1

We are given that Bob lists 2024 sets, so we set up the equation:
\[
2^n - 1 = 2024

"Given that \( N \) is a positive integer such that the last digit is 1 and \( N \) is divisible by 7, we can express \( N \) in the form \( N = 10k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Since \( N \) is divisible by 7, we have:
\[ 10k + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 10k \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we can substitute 3 for 10:
\[ 3k \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
This is equivalent to:
\[ 3k \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
Dividing both sides by 3 (noting that 3 and 7 are coprime, so 3 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 7, which is 5), we get:
\[ k \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
Thus, we can write \( k \) as:
\[ k = 7m + 2 \]
for some integer \( m \). Substituting back into the expression for \( N \), we get:
\[ N = 10(7m + 2) + 1 = 70m + 21 \]
This tells us that \( N \) is of the form \( 70m + 21 \). We are asked to find \( Q \) and \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000, and then to find \( Q + R \). This means we need to find the quotient and remainder when \( 70m + 21 \) is divided by 1000. The remainder \( R \) must be a number between 0 and 999. Since \( 70m + 21 \) is always less than 1000 for \( m = 0 \) (because \( 70 \times 14 + 21 = 980 + 21 = 1001 \)), the only possible value for \( m \) is 0. Therefore:
\[ N = 70 \cdot 0 + 21 = 21 \]
When 21 is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 0 and the remainder \( R \) is 21. Thus:
\[ Q + R = 0 + 21 = 21 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the two smaller circles that are tangent to the torus \( T \) and the larger sphere \( S \) respectively. We are given that the radius of the torus \( T \) is 3 and the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube is 6. The radius of the larger sphere \( S \) is 11.

First, let's consider the smaller circle \( r_i \) that is tangent to the torus and lies in the plane of the tube. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of this smaller circle is \( 6 - r_i \). The radius of the smaller circle is \( r_i \), and the radius of the tube of the torus is 3. Therefore, the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency of the smaller circle with the tube is \( 6 - r_i - 3 = 3 - r_i \). This distance is also the radius of the smaller circle, so we have:
\[ r_i = 3 - r_i \]
Solving for \( r_i \), we get:
\[ 2r_i = 3 \]
\[ r_i = \frac{3}{2} \]

Next, let's consider the smaller circle \( r_o \) that is tangent to the torus and lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the tube. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of this smaller circle is \( 6 + r_o \). The radius of the smaller circle is \( r_o \), and the radius of the tube of the torus is 3. Therefore, the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency of the smaller circle with the tube is \( 6 + r_o - 3 = 3 + r_o \). This distance is also the radius of the smaller circle, so we have:
\[ r_o = 3 + r_o \]
Solving for \( r_o \), we get:
\[ r_o = 3 + r_o \]
\[ r_o = 3 + \sqrt{11^2 - (6 + 3)^2} \]
\[ r_o = 3 + \sqrt{121 - 81} \]
\[ r_o = 3 + \sqrt{40} \]
\[ r_o = 3 + 2\sqrt{10} \]

Now, we need to find the difference \( r_i - r_o \):
\[ r_i - r_o = \frac{3}{2} - (3 + 2\sqrt{10}) \]
\[ r_i - r_o = \frac{3}{2} - 3 - 2\sqrt{10} \]
\[ r_i - r_o = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{6}{2} - 2\sqrt{10} \]
\[ r_i - r_o = -\frac{3}{2} - 2\sqrt{10} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 25 chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, each row contains exactly one chip, and each column contains exactly one chip. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place 25 chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip. This is the definition of a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of placing the chips.

2. **Counting Permutations**: The number of permutations of a set of \(n\) elements is given by \(n!\) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \(n\). For \(n = 5\), we have:
   \[
   5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
   \]

3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the number of ways to place the 25 chips on the \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip is \(120\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
