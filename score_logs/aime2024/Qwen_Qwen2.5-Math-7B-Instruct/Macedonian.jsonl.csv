"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Aia to walk the 9 kilometers to the coffee shop and then spend \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour.

First, let's use the information given for the two different walking speeds to set up equations.

1. When Aia walks at \( s \) kilometers per hour, she takes 4 hours to walk to the coffee shop and then spends \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop. The total time for the trip is:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours}
   \]
   Since the total distance is 9 kilometers, we can write:
   \[
   s \left( 4 + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9
   \]
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   \[
   4s + \frac{st}{60} = 9 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. When Aia walks at \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, she takes 2 hours and 24 minutes to walk to the coffee shop and then spends \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop. The total time for the trip is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} + \frac{24}{60} \text{ hours} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours} = 2.4 + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours}
   \]
   Since the total distance is still 9 kilometers, we can write:
   \[
   (s + 2) \left( 2.4 + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9
   \]
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   \[
   2.4s + \frac{4.8s}{60} + 4.8 + \frac{2t}{60} = 9
   \]
   Simplifying further, we get:
   \[
   2.4s + 0.08s + 4.8 + \frac{2t}{60} = 9
   \]
   Combining like terms, we get:
   \[
   2.48s + 4.8 + \frac{2t}{60} = 9 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:
1. \( 4s + \frac{st}{60} = 9 \)
2. \( 2.48s + 4.8 + \frac{2t}{60} = 9 \)

To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply both equations by 60:
1. \( 240s + st = 540 \)
2. \( 148.8s + 288 + 2t = 540 \)

Next, we simplify the second equation:
\[
148.8s + 2t = 252
\]
Solving for \( t \), we get:
\[
2t = 252 - 148.8s
\]
\[
t = 126 - 74.4s
\]

Now, we substitute \( t = 126 - 74.4s \) into the first equation:
\[
240s + s(126 - 74.4s) = 540
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
240s + 126s - 74.4s^2 = 540
\]
\[
366s - 74.4s^2 = 540
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
74.4s^2 - 366s + 540 = 0
\]
To simplify, we can divide the entire equation by 7.2:
\[
10.333s^2 - 50.833s + 75 = 0
\]
Multiplying through by 3 to clear the decimal, we get:
\[
31s^2 - 152s + 225 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 31 \), \( b = -152 \), and \( c = 225 \):
\[
s = \frac{152 \pm \sqrt{(-152)^2 - 4 \cdot 31 \cdot 225}}{2 \cdot 31}
\]
\[
s = \frac{152 \pm \sqrt{23104 - 28200}}{62}
\]
\[
s = \frac{152 \pm \sqrt{196}}{62}
\]
\[
s = \frac{152 \pm 14}{62}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
s = \frac{166}{62} = 2.7 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{138}{62} = 2.2
\]
Since \( s = 2.7 \) does not satisfy the conditions of the problem (it would make \( t \) negative), we have \( s = 2.2 \).

Now, we substitute \( s = 2.2 \) back into the equation for \( t \):
\[
t = 126 - 74.4 \cdot 2.2
\]
\[
t = 126 - 163.68
\]
\[
t = -37.68 \quad \text{( mistake }

"Given a triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\), and the line \(\overline{AD}\) intersects \(\omega\) at \(P\). We are given \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), and we need to find the length of \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, and then determine \(m + n\).

First, we use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the power of \(D\) with respect to the circle is the same for any two intersecting chords or tangents. Specifically, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is given by:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]

Since \(DB\) and \(DC\) are tangents to the circle from point \(D\), they are equal in length. Let \(DB = DC = x\). Then:
\[
x^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). By the properties of tangents from a point to a circle, \(DB\) and \(DC\) are equal, and \(D\) lies on the radical axis of the circle and the degenerate circle at point \(A\). Therefore, \(D\) is the excenter of the triangle \(ABC\) opposite to vertex \(A\).

The length of the tangents from a point to a circle can be found using the formula:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{\frac{(s-b)(s-c)}{s-a}}
\]
where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle \(ABC\). First, we calculate \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]

Now, we substitute \(s\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the formula for the tangents:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{\frac{(12-9)(12-10)}{12-5}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \cdot 2}{7}} = \sqrt{\frac{6}{7}}
\]

Thus, \(x = \sqrt{\frac{6}{7}}\).

Next, we use the Power of a Point theorem again to find \(AP\):
\[
x^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]
\[
\left(\sqrt{\frac{6}{7}}\right)^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]
\[
\frac{6}{7} = DA \cdot DP
\]

Since \(D\) is the excenter opposite to \(A\), \(DA\) is the distance from \(A\) to the excenter. The length of \(DA\) can be found using the formula for the distance from a vertex to the excenter:
\[
DA = \frac{bc}{s-a}
\]
Substituting \(b\), \(c\), and \(s\):
\[
DA = \frac{9 \cdot 10}{12-5} = \frac{90}{7}
\]

Now, we substitute \(DA\) back into the equation:
\[
\frac{6}{7} = \frac{90}{7} \cdot DP
\]

Solving for \(DP\):
\[
DP = \frac{\frac{6}{7}}{\frac{90}{7}} = \frac{6}{90} = \frac{1}{15}
\]

Finally, we find \(AP\):
\[
AP = AD - DP = \frac{90}{7} - \frac{1}{15}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 15 is 105:
\[
AP = \frac{90 \cdot 15}{7 \cdot 15} - \frac{1 \cdot 7}{15 \cdot 7} = \frac{1350}{105} - \frac{7}{105} = \frac{1343}{105}
\]

Thus, \(AP\) is in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 1343\) and \(n = 105\). Since 1343 and 105 are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 1343 + 105 = 1448
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{1448}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon with vertices colored red, blue, or green can be rotated such that all the green vertices end up in the positions where the red vertices initially were. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of colorings:**
   Each of the 8 vertices can be one of 3 colors (red, blue, or green). Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:
   \[
   3^8 = 6561
   \]

2. **Determine the favorable colorings:**
   For the octagon to be rotated such that all the green vertices end up in the positions where the red vertices initially were, the green vertices must form a subset of the vertices that can be rotated to align with the red vertices. This means that the green vertices must be in positions that are multiples of some integer \( k \) (where \( k \) is a divisor of 8) when the octagon is rotated.

   The possible values for \( k \) are 1, 2, 4, and 8. However, \( k = 1 \) is not possible because it would mean all vertices are green, which is not a valid scenario since we need at least one red vertex. Therefore, we only need to consider \( k = 2, 4, \) and \( 8 \).

   - For \( k = 2 \): The green vertices must be in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7. There are \( 3^4 = 81 \) ways to color these 4 positions (each can be red, blue, or green), and the remaining 4 positions (2, 4, 6, 8) must be red. So, there are 81 favorable colorings.
   - For \( k = 4 \): The green vertices must be in positions 1, 5 or 2, 6 or 3, 7 or 4, 8. There are \( 3^2 = 9 \) ways to color these 2 positions (each can be red, blue, or green), and the remaining 6 positions must be red. So, there are 9 favorable colorings.
   - For \( k = 8 \): The green vertices must be in position 1. There are \( 3^1 = 3 \) ways to color this position (it can be red, blue, or green), and the remaining 7 positions must be red. So, there are 3 favorable colorings.

   Adding these up, the total number of favorable colorings is:
   \[
   81 + 9 + 3 = 93
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the green vertices end up in the positions where the red vertices initially were is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings:
   \[
   \frac{93}{6561}
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction:**
   To simplify \(\frac{93}{6561}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 93 and 6561. The prime factorization of 93 is \(3 \times 31\), and the prime factorization of 6561 is \(3^8\). The only common factor is 3. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
   \[
   \frac{93 \div 3}{6561 \div 3} = \frac{31}{2187}
   \]

   The fraction \(\frac{31}{2187}\) is in its simplest form because 31 is a prime number and does not divide 2187.

5. **Find \( m + n \):**
   In the fraction \(\frac{31}{2187}\), \( m = 31 \) and \( n = 2187 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 31 + 2187 = 2218 \).

The final answer is:

"To find the number of points of intersection of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we start by analyzing the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

The function \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( |x| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).

Similarly, the function \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( |x| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).

Next, we need to determine the range of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \). Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \) both take values in the interval \([-1, 1]\), we evaluate \( f \) at the endpoints and at the midpoint of this interval:
- \( f(-1) = f(1) = |1| - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \).
- \( f(0) = \frac{1}{2} - |0| = \frac{1}{2} \).

Thus, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) both take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) both take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\).

Now, we consider the equations \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). Since \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) are in \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\), it follows that \( y \) and \( x \) are in the interval \([0, 1]\).

We need to find the points \((x, y)\) in the unit square \([0, 1] \times [0, 1]\) that satisfy both equations. Let's analyze the behavior of the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

For \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):
- If \( \sin(2\pi x) = 0 \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( y = 4 g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 4 \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}\right) = 1 \).
- If \( \sin(2\pi x) = \pm 1 \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( y = 4 g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1 \).
- If \( 0 < |\sin(2\pi x)| < 1 \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \) and \( y = 4 g\left(\frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)|\right) = 4 \left(\frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{4}\right) = 1 - 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| \).

For \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):
- If \( \cos(3\pi y) = 0 \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( x = 4 g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1 \).
- If \( \cos(3\pi y) = \pm 1 \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( x = 4 g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1 \).
- If \( 0 < |\cos(3\pi y)| < 1 \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| \) and \( x = 4 g\left(\frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)|\right) = 4 \left(\frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{4}\right) = 1 - 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| \).

The equations \( y = 1 - 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| \) and \( x = 1 - 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| \) describe two families of curves. The first family of curves \( y = 1 - 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| \) is a series of parabolas opening downwards with vertices at \( (k/2, 1) \) for integers \( k \). The second family of curves \( x = 1 - 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| \) is a series of parabolas opening downwards with vertices at \( (1, k/3) \) for integers \( k \).

The points of intersection occur where these curves intersect within the unit square. By symmetry and periodicity, we can see that there are 6 points of intersection: \((0, 1)\), \((1, 0)\), \((\frac{1}{2}, 1)\), \((1, \frac{1}{2})\), \((\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4})\), and \((\frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{4})\).

Therefore, the number of points of intersection is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is the smallest prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's identify the smallest prime \( p \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). We start by checking small prime numbers.

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( n^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{4} \) for any integer \( n \), \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) is impossible. Therefore, \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{9}
   \]
   We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{9} \). We test the values \( n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   0^4 &\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   1^4 &\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\
   2^4 &\equiv 16 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\
   3^4 &\equiv 81 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   4^4 &\equiv 256 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}, \\
   5^4 &\equiv 625 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}, \\
   6^4 &\equiv 1296 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   7^4 &\equiv 2401 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\
   8^4 &\equiv 4096 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   None of these values satisfy \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{9} \). Therefore, \( p = 3 \) is not a solution.

3. **For \( p = 5 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[

   None of these values satisfy \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{25} \). Therefore, \( p = 5 \) is not a solution.

4. **For \( p = 17 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289}
   \]
   We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \). We test the values \( n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 288 \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}

   \vdots \\
   288^4 &\equiv 6635521 \equiv 16 \pmod{289}.
   \]
   We find that \( n = 17 \) satisfies \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \).

Thus, the smallest prime \( p \) is \( 17 \). We need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We test \( m = 17 \):
\[
17^4 + 1 = 83521 + 1 = 83522
\]
We check if \( 83522 \) is divisible by \( 289 \):
\[
83522 \div 289 = 288
\]
Since \( 83522 \div 289 = 288 \) is an integer, \( 83522 \) is divisible by \( 289 \).

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is:

"To find the point \( I \) inside the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) such that the distances from \( I \) to each face are equal, we need to determine the inradius of the tetrahedron. The inradius \( r \) of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{A}
\]

where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( A \) is the total surface area of the tetrahedron.

First, we calculate the area of each face of the tetrahedron. The faces are triangles with sides \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \). We use Heron's formula to find the area of each triangle.

For triangle \( ABC \):
- semi-perimeter \( s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \)
- area \( \Delta_{ABC} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})} \)

Similarly, we calculate the areas of triangles \( ABD \), \( ACD \), and \( BCD \).

Next, we sum the areas of all four faces to get the total surface area \( A \).

Then, we calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant:

\[
288V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\
1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\
1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\
1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given side lengths:
\[
AB^2 = 41, \quad AC^2 = 80, \quad AD^2 = 89, \quad BC^2 = 89, \quad BD^2 = 80, \quad CD^2 = 41
\]

\[
288V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We compute this determinant to find \( V \).

Finally, we substitute \( V \) and \( A \) into the formula for the inradius \( r \) and simplify to express \( r \) in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \).

After performing the calculations, we find:

\[
r = \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}
\]

and determine \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \). The final answer is:

\[
m + n + p

"To solve for the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain all rectangular prisms in the set \(\mathcal{B}\), we need to determine the maximum possible length of the space diagonal of any rectangular prism in \(\mathcal{B}\). The space diagonal \( d \) of a rectangular prism with side lengths \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

We are given that the surface area \( S \) and the volume \( V \) of each rectangular prism are 54 and 23, respectively. Therefore, we have the equations:

\[
S = 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54
\]
\[
V = abc = 23
\]

First, we simplify the surface area equation:

\[
ab + bc + ca = 27
\]

We need to find the maximum value of \( d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \). To do this, we use the identity:

\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]

Substituting \( ab + bc + ca = 27 \) into the identity, we get:

\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54
\]

Solving for \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \), we have:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 54
\]

To maximize \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \), we need to maximize \( a + b + c \). We use the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative real numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

Substituting \( abc = 23 \) into the inequality, we get:

\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{23}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 3, we have:

\[
a + b + c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23}
\]

To find the exact value of \( a + b + c \), we consider the possibility that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are close to each other. We test if \( a = b = c \) is a solution. If \( a = b = c \), then:

\[
a^3 = 23 \implies a = \sqrt[3]{23}
\]

Substituting \( a = b = c = \sqrt[3]{23} \) into the surface area equation:

\[
2(\sqrt[3]{23} \cdot \sqrt[3]{23} + \sqrt[3]{23} \cdot \sqrt[3]{23} + \sqrt[3]{23} \cdot \sqrt[3]{23}) = 2 \cdot 3(\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 6(\sqrt[3]{23})^2
\]

Setting this equal to 54, we get:

\[
6(\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 54
\]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 9
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
\sqrt[3]{23} = 3
\]

This is not possible since \( \sqrt[3]{23} \neq 3 \). Therefore, \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are not all equal. We need to find another approach to maximize \( a + b + c \).

Given the complexity, we use numerical methods or trial and error to find the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that satisfy both equations. By trial, we find:

\[
a \approx 1.5, \quad b \approx 3, \quad c \approx 4.6667
\]

Using these values, we calculate:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \approx 1.5^2 + 3^2 + 4.6667^2 \approx 27.5
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) is approximately 27.5. Therefore, the maximum value of \( d \) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{27.5} = \sqrt{\frac{110}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{110}}{2}
\]

The radius \( r \) of the sphere is:

\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{110}}{2}
\]

Finally, we find \( r^2 \):

\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{110}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{110}{4} = \frac{55}{2}
\]

Thus, \( p = 55 \) and \( q = 2 \), and \( p + q = 55 + 2 = 57 \).

"To solve the given equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each logarithmic expression.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the logarithm power rule \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we can rewrite this as:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \implies x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \implies \log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Using the logarithm power rule again, we can rewrite this as:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10 \implies 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \implies \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(y)}{4y} = \frac{5 \log(y)}{2y}
\]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log(y)\) and \(\log(x)\):
1. \(\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\)
2. \(\log(x) = \frac{5 \log(y)}{2y}\)

We can substitute the expression for \(\log(y)\) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
\log(x) = \frac{5}{2y} \left( \frac{10 \log(x)}{x} \right) = \frac{50 \log(x)}{2xy} = \frac{25 \log(x)}{xy}
\]
Assuming \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):
\[
1 = \frac{25}{xy} \implies xy = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move can force a win.

Let's start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If \( n = 0 \), the player whose turn it is to move loses immediately because there are no coins left.
- If \( n = 1 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and win.
- If \( n = 2 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 1 coin for the opponent, who will then win.
- If \( n = 3 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 2 coins for the opponent, who will then lose.
- If \( n = 4 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 4 coins and win.
- If \( n = 5 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 4 coins for the opponent, who will then win.
- If \( n = 6 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 5 coins for the opponent, who will then lose.
- If \( n = 7 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 6 coins for the opponent, who will then win.
- If \( n = 8 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 4 coins and leave 4 coins for the opponent, who will then win.
- If \( n = 9 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 8 coins for the opponent, who will then lose.
- If \( n = 10 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 9 coins for the opponent, who will then win.
- If \( n = 11 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 10 coins for the opponent, who will then lose.
- If \( n = 12 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 4 coins and leave 8 coins for the opponent, who will then win.
- If \( n = 13 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 12 coins for the opponent, who will then lose.
- If \( n = 14 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 13 coins for the opponent, who will then win.
- If \( n = 15 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 coin and leave 14 coins for the opponent, who will then lose.
- If \( n = 16 \), the player whose turn it is to move can take 4 coins and leave 12 coins for the opponent, who will then win.

From this pattern, we can see that the losing positions are \( n = 2, 6, 10, 14, \ldots \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and common difference 4. The general form of the \( k \)-th term of this sequence is:
\[ n = 2 + (k-1) \cdot 4 = 4k - 2 \]

We need to find the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 4k - 2 \leq 2024 \):
\[ 4k - 2 \leq 2024 \]
\[ 4k \leq 2026 \]
\[ k \leq 506.5 \]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \( k \) is 506. Therefore, there are 506 losing positions less than or equal to 2024. The number of winning positions is the total number of positive integers less than or equal to 2024 minus the number of losing positions:
\[ 2024 - 506 = 1518 \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{1518}\).","[1518, '1518']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that Јen obtains the main prize given that she obtains any prize. This involves calculating the probabilities of two events: the event that she obtains the main prize and the event that she obtains any prize.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 different numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to find the number of ways to obtain the main prize, which means all four chosen numbers are distinct and randomly chosen from \( S \). Since all numbers are distinct and randomly chosen, the number of ways to obtain the main prize is the same as the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is 210.

Now, we need to find the number of ways to obtain any prize. This means that at least two of the chosen numbers are the same. We will use the complement principle to find this. The complement of obtaining any prize is obtaining no prize, which means all four chosen numbers are distinct. We already know that there are 210 ways to choose 4 distinct numbers. Therefore, the number of ways to obtain any prize is:

\[
210 - 210 = 0
\]

However, this is not correct because we need to consider the condition that at least two numbers are the same. Let's re-eide the problem.

We need to find the number of ways to obtain any prize. We need to consider the cases where at least two numbers are the same. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two are the same is the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers minus the number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers. We already know that there are 210 ways to choose 4 distinct numbers. Therefore, the number of ways to obtain any prize is:

\[
210 - 210 = 0

"Given the right-angled trapezoids \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) such that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, we need to find the length of \(CE\). We are given \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

First, we note that since \(ABCD\) is a right-angled trapezoid, \(AB\) and \(CD\) are perpendicular to \(BC\) and \(AD\). Similarly, \(EFGH\) is a right-angled trapezoid, so \(EF\) and \(GH\) are perpendicular to \(FG\) and \(EH\).

Since \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, \(AD\) and \(GH\) are parallel and equal in length. Let \(AD = GH = x\). The length of \(CD\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(BCD\):
\[
CD = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 256} = \sqrt{11705} = 108.2.
\]
Similarly, the length of \(EH\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(EFH\):
\[
EH = \sqrt{EF^2 + FG^2} = \sqrt{184^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{33856 + 289} = \sqrt{34145} = 184.8.
\]
Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the length of \(CE\) is the difference between \(CD\) and \(EF\):
\[
CE = CD - EF = 108.2 - 184.8 = -76.6.
\]
However, since \(CE\) is a length, we take the absolute value:
\[
CE = 184.8 - 108.2 = 76.
\]
Thus, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{184}\).","[184, '184']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of paths on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, and the changes in direction occur at points where the path switches from moving right to up or vice versa.

First, let's consider the structure of such a path. Since the path changes direction exactly four times, it must consist of five segments of either right or up moves. For example, a path might look like RRRUURRRUURR. Here, the path changes direction at the 3rd, 6th, 8th, and 11th positions.

To count the number of such paths, we need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (after the first move) where the path can change direction. This is a combinatorial problem where we are choosing 4 positions out of 15 to place the changes in direction. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4!(15-4)!} = \frac{15!}{4! \cdot 11!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365

Therefore, the number of paths on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times is \(\boxed{1365}\).","[1365, '1365']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"Given the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the maximum possible real part of this expression.

First, let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:
\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
We can expand this using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\):
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]
Distributing the terms, we get:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 4i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).
\]
Combining the real and imaginary parts, we get:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]
The real part of this expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). To find the maximum value of this real part, we can use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so we have:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given that it is formed by the tangency points of 84 circles of radius 34 and 2024 circles of radius 1 arranged in a specific pattern.

First, let's analyze the arrangement of the circles. The 84 circles of radius 34 are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, with each circle touching its neighbors. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles of radius 34 is \(2 \times 34 = 68\). This distance is also the side length of the hexagon formed by the centers of these circles.

The hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each with side length 68. The distance from the center of the hexagon to any of its vertices (which is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the hexagon) is equal to the side length of the hexagon, which is 68.

Now, let's consider the two circles of radius 1 that are tangent to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\). The distance from the center of each of these circles to the point of tangency is 1. Therefore, the distance from the center of the hexagon to the point of tangency of the circle of radius 1 with the side \(AB\) or \(BC\) is \(68 + 1 = 69\).

This distance is also the radius of the circumscribed circle of triangle \(ABC\). The inradius \(r\) of a triangle can be found using the formula:
\[
r = \frac{A}{s}
\]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter.

The semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + CA}{2}
\]

Since the circles of radius 1 are tangent to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\), the lengths of these sides are:
\[
AB = BC = 2 \times 69 = 138
\]

To find the length of side \(CA\), we need to consider the arrangement of the circles. The side \(CA\) is formed by the distance between the centers of the two circles of radius 34 at the ends of the hexagon plus the distance between the centers of the two circles of radius 1 at the points of tangency with \(CA\). The distance between the centers of the two circles of radius 34 at the ends of the hexagon is \(2 \times 68 = 136\). The distance between the centers of the two circles of radius 1 at the points of tangency with \(CA\) is \(2 \times 1 = 2\). Therefore, the length of side \(CA\) is:
\[
CA = 136 + 2 = 138
\]

Thus, triangle \(ABC\) is an equilateral triangle with side length 138. The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(a\) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2
\]
Substituting \(a = 138\), we get:
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 138^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 19044 = 4761\sqrt{3}
\]

The semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
s = \frac{138 + 138 + 138}{2} = \frac{414}{2} = 207
\]

The inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
r = \frac{A}{s} = \frac{4761\sqrt{3}}{207} = 23\sqrt{3}
\]

The inradius can be expressed as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 23\sqrt{3}\) and \(n = 1\). However, since \(m\) and \(n\) must be integers and \(m\) and \(n\) must be relatively prime, we need to rationalize the expression. The correct form is:
\[
r = \frac{69}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{69\sqrt{3}}{3} = 23\sqrt{3}
\]

Thus, the correct form is:
\[
r = \frac{69}{2}
\]

Therefore, \(m = 69\) and \(n = 2\), and \(m + n = 69 + 2 = 71\).

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the largest real number \(k\) such that \(BD^2 > k\) for all rhombi \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

First, recall that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Since they intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices of the rhombus can be expressed as \((a, b)\), \((-a, b)\), \((-a, -b)\), and \((a, -b)\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2b\), so \(BD^2 = 4b^2\).

Since the points \((a, b)\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1.
\]
We can solve for \(a^2\) in terms of \(b^2\):
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} = 1 + \frac{b^2}{24},
\]
\[
a^2 = 20\left(1 + \frac{b^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{5b^2}{6}.
\]
The length of the diagonal \(AC\) is \(2a\), so \(AC^2 = 4a^2\). Substituting the expression for \(a^2\) into this equation, we get:
\[
AC^2 = 4\left(20 + \frac{5b^2}{6}\right) = 80 + \frac{20b^2}{3}.
\]
In a rhombus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to four times the square of the side length. Let \(s\) be the side length of the rhombus. Then:
\[
AC^2 + BD^2 = 4s^2.
\]
Since \(BD^2 = 4b^2\), we have:
\[
80 + \frac{20b^2}{3} + 4b^2 = 4s^2.
\]
Combining the terms involving \(b^2\), we get:
\[
80 + \frac{20b^2}{3} + \frac{12b^2}{3} = 4s^2,
\]
\[
80 + \frac{32b^2}{3} = 4s^2.
\]
Dividing through by 4, we obtain:
\[
20 + \frac{8b^2}{3} = s^2.
\]
Since \(s^2\) is always positive, the term \(\frac{8b^2}{3}\) must be positive, which implies \(b^2 > 0\). The smallest value of \(b^2\) is 0, but since \(b^2 > 0\), the smallest possible value of \(BD^2 = 4b^2\) is greater than 0. However, we need to find the largest real number \(k\) such that \(BD^2 > k\) for all rhombi. As \(b^2\) approaches 0, \(BD^2\) approaches 0, but it never actually reaches 0. Therefore, the largest real number \(k\) that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is:

"To determine the number of residents on Aijmville who have all four works of art, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's define the following sets:

- \( A \): the set of residents who have a diamond ring.
- \( B \): the set of residents who have a set for golf.
- \( C \): the set of residents who have a gardeners' log.
- \( D \): the set of residents who have a cookie with bonbons in the shape of a heart.

We are given the following information:
- \( |A| = 195 \)
- \( |B| = 367 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- \( |D| = 900 \) (since every resident has a cookie with bonbons in the shape of a heart)
- \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 \) (the number of residents who have exactly two works of art)
- \( |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 \) (the number of residents who have exactly three works of art)
- \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = x \) (the number of residents who have all four works of art)

According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, the total number of residents who have at least one work of art is given by:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Since every resident has a cookie with bonbons in the shape of a heart, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
\[
900 = 2024 - 437 + 234 - x
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
900 = 1821 - x
\]

Solving for \( x \), we subtract 1821 from both sides:
\[
x = 1821 - 900
\]
\[
x = 921

Therefore, the number of residents on Aijmville who have all four works of art is \(\boxed{921}\).","[921, '921']",73,"[73, '73']",False
"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \) such that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the radius of the circumcircle \( R = 13 \), and the radius of the incircle \( r = 6 \), we need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall that the distance \( d \) between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( d = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OIA = 90^\circ \). In this right triangle, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \) and \( IA = r = 6 \). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \( OA \):
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 = 13 + 6^2 = 13 + 36 = 49
\]
Thus, \( OA = \sqrt{49} = 7 \). Since \( OA \) is the radius of the circumcircle, we have \( R = 7 \), but we already know \( R = 13 \), so this is consistent with the given information.

Next, we use the formula for the area \( \Delta \) of triangle \( ABC \) in terms of its circumradius \( R \) and its sides \( a, b, c \):
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
We also use the formula for the area \( \Delta \) in terms of its inradius \( r \) and its semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
\frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we have:
\[
\frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} = 6s \implies \frac{abc}{52} = 6s \implies abc = 312s
\]
We need to find \( AB \cdot AC = bc \). Using the identity \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( a, b, \) and \( c \). However, we can use another useful identity involving the circumradius \( R \) and the sides of the triangle:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4R^2 + 4r^2 + 4Rr
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4 \cdot 13^2 + 4 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 4 \cdot 169 + 4 \cdot 36 + 4 \cdot 78 = 676 + 144 + 312 = 1132
\]
We also know from the right triangle \( OIA \) that:
\[
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
\]
Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( \angle OAI = 90^\circ - \angle OIA = 90^\circ - \angle A \), and thus \( \cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area can also be expressed in terms of the sides and the circumradius:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{bc \cdot a}{4 \cdot 13} = \frac{bc \cdot a}{52}
\]
Since \( \Delta = r \cdot s = 6s \), we have:
\[
\frac{bc \cdot a}{52} = 6s \implies bc \cdot a = 312s
\]
We need to find \( bc \). Using the identity \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( a, b, \) and \( c \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area can also be expressed in terms of the sides and the circumradius:
\[
bc = \frac{abc}{a} = \frac{312s}{a}
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we can use the fact that \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1132 \) and the identity \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4R^2 + 4r^2 + 4Rr \):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4R^2 + 4r^2 + 4Rr = 4 \cdot 13^2 + 4 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 676 + 144 + 312 = 1132
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
bc = \frac{312s}{a} = \frac{312 \cdot \frac{a+b+c}{2}}{a} = \frac{312(a+b+c)}{2a} = \frac{312a + 312b + 312c}{2a} = \frac{312a}{2a} + \frac{312b}{2a} + \frac{312c}{2a} = 156 + \frac{156b}{a} + \frac{156c}{a}

"To find the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the conditions \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing through by 3, we get:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.
\]

We need to find integer solutions to this equation. Let's consider the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). If any two of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) are zero, then the equation simplifies to \(abc = 0\), which is not possible since \(abc\) would be zero and the right-hand side would be \(-2,000,000\). Therefore, none of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) can be zero.

Next, let's consider the case where two of the variables are equal. Without loss of generality, assume \(a = b\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
a^2c + a^2c + a^2c + ac^2 + ac^2 + ac^2 = 6,000,000,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
6a^2c + 2a^2c = 6,000,000,
\]

or:

\[
8a^2c = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing through by 8, we get:

\[
a^2c = 750,000.
\]

Since \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a = b\), we have \(2a + c = 300\), or \(c = 300 - 2a\). Substituting this into the equation \(a^2c = 750,000\), we get:

\[
a^2(300 - 2a) = 750,000,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
300a^2 - 2a^3 = 750,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
2a^3 - 300a^2 + 750,000 = 0,
\]

or:

\[
a^3 - 150a^2 + 375,000 = 0.
\]

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of 375,000 divided by the factors of 1. Testing \(a = 150\), we get:

\[
150^3 - 150 \cdot 150^2 + 375,000 = 3375000 - 3375000 + 375000 = 375000 - 375000 = 0.
\]

So, \(a = 150\) is a root. Therefore, \(a = 150\), \(b = 150\), and \(c = 300 - 2 \cdot 150 = 0\), which is not a valid solution since \(c\) cannot be zero. However, we can also consider the permutations of \((150, 150, 0)\), which gives us 3 solutions: \((150, 150, 0)\), \((150, 0, 150)\), and \((0, 150, 150)\).

Now, let's consider the case where all three variables are equal. If \(a = b = c\), then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equation \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we get:

\[
100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6 \cdot 1,000,000 = 6,000,000.
\]

So, \((100, 100, 100)\) is a valid solution. There is only 1 permutation of \((100, 100, 100)\), which is \((100, 100, 100)\).

Adding the number of solutions from both cases, we get:

\[
3 + 1 = 4.
\]

Therefore, the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given conditions is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",601,"[601, '601']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The points \(A\) and \(B\) are given as \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and the point \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Next, we consider a general segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with \(P = (a, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, b)\) such that the length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1. The distance formula gives:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 1 \implies a^2 + b^2 = 1
\]
The equation of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[
y = -\frac{b}{a}x + b
\]
We need to find the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(C\) can be written as \((x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\) for some \(x\) in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\). For \(C\) to lie on \(\overline{PQ}\), it must satisfy the equation of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\):
\[
-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{b}{a}x + b
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{b}{a}x + b \implies x\left(\frac{b}{a} - \sqrt{3}\right) = b - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x = \frac{b - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{b}{a} - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{ab - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a}{b - \sqrt{3}a}
\]
For \(C\) to not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\), \(x\) must not be in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) for any \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and \(a, b > 0\). We need to find the value of \(x\) that is not in this interval for any such \(a\) and \(b\).

Consider the function \(f(a, b) = \frac{ab - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a}{b - \sqrt{3}a}\). We need to find the value of \(x\) that is not in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) for any \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and \(a, b > 0\). By symmetry and the properties of the function, we can see that the value of \(x\) that is not in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) is \(x = \frac{1}{2}\).

Substituting \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) into the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), which is the point \(A\). However, we need to find the point \(C\) that is not \(A\) or \(B\). By symmetry and the properties of the function, we can see that the value of \(x\) that is not in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) is \(x = \frac{1}{4}\).

Substituting \(x = \frac{1}{4}\) into the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). The values of \(p\) and \(q\) are 1 and 4, respectively. Thus, \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).

"Given that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) has roots \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000.

First, observe that the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) can be rewritten as \(P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1\). Therefore, the product we are interested in is:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be factored as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).
\]
By substituting \(x = 1\) into the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\), we get:
\[
1^{13} - 1 = 0,
\]
which is true. This implies that:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1.
\]

Now, consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{13} - 1\) and substitute \(x = \omega^k\) into \(P(x)\). We have:
\[
P(\omega^k) = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1.
\]
We need to find the value of the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).
\]

To simplify this, we use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be written as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).
\]
By substituting \(x = \omega^k\) into the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\), we get:
\[
\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0,
\]
which is true for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) = (-1)^{12} \cdot 1 = 1.
\]

Now, we need to find the value of:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).
\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) = ((\omega^0 - 1)^2 + 1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).
\]
Since \(\omega^0 = 1\), we have:
\[
(\omega^0 - 1)^2 + 1 = (1 - 1)^2 + 1 = 1.
\]
Therefore, the product simplifies to:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).
\]

Next, we use the fact that:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} \left( \frac{\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 1 + 1}{\omega^k - 1} \right) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} \left( \frac{\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2}{\omega^k - 1} \right).
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} \left( \frac{\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2}{\omega^k - 1} \right) = \frac{\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2)}{\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k - 1)}.
\]
Since \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) = 1\), we have:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2).
\]

Now, we need to find the value of:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2).
\]
We can use the fact that \(\omega^{2k} = (\omega^k)^2\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k)^2 - 2\omega^k + 2).
\]
This is the same as:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).
\]

Finally, we need to find the value of:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-ubavi positive integers. A \( b \)-ubavi integer \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \) whose digits sum to \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express a two-digit number \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are its digits, and \( 1 \leq a < b \) and \( 0 \leq c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-ubavi is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]

Since \( n = ab + c \), we substitute \( n \) in the equation:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{ab + c} \]

To eliminate the square root, we square both sides:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]

Expanding the left-hand side:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]

Rearranging the terms to form a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + a^2 - ab = 0 \]

This is a standard quadratic equation of the form \( c^2 + Bc + C = 0 \), where \( B = 2a - 1 \) and \( C = a^2 - ab \). We solve for \( c \) using the quadratic formula:
\[ c = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2} \]

Substituting \( B \) and \( C \):
\[ c = \frac{-(2a - 1) \pm \sqrt{(2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab)}}{2} \]
\[ c = \frac{-2a + 1 \pm \sqrt{4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab}}{2} \]
\[ c = \frac{-2a + 1 \pm \sqrt{-4a + 4ab + 1}}{2} \]
\[ c = \frac{-2a + 1 \pm \sqrt{4a(b - 1) + 1}}{2} \]

For \( c \) to be an integer, the expression inside the square root must be a perfect square. Let:
\[ 4a(b - 1) + 1 = k^2 \]
for some integer \( k \). Rearranging this equation:
\[ k^2 - 1 = 4a(b - 1) \]
\[ (k - 1)(k + 1) = 4a(b - 1) \]

Since \( k - 1 \) and \( k + 1 \) are consecutive even numbers (if \( k \) is odd) or consecutive odd numbers (if \( k \) is even), their product is always divisible by 4. Therefore, \( 4a(b - 1) \) must be divisible by 4, which implies \( a(b - 1) \) must be an integer.

We need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than ten solutions for \( a \) and \( c \) satisfying the equation \( (k - 1)(k + 1) = 4a(b - 1) \) and \( 1 \leq a < b \) and \( 0 \leq c < b \).

"To determine the number of right-angled rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on or along a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the possible orientations of the rectangle.

A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. The sides of the rectangle can be aligned along the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. The diagonals of a dodecagon can be categorized into different lengths, and we need to count the number of rectangles that can be formed for each type of diagonal.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the possible orientations of the rectangle:**
   - The rectangle can be aligned such that its sides are parallel to the sides of the dodecagon.
   - The rectangle can be aligned such that its sides are parallel to the diagonals of the dodecagon.

2. **Count the number of rectangles aligned with the sides of the dodecagon:**
   - For each side of the dodecagon, we can choose any two adjacent vertices to form the width of the rectangle. There are 12 sides, and for each side, there are 10 possible choices for the width (since we can choose any two adjacent vertices out of the remaining 10 vertices).
   - However, this counts each rectangle twice (once for each pair of adjacent sides), so we need to divide by 2.
   - Therefore, the number of rectangles aligned with the sides of the dodecagon is:
     \[
     \frac{12 \times 10}{2} = 60
     \]

3. **Count the number of rectangles aligned with the diagonals of the dodecagon:**
   - The diagonals of a dodecagon can be categorized into different lengths. We need to count the number of rectangles that can be formed for each type of diagonal.
   - For each type of diagonal, we can choose any two parallel diagonals to form the length and width of the rectangle. The number of ways to choose two parallel diagonals depends on the length of the diagonal.
   - After careful analysis, we find that there are 12 diagonals of length 2, 12 diagonals of length 4, 6 diagonals of length 6, 4 diagonals of length 8, and 2 diagonals of length 10.
   - For each type of diagonal, we can form a rectangle by choosing any two parallel diagonals. The number of ways to choose two parallel diagonals is:
     - For diagonals of length 2: \(\binom{12}{2} = 66\)
     - For diagonals of length 4: \(\binom{12}{2} = 66\)
     - For diagonals of length 6: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\)
     - For diagonals of length 8: \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\)
     - For diagonals of length 10: \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\)
   - However, this counts each rectangle twice (once for each pair of parallel diagonals), so we need to divide by 2.
   - Therefore, the number of rectangles aligned with the diagonals of the dodecagon is:
     \[
     \frac{66 + 66 + 15 + 6 + 1}{2} = 51
     \]

4. **Add the number of rectangles aligned with the sides and the diagonals:**
   - The total number of right-angled rectangles that can be formed is:
     \[
     60 + 51 = 111
     \]

Therefore, the number of right-angled rectangles that can be formed inside the regular dodecagon is \(\boxed{111}\).","[111, '111']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions and then find the sum of the squares of these elements.

1. **Sum of elements**: The sum of the elements in the list is 30.
2. **Mode**: The only mode of the list is 9, which means 9 appears more frequently than any other number.
3. **Median**: The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Let's denote the list of elements as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\). Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Let's assume \(n = 2k\). The median will be the average of the \(k\)-th and \((k+1)\)-th elements when the list is sorted.

Given that 9 is the mode, let's assume it appears \(m\) times. Since 9 is the only mode, \(m > 1\) and \(m \leq k\) (because the median is not 9).

Let's start by considering the smallest possible value for \(m\), which is 2. If \(m = 2\), then the list must have at least 4 elements (since the median is not 9). Let's assume the list is sorted and the first two 9's are at positions \(k\) and \(k+1\). The median will be \(\frac{a_k + a_{k+1}}{2}\), and since the median is not 9, \(a_k\) and \(a_{k+1}\) must be different from 9.

Let's try \(k = 3\), so the list has 6 elements. The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, a_5, a_6\). The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + a_5 + a_6 = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_5 + a_6 = 12.\]
Since \(a_5\) and \(a_6\) are different from 9, they must be positive integers less than 9. Let's try \(a_5 = 1\) and \(a_6 = 2\):
\[a_1 + a_2 + 1 + 2 = 12 \implies a_1 + a_2 = 9.\]
The possible pairs \((a_1, a_2)\) are \((1, 8)\), \((2, 7)\), \((3, 6)\), and \((4, 5)\). However, if \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_2 = 8\), then 1 appears more frequently than 9, which contradicts the condition that 9 is the only mode. Similarly, if \(a_1 = 2\) and \(a_2 = 7\), then 2 appears more frequently than 9. If \(a_1 = 3\) and \(a_2 = 6\), then 3 appears more frequently than 9. If \(a_1 = 4\) and \(a_2 = 5\), then 4 appears more frequently than 9, which is not possible since 9 is the only mode.

Therefore, \(m\) must be greater than 2. Let's try \(m = 3\). If \(m = 3\), then the list must have at least 6 elements. Let's assume the list is sorted and the first three 9's are at positions \(k-1\), \(k\), and \(k+1\). The median will be \(\frac{a_k + a_{k+1}}{2}\), and since the median is not 9, \(a_k\) and \(a_{k+1}\) must be different from 9.

Let's try \(k = 4\), so the list has 8 elements. The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, a_3, 9, 9, 9, a_7, a_8\). The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_7 + a_8 = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_7 + a_8 = 3.\]
Since \(a_7\) and \(a_8\) are different from 9, they must be positive integers less than 9. The only possible pair \((a_7, a_8)\) is \((1, 2)\). Therefore, \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 0\), which is not possible since \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) are positive integers.

Let's try \(k = 5\), so the list has 10 elements. The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, 9, 9, 9, a_8, a_9, a_{10}\). The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10} = 3.\]
Since \(a_8\) and \(a_9\) are different from 9, they must be positive integers less than 9. The only possible pair \((a_8, a_9)\) is \((1, 2)\). Therefore, \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1\), which is not possible since \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\) are positive integers.

Let's try \(k = 6\), so the list has 12 elements. The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, 9, 9, 9, a_9, a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}\). The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12} = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12} = 3.\]
Since \(a_9\) and \(a_{10}\) are different from 9, they must be positive integers less than 9. The only possible pair \((a_9, a_{10})\) is \((1, 2)\). Therefore, \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 1\), which is not possible since \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\) are positive integers.

Therefore, the correct list is \(1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 9, 9\). The sum of the squares of the elements is:
\[1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 273.\]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by reading from left to right is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by reading from top to bottom is 99.

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The two three-digit numbers formed by reading from left to right are \(abc\) and \(def\). Therefore, we have the equation:
\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
\]

The three two-digit numbers formed by reading from top to bottom are \(10a + b\), \(10d + e\), and \(10c + f\). Therefore, we have the equation:
\[
10a + b + 10d + e + 10c + f = 99

We can simplify these equations by considering the constraints on the digits \(a, b, c, d, e,\) and \(f\). Each digit must be between 0 and 9.

First, let's analyze the second equation:
\[
10a + b + 10d + e + 10c + f = 99
\]

Since \(a, b, c, d, e,\) and \(f\) are digits, the maximum value for \(10a + 10d + 10c\) is \(10 \times 9 + 10 \times 9 + 10 \times 9 = 270\), which is much greater than 99. Therefore, \(a, d,\) and \(c\) must be such that their sum is less than or equal to 9.

Given that \(a, d,\) and \(c\) are digits, the only possible values for \(a, d,\) and \(c\) are 0, 1, and 2. Let's consider each case:

1. **Case 1: \(a = 0\), \(d = 0\), \(c = 0\)**

"To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by expressing each equation in exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{yz \cdot xz \cdot xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(xyz)^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

And simplifying the right side, we use the property of exponents that states \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]

So,

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\). Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this expression as:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = \log_2(x^4) + \log_2(y^3) + \log_2(z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(xyz)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding these three equations together, we get:

\[
(\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z)) + (\log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z)) + (\log_2(z) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
-\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Therefore,

\[
-\log_2(xyz) = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Since \(\log_2(xyz) = -\frac{13}{12}\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z) = 4\left(\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z) + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z)\right) - 2\log_2(x) - 3\log_2(y) - 2\log_2(z) = 4\left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) = -\frac{52}{12} = -\frac{13}{3}
\]

The absolute value is:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \frac{13}{3}
\]

Thus, \(m = 13\) and \(n = 3\), and \(m+n = 13+3 = 16\). The final answer is:

"Given a convex hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon, given that the sides of the triangle formed by extending the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are 200, 240, and 300.

First, let's denote the length of each side of the hexagon by \(s\). Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, we can use the properties of similar triangles to solve the problem.

When we extend the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\), they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. Let's call this triangle \(PQR\), where \(P\) is the intersection of the extensions of \(AB\) and \(CD\), \(Q\) is the intersection of the extensions of \(CD\) and \(EF\), and \(R\) is the intersection of the extensions of \(EF\) and \(AB\).

Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle \(PQR\) is similar to the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon. The sides of the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon are equal to the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides of the hexagon. Therefore, the sides of the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon are \(2s\), \(2s\), and \(2s\).

The triangle \(PQR\) is similar to the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon with a ratio of similarity equal to 2. This means that the sides of triangle \(PQR\) are twice the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon. Therefore, the sides of triangle \(PQR\) are \(4s\), \(4s\), and \(4s\).

However, we know that the sides of triangle \(PQR\) are 200, 240, and 300. This means that the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon must have sides that are half of 200, 240, and 300, which are 100, 120, and 150. This is not possible since the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon must have equal sides.

Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the properties of the hexagon again. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, we can use the properties of similar triangles to solve the problem.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the set \( A \) such that the number of non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \) is 2024. Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the number of subsets \( B \) where \( a_i \) is the maximum element is the number of subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1\} \). This is because any subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1\} \) can be combined with \( a_i \) to form a valid subset \( B \). The number of subsets of a set with \( a_i-1 \) elements is \( 2^{a_i-1} \).

Therefore, the total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets for each element in \( A \):
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

We need to find a set of integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that the sum of the powers of 2 equals 2024. First, we convert 2024 to its binary representation:
\[
2024_{10} = 11111100010_2
\]

This binary representation tells us that:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^1
\]

Thus, the set \( A \) consists of the integers corresponding to the positions of the 1's in the binary representation:
\[
A = \{1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}
\]

To find the sum of the elements in \( A \), we calculate:
\[
1 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[

"1. **Define the number \( N \):**
   Let \( N \) be a four-digit positive integer with digits \( a, b, c, d \). Therefore, we can express \( N \) as:
   \[
   N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d

2. **Set up the condition for divisibility by 7:**
   According to the problem, if any one of the digits of \( N \) is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. This gives us four equations:
   \[
   1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

   \[
   1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

   \]
   \[
   1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

3. **Simplify each congruence:**
   First, we need to find the remainders of \( 1000, 100, 10, \) and \( 1 \) when divided by 7:
   \[
   1000 \div 7 = 142 \text{ remainder } 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   100 \div 7 = 14 \text{ remainder } 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   10 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

4. **Substitute these remainders into the congruences:**
   \[
   6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

   \]
   \[
   6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
   \]

5. **Solve for \( d \):**
   Since all four congruences are identical, we can use any one of them to find \( d \):
   \[
   6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   d \equiv -6a - 2b - 3c \pmod{7}

6. **Determine the range of \( N \):**
   Since \( N \) is a four-digit number, \( 1000 \leq N \leq 9999 \). Therefore, \( Q \) (the quotient when \( N \) is divided by 1000) ranges from 1 to 9.

7. **Find the smallest \( N \) that satisfies the condition:**
   We start with \( Q = 1 \):
   \[
   N = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
   \]
   \[
   d \equiv 1 + 5b + 4c \pmod{7}
   \]
   We need \( d \) to be a digit (0 through 9). We test values of \( b \) and \( c \) to find a valid \( d \).

   For \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \):
   \[
   d \equiv 1 + 5(0) + 4(0) \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
   \]
   \[
   N = 1000 + 100(0) + 10(0) + 1 = 1001
   \]
   Check if \( 1001 \) satisfies the condition:
   \[
   1001 \div 7 = 143 \quad \text{(integer)}
   \]
   \[
   1001 + 1 = 1002 \quad \text{and} \quad 1002 \div 7 = 143 \quad \text{(integer)}
   \]
   \[
   1001 - 1 = 1000 \quad \text{and} \quad 1000 \div 7 = 142 \quad \text{(integer)}
   \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles where the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) from the inside and outside, respectively. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere has a radius of 11.

First, let's find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus. The center of the tube of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the circle that is being rotated. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus is 6 units.

The radius of the tube of the torus is 3 units. When the torus is tangent to the sphere from the inside, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus minus the radius of the tube of the torus is equal to the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the circle that is being rotated. This gives us:
\[
6 - 3 = 11 - r_i \implies r_i = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

When the torus is tangent to the sphere from the outside, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the tube of the torus plus the radius of the tube of the torus is equal to the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the circle that is being rotated. This gives us:
\[
6 + 3 = 11 + r_o \implies r_o = 6 + 3 - 11 = 8 - 5 = 1
\]

The difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 8 - 1 = 7
\]

Since 7 is already in its simplest form, we have \( m = 7 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 7 + 1 = 8 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 25 white and 25 black chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row or column have the same color, and any additional chip placed on the grid would violate either of the first two conditions.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the possible configurations:**
   - We can place chips in such a way that each row and each column contains either all white chips or all black chips.
   - This means we can choose any subset of rows to place white chips and the remaining rows to place black chips. Similarly, we can choose any subset of columns to place white chips and the remaining columns to place black chips.

2. **Count the number of ways to choose the rows and columns:**
   - There are \(2^5 = 32\) possible subsets of rows (including the empty set and the set of all rows).
   - Similarly, there are \(2^5 = 32\) possible subsets of columns.
   - However, we need to exclude the case where all rows and all columns are empty (i.e., no chips are placed), and we also need to exclude the case where all rows and all columns are filled with chips (i.e., all 25 chips are placed in one color).

3. **Calculate the valid configurations:**
   - The total number of ways to choose the rows and columns is \(32 \times 32 = 1024\).
   - Excluding the two invalid cases (no chips and all chips in one color), we have \(1024 - 2 = 1022\) valid configurations.

Therefore, the number of ways to place the chips on the grid is \(\boxed{1022}\).","[1022, '1022']",902,"[902, '902']",False
