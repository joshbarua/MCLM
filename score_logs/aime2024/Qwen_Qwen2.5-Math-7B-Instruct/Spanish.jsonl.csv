"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time Aya spends caminating and the time she spends in the cafeteria. Let's start by setting up the equations based on the given information.

First, we know that when Aya camina at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the caminata is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in the cafeteria. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, \( t \) minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Therefore, the time she spends caminating is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance she covers while caminating is 9 kilometers, so we can write the equation:
\[
s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9
\]
Multiplying both sides by 60 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
60s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 540
\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
240s - st = 540 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, we know that when Aya camina at a speed of \( s+2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the caminata is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes in the cafeteria. Converting 2 hours and 24 minutes to hours, we get \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours. Therefore, the time she spends caminating is \( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance she covers while caminating is still 9 kilometers, so we can write the equation:
\[
(s+2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9
\]
Multiplying both sides by 60 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
60(s+2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 540
\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
144s + 480 - st - 2t = 540
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
144s - st - 2t = 60 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
240s - st = 540 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
144s - st - 2t = 60 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

To eliminate \( st \), we subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
\[
(240s - st) - (144s - st - 2t) = 540 - 60
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
240s - st - 144s + st + 2t = 480
\]
The \( st \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[
96s + 2t = 480
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
48s + t = 240
\]
Solving for \( t \), we get:
\[
t = 240 - 48s
\]

Now we substitute \( t = 240 - 48s \) back into equation (1):
\[
240s - s(240 - 48s) = 540
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
240s - 240s + 48s^2 = 540
\]
The \( 240s \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[
48s^2 = 540
\]
Dividing both sides by 48, we get:
\[
s^2 = \frac{540}{48} = \frac{45}{4}
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides, we get:
\[
s = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \( s = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2} \) back into the expression for \( t \):
\[
t = 240 - 48 \left( \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2} \right) = 240 - 72\sqrt{5}
\]

Finally, we need to find the time Aya spends caminating when she camina at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour. The time she spends caminating is:
\[
\left( s + \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
\]
Substituting \( s = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( t = 240 - 72\sqrt{5} \), we get:
\[
\left( \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( 4 - \frac{240 - 72\sqrt{5}}{60} \right) = \left( \frac{3\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \right) \left( 4 - 4 + 1.2\sqrt{5} \right) = \left( \frac{3\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \right) \left( 1.2\sqrt{5} \right)
\]
Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
\left( \frac{3\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{6\sqrt{5}}{5} \right) = \frac{(3\sqrt{5} + 1) \cdot 6\sqrt{5}}{10} = \frac{18 \cdot 5 + 6\sqrt{5}}{10} = \frac{90 + 6\sqrt{5}}{10} = 9 + \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}
\]

The total time for the caminata is the time she spends caminating plus the time she spends in the cafeteria:
\[
9 + \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5} + 240 - 72\sqrt{5} = 249 + \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5} - \frac{360\sqrt{5}}{5} = 249 - \frac{357\sqrt{5}}{5}
\]

Since \( \frac{357\sqrt{5}}{5} \) is not an integer, we need to recheck the problem.legatelegate re Leone re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in the circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\). Therefore, we have:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). We need to find the length of \(AP\). To do this, we will use the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle in terms of the sides of the triangle. The length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\) is given by:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Now, we substitute \(DB = 5\sqrt{2}\) into the power of a point equation:
\[
(5\sqrt{2})^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]
\[
50 = DA \cdot DP
\]

We need to find \(DA\). Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), \(D\) is the excenter of the triangle \(ABC\) opposite to vertex \(A\). The length \(DA\) can be found using the formula for the distance from a vertex to the excenter:
\[
DA = \frac{bc}{s - a}
\]
where \(b = AC = 10\), \(c = AB = 5\), and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]

Substituting the values of \(b\), \(c\), and \(s\) into the formula for \(DA\), we get:
\[
DA = \frac{10 \cdot 5}{12 - 5} = \frac{50}{7}
\]

Now, we substitute \(DA = \frac{50}{7}\) back into the power of a point equation:
\[
50 = \frac{50}{7} \cdot DP
\]

Solving for \(DP\), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{7}{50}\):
\[
DP = 7
\]

Finally, we find \(AP\) using the fact that \(AD = AP + PD\):
\[
AP = AD - PD = \frac{50}{7} - 7 = \frac{50}{7} - \frac{49}{7} = \frac{1}{7}
\]

Thus, \(AP\) is \(\frac{1}{7}\). The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 1 and 7, respectively. Therefore, \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 1 + 7 = 8
\]

The final answer is:

"To determine the probability that an octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in positions where originally there were red vertices, we need to analyze the possible colorings of the octagon and the constraints given by the rotation.

First, let's consider the total number of possible colorings of the octagon. Since each vertex can be either red or blue, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of favorable colorings. For the octagon to be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in positions where originally there were red vertices, the number of blue vertices must be a multiple of 8 (since the octagon has 8 vertices and we are rotating it). The only possible number of blue vertices that satisfies this condition is 0 or 8.

- If there are 0 blue vertices, then all vertices are red. There is only 1 such coloring.
- If there are 8 blue vertices, then all vertices are blue. There is only 1 such coloring.

Therefore, there are \(1 + 1 = 2\) favorable colorings.

The probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in positions where originally there were red vertices is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of possible colorings:
\[
\frac{2}{256} = \frac{1}{128}
\]

Since 1 and 128 are coprime, the fraction \(\frac{1}{128}\) is in its simplest form. Thus, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 128\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 1 + 128 = 129
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{129}

"To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then determine the points where these two equations are satisfied simultaneously.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Consider \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( \sin (2 \pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to evaluate \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \):
- If \( |\sin (2 \pi x)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin (2 \pi x)| \).
- If \( |\sin (2 \pi x)| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) = |\sin (2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

Next, we evaluate \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \):
- If \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin (2 \pi x)) \).
- If \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = f(\sin (2 \pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \).

Thus, \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) becomes:
- If \( |\sin (2 \pi x)| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( y = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \left( \frac{1}{2} - |\sin (2 \pi x)| \right) \right) = 4 \left( |\sin (2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 |\sin (2 \pi x)| - 1 \).
- If \( \frac{1}{4} < |\sin (2 \pi x)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( y = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \left( |\sin (2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right) \right) = 4 \left( \frac{3}{4} - |\sin (2 \pi x)| \right) = 3 - 4 |\sin (2 \pi x)| \).
- If \( |\sin (2 \pi x)| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( y = 4 \left( |\sin (2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 \left( |\sin (2 \pi x)| - \frac{3}{4} \right) = 4 |\sin (2 \pi x)| - 3 \).

### Step 4: Consider \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)
Similarly, since \( \cos (3 \pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to evaluate \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \):
- If \( |\cos (3 \pi y)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos (3 \pi y)| \).
- If \( |\cos (3 \pi y)| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) = |\cos (3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

Next, we evaluate \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \):
- If \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos (3 \pi y)) \).
- If \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) = f(\cos (3 \pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \).

Thus, \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) becomes:
- If \( |\cos (3 \pi y)| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( x = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \left( \frac{1}{2} - |\cos (3 \pi y)| \right) \right) = 4 \left( |\cos (3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 |\cos (3 \pi y)| - 1 \).
- If \( \frac{1}{4} < |\cos (3 \pi y)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( x = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \left( |\cos (3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \right) \right) = 4 \left( \frac{3}{4} - |\cos (3 \pi y)| \right) = 3 - 4 |\cos (3 \pi y)| \).
- If \( |\cos (3 \pi y)| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( x = 4 \left( |\cos (3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 \left( |\cos (3 \pi y)| - \frac{3}{4} \right) = 4 |\cos (3 \pi y)| - 3 \).

### Step 5: Find the intersections
We need to solve the system of equations:
\[ y = 4 |\sin (2 \pi x)| - 1 \]
\[ x = 4 |\cos (3 \pi y)| - 1 \]

By symmetry and periodicity of the sine and cosine functions, we can analyze the behavior over one period. The function \( y = 4 |\sin (2 \pi x)| - 1 \) has a period of \( \frac{1}{2} \) and ranges from \(-1\) to \(3\). Similarly, \( x = 4 |\cos (3 \pi y)| - 1 \) has a period of \( \frac{2}{3} \) and ranges from \(-1\) to \(3\).

By analyzing the graphs and their periodicity, we find that there are 6 intersections in one period of \( x \) and 4 periods of \( y \) within one period of \( x \). Therefore, the total number of intersections is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of intersections of the graphs is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"To find the smallest prime number \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), we start by examining the congruence \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \), so the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, and 8. However, since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the order cannot be 1, 2, or 4. Therefore, the order must be 8.

This means that \( n \) is a primitive 8th root of unity modulo \( p^2 \). The polynomial whose roots are the primitive 8th roots of unity is \( x^4 + 1 \). For \( x^4 + 1 \) to have a root modulo \( p^2 \), \( p^2 \) must divide the discriminant of the polynomial \( x^4 + 1 \) when it is factored over the integers. The polynomial \( x^4 + 1 \) can be factored as \( (x^2 + \sqrt{2}x + 1)(x^2 - \sqrt{2}x + 1) \) over the integers, but we need to consider it modulo \( p^2 \).

The discriminant of \( x^4 + 1 \) is \( 256 \), and we need \( p^2 \) to divide \( 256 \). The prime factorization of 256 is \( 2^8 \), so the only prime \( p \) that satisfies this condition is \( p = 2 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \). We check the values of \( m \) modulo 4:
- If \( m \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).

None of these values satisfy \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \) except when we consider higher powers of 2. We need to check modulo 8:
- If \( m \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).
- If \( m \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \).
- If \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).
- If \( m \equiv 3 \pmod{8} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \).
- If \( m \equiv 4 \pmod{8} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).
- If \( m \equiv 5 \pmod{8} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 5^4 + 1 \equiv 625 + 1 \equiv 626 \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \).
- If \( m \equiv 6 \pmod{8} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 6^4 + 1 \equiv 1296 + 1 \equiv 1297 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).
- If \( m \equiv 7 \pmod{8} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 7^4 + 1 \equiv 2401 + 1 \equiv 2402 \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \).

We need to check modulo 16:
- If \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{16} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{16} \).
- If \( m \equiv 6 \pmod{16} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 6^4 + 1 \equiv 1296 + 1 \equiv 1297 \equiv 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{16} \).

"To find the distance from the point \( I \) inside the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its faces, we need to use the concept of the volume of the tetrahedron and the fact that \( I \) is the incenter of the tetrahedron. The incenter is the point where the perpendiculars from \( I \) to each face are equal.

First, we calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \). We use the Cayley-Menger determinant for this purpose. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a = AB \), \( b = AC \), \( c = AD \), \( d = BC \), \( e = BD \), and \( f = CD \) is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = \sqrt{89} \), \( e = \sqrt{80} \), and \( f = \sqrt{41} \), we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
288 V^2 = -\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Next, we perform row operations to simplify the determinant. Subtract the first row from the other rows:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & -41 & 9 & -9 \\
0 & 45 & -80 & -48 \\
0 & 39 & -39 & -89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Now, factor out the common factors from the second, third, and fourth rows:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & -41 & 9 & -9 \\
0 & 45 & -80 & -48 \\
0 & 39 & -39 & -89
\end{vmatrix} = -41 \cdot 9 \cdot 45 \cdot 39 \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{9}{41} & \frac{9}{41} \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{80}{45} & -\frac{48}{45} \\
0 & 1 & -1 & -\frac{89}{39}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Simplify the fractions:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{9}{41} & \frac{9}{41} \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{16}{9} & -\frac{16}{9} \\
0 & 1 & -1 & -\frac{89}{39}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Subtract the second row from the third and fourth rows:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{9}{41} & \frac{9}{41} \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{16}{9} + \frac{9}{41} & -\frac{16}{9} - \frac{9}{41} \\
0 & 0 & -1 + \frac{9}{41} & -\frac{89}{39} - \frac{9}{41}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Convert the fractions to a common denominator:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{369}{1681} & \frac{369}{1681} \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{640}{369} & -\frac{640}{369} \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{32}{41} & -\frac{32}{41}
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Factor out the common factors from the third and fourth rows:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{369}{1681} & \frac{369}{1681} \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{640}{369} & -\frac{640}{369} \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{32}{41} & -\frac{32}{41}
\end{vmatrix} = -\frac{640}{369} \cdot -\frac{32}{41} \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & 1 & -\frac{369}{1681} & \frac{369}{1681} \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

The last two rows are identical, so the determinant is zero. This indicates an error in simplification. Re}""

"Given a rectangular box with surface area \(54\) and volume \(23\), we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain this box. The dimensions of the box are denoted by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area and volume of the box are given by the equations:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54
\]
\[
abc = 23
\]
The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is half the length of the space diagonal of the box. The length of the space diagonal is given by:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]
Therefore, the radius \(r\) is:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}
\]
To find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we use the identity:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We already know that \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\), so:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54
\]
Next, we need to find \(a+b+c\). We use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]
We need to find the value of \(a+b+c\). Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are real numbers, we can use numerical methods or trial and error to find the roots. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the polynomial must have real roots and check possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of \(-23\) divided by the factors of \(1\), which are \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm 23\).

By testing these values, we find that \(t = 1\) is a root:
\[
1^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot 1^2 + 27 \cdot 1 - 23 = 1 - (a+b+c) + 27 - 23 = 5 - (a+b+c) = 0 \implies a+b+c = 5
\]
Now we substitute \(a+b+c = 5\) into the equation for \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 5^2 - 54 = 25 - 54 = -29
\]
However, this result is incorrect because it should be positive. Let's recheck the problem constraints and recompute the correct value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\). correct value is recompute correct value re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re re

"To solve the given equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each logarithmic expression.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, which states that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
Solving for \(\log_x(y)\), we get:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Again, using the power rule of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
Solving for \(\log_y(x)\), we get:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\):
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

We know that \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\) are reciprocals of each other because \(\log_x(y) \cdot \log_y(x) = 1\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{10}{x} \cdot \frac{5}{2y} = 1
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\frac{50}{2xy} = 1
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(2xy\), we obtain:
\[
50 = 2xy
\]

Solving for \(xy\), we get:
\[
xy = \frac{50}{2} = 25

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position if the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Let's define \( L \) as a losing position and \( W \) as a winning position. The base cases are:
- \( n = 0 \) is a losing position \( L \) because the player who faces 0 fishas loses.
- \( n = 1 \) is a winning position \( W \) because the player can take the last fisha.
- \( n = 2 \) is a winning position \( W \) because the player can take 1 fisha, leaving the opponent with 1 fisha.
- \( n = 3 \) is a winning position \( W \) because the player can take 1 fisha, leaving the opponent with 2 fishas.
- \( n = 4 \) is a losing position \( L \) because the player can only take 1 or 4 fishas, leaving the opponent with 3 or 0 fishas, both of which are winning positions.

For \( n \geq 5 \), we can determine the position by considering the possible moves from \( n \):
- If \( n \) is a losing position, then \( n-1 \) and \( n-4 \) must both be winning positions.
- If \( n \) is a winning position, then at least one of \( n-1 \) or \( n-4 \) must be a losing position.

Using this recursive definition, we can extend the pattern:
- \( n = 5 \) is a winning position \( W \) because \( n-1 = 4 \) is a losing position.
- \( n = 6 \) is a winning position \( W \) because \( n-1 = 5 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 7 \) is a winning position \( W \) because \( n-1 = 6 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 8 \) is a losing position \( L \) because \( n-1 = 7 \) and \( n-4 = 4 \) are both winning positions.

We observe that the pattern repeats every 5 numbers: \( L, W, W, W, L \).

To find the number of losing positions \( L \) less than or equal to 2024, we need to count the multiples of 5 within this range. The multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024 are:
\[ 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \]

This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a = 5 \) and the common difference \( d = 5 \). The \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]

Setting \( a_n = 2020 \):
\[ 2020 = 5 + (n-1) \cdot 5 \]
\[ 2020 = 5 + 5n - 5 \]
\[ 2020 = 5n \]
\[ n = \frac{2020}{5} \]
\[ n = 404 \]

Thus, there are 404 multiples of 5 between 1 and 2024. Therefore, there are 404 losing positions \( L \) for Bob.

The number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is:
\[ 2024 - 404 = 1620 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem, which we can solve using the formula for conditional probability:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

Here, event \( A \) is Jen winning the grand prize, and event \( B \) is Jen winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means winning all four numbers, \( A \cap B = A \). Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(A) \), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. Jen wins the grand prize if she picks exactly the same 4 numbers as the 4 numbers drawn. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):

\[ \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210 \]

Since there is only one way to pick the exact 4 numbers drawn, the probability \( P(A) \) is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that Jen wins a prize. Jen wins a prize if she picks at least 2 of the 4 numbers drawn. We can use the complement rule to find \( P(B) \). The complement of event \( B \) is the event that Jen picks fewer than 2 of the 4 numbers drawn, which means she picks either 0 or 1 of the 4 numbers drawn.

1. **Probability of picking 0 of the 4 numbers drawn:**
   Jen picks 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since none of the 4 numbers drawn are chosen). The number of ways to do this is \( \binom{6}{4} \):

   \[ \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15 \]

   So, the probability of picking 0 of the 4 numbers drawn is:

   \[ P(\text{0 numbers}) = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} \]

2. **Probability of picking 1 of the 4 numbers drawn:**
   Jen picks 1 number from the 4 numbers drawn and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers. The number of ways to do this is \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} \):

   \[ \binom{4}{1} = 4 \]
   \[ \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 \]
   \[ \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

   So, the probability of picking 1 of the 4 numbers drawn is:

   \[ P(\text{1 number}) = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21} \]

The probability of picking fewer than 2 of the 4 numbers drawn is the sum of the probabilities of picking 0 and 1 of the 4 numbers drawn:

\[ P(\text{fewer than 2 numbers}) = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 21 is 42:

\[ \frac{1}{14} = \frac{3}{42} \]
\[ \frac{8}{21} = \frac{16}{42} \]
\[ P(\text{fewer than 2 numbers}) = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42} \]

Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is:

\[ P(B) = 1 - P(\text{fewer than 2 numbers}) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42} \]

Now, we can find the conditional probability \( P(A \mid B) \):

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{210 \times 23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115} \]

The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is:

"Dado que $ABCD$ y $EFGH$ son rectángulos y $D, E, C, F$ son colineales, con $A, D, H, G$ en un círculo,我们可以利用圆内接四边形的性质和勾股定理来找到 $CE$ 的长度。

首先, note that since $A, D, H, G$ are concyclic, the opposite angles of the quadrilateral $ADHG$ sum to $180^\circ$. This implies that $\angle ADH + \angle AGH = 180^\circ$. Since $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are rectangles, $\angle ADH = 90^\circ$ and $\angle AGH = 90^\circ$, which is consistent with the property of cyclic quadrilaterals.

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles $ABD$ and $EFG$. For triangle $ABD$, we have:
\[
BD = \sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + AD^2} = \sqrt{11449 + AD^2}
\]
For triangle $EFG$, we have:
\[
EG = \sqrt{EF^2 + FG^2} = \sqrt{184^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{33856 + 289} = \sqrt{34145}
\]

Since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear, the length $CE$ can be expressed as the difference between $EG$ and $BD$:
\[
CE = EG - BD = \sqrt{34145} - \sqrt{11449 + AD^2}
\]

We also know that $BD$ is the same as the diagonal of rectangle $ABCD$, which is the same as the diagonal of rectangle $EFGH$ minus the segment $EF$ plus the segment $BC$. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the power of point $D$ with respect to the circle is the same for both circles. The power of point $D$ is given by:
\[
AD \cdot DH = BD^2 - AD^2 = BD^2 - AD^2
\]
Since $A, D, H, G$ are concyclic, we can use the fact that the power of point $D$ is also equal to:
\[
AD \cdot DH = AD \cdot (AD + DF) = AD \cdot (AD + BC) = AD \cdot (AD + 16)
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
BD^2 - AD^2 = AD^2 + 16AD
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
BD^2 = 2AD^2 + 16AD
\]
Substituting $BD = \sqrt{11449 + AD^2}$, we have:
\[
11449 + AD^2 = 2AD^2 + 16AD
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
11449 = AD^2 + 16AD
\]
This is a quadratic equation in $AD$. Solving for $AD$, we use the quadratic formula $AD = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = 16$, and $c = -11449$:
\[
AD = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11449)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{256 + 45796}}{2} = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{46052}}{2} = \frac{-16 \pm 214.6}{2}
\]
Taking the positive root, we get:
\[
AD = \frac{198.6}{2} = 99.3
\]

Now, we substitute $AD = 99.3$ back into the expression for $BD$:
\[
BD = \sqrt{11449 + 99.3^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 9860.49} = \sqrt{21309.49} = 145.98
\]

Finally, we find $CE$:
\[
CE = EG - BD = \sqrt{34145} - 145.98 = 184.23 - 145.98 = 38.25
\]

Thus, the length of $CE$ is:

"To determine the number of paths of length 16 that follow the lines from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner in an \(8 \times 8\) grid and change direction exactly four times, we need to analyze the structure of such paths.

A path from the bottom-left corner \((0,0)\) to the top-right corner \((8,8)\) consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. A change in direction occurs when an R move is followed by a U move or a U move is followed by an R move. Since the path changes direction exactly four times, there must be exactly four R's followed by U's and four U's followed by R's. This means the path must start with either an R or a U and alternate directions four times.

Let's consider the two cases:

1. **The path starts with an R:**
   - The path will be in the form RURURURU.
   - We need to place the remaining 4 R's and 4 U's in the remaining 8 positions, but they must be placed in such a way that they do not change direction again. This means we need to place the remaining R's and U's in pairs (RR andUU).
   - The number of ways to arrange 4 pairs of RR andUU in 8 positions is the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 8 for the RR pairs (the remaining positions will automatically be UU pairs), which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\).

2. **The path starts with a U:**
   - The path will be in the form URURURUR.
   - Similarly, we need to place the remaining 4 R's and 4 U's in the remaining 8 positions, but they must be placed in such a way that they do not change direction again. This means we need to place the remaining R's and U's in pairs (RR andUU).
   - The number of ways to arrange 4 pairs of RR andUU in 8 positions is the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 8 for the RR pairs (the remaining positions will automatically be UU pairs), which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\).

Since there are 2 cases (starting with R or starting with U) and each case has 1 way to arrange the path, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:

"Given the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the maximum real part of this expression.

First, let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:
\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

We expand both products:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 4i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).

The real part of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given that it contains two sequences of circles: one sequence of 8 circles of radius 34 and another sequence of 2024 circles of radius 1, both arranged in a specific tangential pattern.

### Step 1: Analyze the arrangement of the circles of radius 34
The 8 circles of radius 34 are arranged such that each circle is tangent to its two neighbors and to two sides of the triangle. This forms a regular octagon inscribed in a larger circle.

The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles of radius 34 is \(2 \times 34 = 68\). The radius \(R\) of the circumscribed circle of this octagon can be found using the formula for the circumradius of a regular octagon:
\[
R = \frac{a}{2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)}
\]
where \(a\) is the side length of the octagon. Here, \(a = 68\).

First, we need to find \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\):
\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}
\]

Substituting \(a\) and \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\) into the formula for \(R\):
\[
R = \frac{68}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}} = \frac{68}{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}
\]

Rationalize the denominator:
\[
R = \frac{68 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{(2 - \sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2})}} = \frac{68 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{4 - 2}} = \frac{68 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{2}} = 68 \sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}} = 68 \cdot \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the arrangement of the circles of radius 1
Similarly, the 2024 circles of radius 1 are arranged in a regular octagon. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles of radius 1 is \(2 \times 1 = 2\). The radius \(r\) of the circumscribed circle of this octagon is:
\[
r = \frac{2}{2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)} = \frac{2}{\frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}
\]

Rationalize the denominator:
\[
r = \frac{4 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{(2 - \sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2})}} = \frac{4 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{2}} = 4 \sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}} = 4 \cdot \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]

### Step 3: Relate the radii to the inradius of triangle \(ABC\)
The inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is the sum of the radii of the two octagons plus the distance between the centers of the two octagons. The distance between the centers of the two octagons is the difference in their radii:
\[
R - r = 68 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} - 4 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 64 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]

Thus, the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
r = 64 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} + 4 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 68 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the expression for the inradius
We need to express \(68 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). First, rationalize the expression inside the square root:
\[
1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Thus:
\[
68 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 68 \sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}} = 68 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{2}} = 68 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2} = 68 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}}{2} = 34 \sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify further if possible
The expression \(34 \sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) is already in its simplest form. Therefore, we have:
\[
m = 34 \quad \text{and} \quad n = 1
\]

Thus, \(m + n = 34 + 1 = 35\).

The final answer is:
\[

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a rhombus \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the coordinates of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be expressed as \((a, b)\), \((-a, b)\), \((-a, -b)\), and \((a, -b)\) respectively. The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2b\), so \(BD^2 = 4b^2\).

Since the points \((a, b)\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1.
\]
We can solve for \(b^2\) in terms of \(a^2\):
\[
\frac{b^2}{24} = \frac{a^2}{20} - 1 \implies b^2 = 24\left(\frac{a^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24a^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6a^2}{5} - 24.
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4b^2 = 4\left(\frac{6a^2}{5} - 24\right) = \frac{24a^2}{5} - 96\).

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to determine the range of \(a^2\). Since \(a^2\) can be any non-negative real number, the expression \(\frac{24a^2}{5} - 96\) can take any value greater than or equal to \(-96\) (when \(a^2 = 0\)). Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is not bounded above, but the smallest value it can take is \(-96\). However, we are asked to find the largest number real that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombuses. This number is \(-96\).

Thus, the answer is:

\boxed{-96}.

"To solve this problem, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's define the following sets:
- \( A \) is the set of residents who own a diamond ring.
- \( B \) is the set of residents who own a game of golf.
- \( C \) is the set of residents who own a spade deck.
- \( D \) is the set of residents who own a caramela heart bag.

We are given the following information:
- \( |A| = 195 \)
- \( |B| = 367 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- \( |D| = 900 \)
- The number of residents who own exactly two of these things is 437.
- The number of residents who own exactly three of these things is 234.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four things, denoted as \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

First, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

We know that the total number of residents is 900, so:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900
\]

Next, we need to express the sums of the intersections in terms of the given information. Let:
- \( x_2 \) be the number of residents who own exactly two of the things.
- \( x_3 \) be the number of residents who own exactly three of the things.
- \( x_4 \) be the number of residents who own all four things.

From the problem, we have:
\[
x_2 = 437
\]
\[
x_3 = 234
\]

The sum of the intersections of two sets can be expressed as:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = \binom{2}{2}x_2 + \binom{3}{2}x_3 + \binom{4}{2}x_4
\]
\[
= 1 \cdot 437 + 3 \cdot 234 + 6 \cdot x_4
\]
\[
= 437 + 702 + 6x_4
\]
\[
= 1139 + 6x_4
\]

The sum of the intersections of three sets can be expressed as:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = \binom{3}{3}x_3 + \binom{4}{3}x_4
\]
\[
= 1 \cdot 234 + 4 \cdot x_4
\]
\[
= 234 + 4x_4
\]

Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (1139 + 6x_4) + (234 + 4x_4) - x_4
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
900 = 2024 - 1139 - 6x_4 + 234 + 4x_4 - x_4

\[
900 = 1119 - 3x_4

Solve for \( x_4 \):
\[
3x_4 = 1119 - 900
\]
\[
3x_4 = 219

\[
x_4 = \frac{219}{3}

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \) such that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \), we need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall that the distance \( d \) between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( d = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OIA = 90^\circ \). In a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R \), and the length of the leg \( OI \) is \( d \). The length of the other leg \( IA \) is the inradius \( r \). Therefore, we have:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + r^2
\]
\[
169 = 13 + r^2
\]
\[
r^2 = 156
\]
However, we already know that \( r = 6 \), so this step confirms our values are consistent.

Next, we use the formula for the area \( \Delta \) of triangle \( ABC \) in terms of its circumradius \( R \) and its sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
We also know that the area \( \Delta \) can be expressed in terms of the inradius \( r \) and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
\frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we have:
\[
\frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} = 6s
\]
\[
\frac{abc}{52} = 6s
\]
\[
abc = 312s
\]

We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \), which is \( bc \). To do this, we use the identity for the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
We also use the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), which implies that \( \triangle OIA \) is a right triangle. The length of \( AI \) can be found using the formula:
\[
AI^2 = R(R - 2r \cos A)
\]
Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( \angle OAI = 90^\circ - \angle OIA \), and \( \cos A = \cos(90^\circ - \angle OAI) = \sin \angle OAI \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of \( \triangle OIA \) can also be expressed as:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle OIA = \frac{1}{2} \cdot OI \cdot IA = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{13} \cdot 6 = 3\sqrt{13}
\]
The area of \( \triangle OIA \) can also be expressed as:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle OIA = \frac{1}{2} \cdot OA \cdot AI \sin \angle OAI = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 13 \cdot \frac{bc}{2R} \sin A = \frac{13bc \sin A}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
3\sqrt{13} = \frac{13bc \sin A}{4 \cdot 13}
\]
\[
3\sqrt{13} = \frac{bc \sin A}{4}
\]
\[
bc \sin A = 12\sqrt{13}
\]
Using the identity \( \sin A = \frac{a}{2R} \), we have:
\[
bc \cdot \frac{a}{2R} = 12\sqrt{13}
\]
\[
bc \cdot \frac{a}{2 \cdot 13} = 12\sqrt{13}
\]
\[
bc \cdot \frac{a}{26} = 12\sqrt{13}
\]
\[
bc \cdot a = 312\sqrt{13}
\]
Since \( abc = 312s \), we have:
\[
bc \cdot a = 312 \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
\[
bc \cdot a = 156(a + b + c)
\]
Equating the two expressions for \( abc \), we get:
\[
312\sqrt{13} = 156(a + b + c)
\]
\[
a + b + c = 2\sqrt{13}
\]
However, this step is not necessary to find \( bc \). We already have:
\[
bc = \frac{312s}{a}
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), we have:
\[
bc = \frac{312 \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2}}{a}
\]
\[
bc = \frac{312 \cdot 2\sqrt{13}}{2}
\]
\[
bc = 312\sqrt{13}

"To solve for the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.
\]

We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy both \(a + b + c = 300\) and the equation above. Let's consider the case where two of the variables are equal. Without loss of generality, assume \(a = b\). Then the equations become:

\[
2a + c = 300 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2c + 2a^2c = 3a^2c = 100(a^2 + ac + ac) - 2,000,000.
\]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[
3a^2c = 100a^2 + 200ac - 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
3a^2c - 200ac - 100a^2 + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(a\), we get:

\[
a(3ac - 200c - 100a) + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

Since \(a\) and \(c\) are non-negative integers, let's test some possible values for \(a\). If \(a = 0\), then \(c = 300\) and the equation \(0 = -2,000,000\) is not satisfied. Therefore, \(a \neq 0\).

If \(a = 100\), then \(c = 100\) and \(b = 100\). Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:

\[
100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 3 \cdot 100^3 = 3 \cdot 1,000,000 = 3,000,000,
\]

which is not equal to \(6,000,000\). Therefore, \(a \neq 100\).

If \(a = 200\), then \(c = 100\) and \(b = 0\). Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:

\[
200^2 \cdot 100 + 200^2 \cdot 0 + 0^2 \cdot 100 = 200^2 \cdot 100 = 4 \cdot 10,000 \cdot 100 = 4,000,000,
\]

which is not equal to \(6,000,000\). Therefore, \(a \neq 200\).

If \(a = 150\), then \(c = 0\) and \(b = 150\). Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:

\[
150^2 \cdot 0 + 150^2 \cdot 150 + 0^2 \cdot 150 = 150^3 = 3,375,000,
\]

which is not equal to \(6,000,000\). Therefore, \(a \neq 150\).

If \(a = 100\), then \(c = 100\) and \(b = 100\). Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:

\[
100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 3 \cdot 100^3 = 3 \cdot 1,000,000 = 3,000,000,
\]

which is not equal to \(6,000,000\). Therefore, \(a \neq 100\).

If \(a = 100\), then \(c = 100\) and \(b = 100\). Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:

\[
100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 3 \cdot 100^3 = 3 \cdot 1,000,000 = 3,000,000,
\]

which is not equal to \(6,000,000\). Therefore, \(a \neq 100\).

Therefore, the only solution is \((a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100)\). Since the equation is symmetric, the solutions \((100, 100, 100)\), \((100, 100, 100)\), and \((100, 100, 100)\) are the only solutions. Therefore, the number of solutions is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not belong to any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of the family \(\mathcal{F}\), where \(P\) is on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) is on the \(y\)-axis, and the length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1.

First, let's parameterize the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The equation of the line passing through these points can be written as:
\[

Let \(C\) be a point on this line with coordinates \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) is on \(\overline{AB}\), we have:

We need to find \(C\) such that there do not exist points \(P = (a, 0)\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q = (0, b)\) on the \(y\)-axis such that the distance \(PQ\) is 1. The distance \(PQ\) is given by:
\[
PQ = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 1

Since \(C\) is on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), we can express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). The coordinates of \(C\) are \((x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). We need to find \(x\) such that there do not exist \(a\) and \(b\) satisfying both \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and the line equation.

To find \(C\), we need to consider the geometric properties of the problem. The point \(C\) must be such that the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) cannot reach \(C\) without intersecting the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) at a point other than \(C\). This happens when \(C\) is the point where the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is tangent to the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.

The equation of the circle is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1

Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the circle's equation, we get:
\[
x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1

\[
4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1

Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fraction:
\[
16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4

\[
16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\):

x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32}
\]
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32}

\[
x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Since \(C\) is in the first quadrant, we take the positive root:
\[
x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\) back into the equation of the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\):
\[
y = -\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
y = -\frac{3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
\[
y = \frac{-3\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39} + 4\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]
Now, we need to find \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = x^2 + y^2
\]
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2
\]
\[
OC^2 = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{13})^2}{64} + \frac{(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2}{64}
\]
\[
OC^2 = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{13} + 13 + 3 - 2\sqrt{117} + 39}{64}
\]
\[
OC^2 = \frac{64}{64}

\[
OC^2 = 1

"Given that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) has roots \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to find the residue of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) when divided by 1000.

First, observe that the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) can be factored as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).\]
We can also consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{13} - 1\) in the form:
\[Q(x) = (x^2 - 2x + 1)(x^{11} + x^{10} + \cdots + x + 1) = (x-1)^2(x^{11} + x^{10} + \cdots + x + 1).\]
However, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that:
\[2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k} = 2(1-\omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.\]
We can rewrite the product as:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left(2(1-\omega^k) + \omega^{2k}\right).\]
To simplify this, consider the polynomial \(R(x) = x^{13} - 1\) and substitute \(x = \omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial \(R(x)\) can be written as:
\[R(x) = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).\]
We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}).\]
Notice that:
\[2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 1 + 1 = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1.\]
Thus, the product becomes:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1).\]
We can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be written as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).\]
By substituting \(x = \omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\), we get:
\[\omega^{13} - 1 = 0 \implies \omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0.\]
This implies that:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1.\]
By substituting \(x = 2\) in the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\), we get:
\[2^{12} + 2^{11} + \cdots + 2 + 1 = 2^{13} - 1 = 8191.\]
Thus, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) = 8191.\]
Finally, we need to find the residue of 8191 when divided by 1000:

"To determine the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-elegant numbers, we start by expressing a two-digit number \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) such that \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). According to the problem, the sum of the digits \( a \) and \( c \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \). Therefore, we have:

\[
a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}
\]

Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:

\[
(a + c)^2 = ab + c
\]

Expanding and rearranging terms, we obtain:

\[
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \implies a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0
\]

Rearranging further, we get a quadratic equation in \( c \):

\[
c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0
\]

This is a standard quadratic equation of the form \( c^2 + Bc + C = 0 \), where \( B = 2a - 1 \) and \( C = a^2 - ab \). The solutions for \( c \) are given by the quadratic formula:

\[
c = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4C}}{2} = \frac{-(2a-1) \pm \sqrt{(2a-1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab)}}{2}
\]

Simplifying inside the square root, we get:

\[
(2a-1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 = 4a(b-1) + 1
\]

Thus, the solutions for \( c \) are:

\[
c = \frac{-(2a-1) \pm \sqrt{4a(b-1) + 1}}{2}
\]

For \( c \) to be an integer, \( \sqrt{4a(b-1) + 1} \) must be an odd integer. Let \( \sqrt{4a(b-1) + 1} = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Then:

\[
4a(b-1) + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \implies 4a(b-1) = 4k^2 + 4k \implies a(b-1) = k^2 + k
\]

This means \( k^2 + k \) must be divisible by \( a \). The possible values for \( k \) are such that \( k(k+1) \) is divisible by \( a \). Since \( k \) and \( k+1 \) are consecutive integers, one of them is even, so \( k(k+1) \) is always even. Therefore, \( a \) must be a divisor of \( k(k+1) \).

For each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \), we need to find the number of valid \( k \) such that \( k(k+1) \) is divisible by \( a \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The value of \( c \) is:

\[
c = \frac{-(2a-1) + (2k+1)}{2} = k - a + 1
\]

For \( c \) to be a valid digit, we need \( 0 \le k - a + 1 < b \), which simplifies to \( a-1 \le k < b+a-1 \). The number of integers \( k \) in this range is \( b-1 \).

We need to count the number of divisors of \( k(k+1) \) for each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \). The number of \( b \)-elegant numbers is the sum of the number of divisors of \( k(k+1) \) for each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \).

We need to find the smallest \( b \) such that this sum is greater than 10. Let's check the values of \( b \) starting from 2:

- For \( b = 2 \): \( a = 1 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \). The divisors of \( k(k+1) \) are 1 and 2, so there are 2 \( 2 \)-elegant numbers.
- For \( b = 3 \): \( a = 1, 2 \). For \( a = 1 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 1 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 2 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 2 \)-elegant numbers. Total: 4 \( 3 \)-elegant numbers.
- For \( b = 4 \): \( a = 1, 2, 3 \). For \( a = 1 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 1 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 2 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 2 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 3 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 3 \)-elegant numbers. Total: 6 \( 4 \)-elegant numbers.
- For \( b = 5 \): \( a = 1, 2, 3, 4 \). For \( a = 1 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 1 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 2 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 2 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 3 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 3 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 4 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 4 \)-elegant numbers. Total: 8 \( 5 \)-elegant numbers.
- For \( b = 6 \): \( a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \). For \( a = 1 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 1 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 2 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 2 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 3 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 4 \( 3 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 4 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 4 \)-elegant numbers. For \( a = 5 \), \( k(k+1) = k(k+1) \), so there are 2 \( 5 \)-elegant numbers. Total: 12 \( 6 \)-elegant numbers.

Therefore, the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-elegant numbers is:

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible combinations of its vertices.

A rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be parallel in several ways. Specifically, we need to count the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides from the dodecagon.

First, let's identify the different types of parallel sides in a regular dodecagon:
1. **Next-to-each other sides**: There are 12 such pairs (one for each side of the dodecagon).
2. **Sides with one vertex between them**: There are 12 such pairs (one for each pair of vertices with one vertex between them).
3. **Sides with two vertices between them**: There are 12 such pairs (one for each pair of vertices with two vertices between them).
4. **Sides with three vertices between them**: There are 12 such pairs (one for each pair of vertices with three vertices between them).
5. **Sides with four vertices between them**: There are 6 such pairs (one for each pair of vertices with four vertices between them).
6. **Sides with five vertices between them**: There are 6 such pairs (one for each pair of vertices with five vertices between them).

Next, we need to count the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides from these sets. We can do this by considering each type of pair and calculating the number of ways to choose two pairs from that type.

1. **Next-to-each other sides**: There are 12 pairs, and we need to choose 2 out of these 12. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2 \times 1} = 66
   \]

2. **Sides with one vertex between them**: There are 12 pairs, and we need to choose 2 out of these 12. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2 \times 1} = 66
   \]

3. **Sides with two vertices between them**: There are 12 pairs, and we need to choose 2 out of these 12. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2 \times 1} = 66
   \]

4. **Sides with three vertices between them**: There are 12 pairs, and we need to choose 2 out of these 12. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2 \times 1} = 66
   \]

5. **Sides with four vertices between them**: There are 6 pairs, and we need to choose 2 out of these 6. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

6. **Sides with five vertices between them**: There are 6 pairs, and we need to choose 2 out of these 6. The number of ways to do this is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

Now, we sum the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides from each type:
\[
66 + 66 + 66 + 66 + 15 + 15 = 288
\]

Therefore, the total number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon is:

"Dado un listado de números enteros正ativos con las following properties:
1. La sum of the elements in the list is 30.
2. The only mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is an integer positive number that does not appear in the list.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the elements in the list.

First, let's denote the list in ascending order as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\). Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's assume that 9 appears \(k\) times. The median of the list is the middle number if \(n\) is odd, or the average of the two middle numbers if \(n\) is even. Since the median is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(n\) must be even. Let \(n = 2m\). The median is then \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\).

Since 9 is the mode, \(k \geq 2\). If \(k = 2\), then the list would be \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, a_5, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median would be \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. However, if \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) are different from 9, then 9 cannot be the mode, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, \(k \geq 3\).

Let's consider the case \(k = 3\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, a_6, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_6 + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_6 + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30 - 27 = 3\). Since \(a_1, a_2, a_6, \ldots, a_{2m}\) are positive integers, the only possible values are \(a_1 = a_2 = 1\) and \(a_6 = a_7 = \ldots = a_{2m} = 1\). However, this would make the median 1, which is not an integer that does not appear in the list. Therefore, \(k \geq 4\).

Let's consider the case \(k = 4\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_7, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_7 + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_7 + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30 - 36 = -6\), which is not possible. Therefore, \(k \geq 5\).

Let's consider the case \(k = 5\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_8, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30 - 45 = -15\), which is not possible. Therefore, \(k \geq 6\).

Let's consider the case \(k = 6\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_{10}, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_{10} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_{10} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30 - 54 = -24\), which is not possible. Therefore, \(k \geq 7\).

Let's consider the case \(k = 7\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_{12}, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30 - 63 = -33\), which is not possible. Therefore, \(k \geq 8\).

Let's consider the case \(k = 8\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_{12}, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30 - 72 = -42\), which is not possible. Therefore, \(k \geq 9\).

Let's consider the case \(k = 9\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_{12}, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30 - 81 = -51\), which is not possible. Therefore, \(k \geq 10\).

Let's consider the case \(k = 10\). The list can be written as \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_{12}, \ldots, a_{2m}\). The median is \(\frac{a_m + a_{m+1}}{2}\), and since it is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_m\) and \(a_{m+1}\) must be different from 9. The sum of the elements is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_{12} + \ldots + a_{2m} = 30 - 90 = -60\), which is not possible. Therefore, \(k \geq 11\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading from left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading from top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
The two numbers formed by reading from left to right are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:
\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
\]
The three numbers formed by reading from top to bottom are \(100a + 10d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:
\[
100a + 10d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
\]
We now have the following system of equations:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(100a + 10d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\)

To eliminate some variables, we subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (100a + 10d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
90d + 9e - 9c = 900
\]
Dividing through by 9, we obtain:
\[
10d + e - c = 100
\]
This equation tells us that \(c = 10d + e - 100\). Since \(c\) is a digit (i.e., \(0 \leq c \leq 9\)), it follows that:
\[
0 \leq 10d + e - 100 \leq 9
\]
Adding 100 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[
100 \leq 10d + e \leq 109
\]
Since \(d\) and \(e\) are digits (i.e., \(0 \leq d, e \leq 9\)), the only possible value for \(10d + e\) is 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, or 109. However, the only value that satisfies \(10d + e = 100\) is \(d = 1\) and \(e = 0\). Therefore, \(c = 10(1) + 0 - 100 = 0\).

Now we substitute \(d = 1\), \(e = 0\), and \(c = 0\) back into the original equations. The first equation becomes:
\[
100a + 10b + 0 + 100(1) + 10(0) + f = 999
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
100a + 10b + 100 + f = 999
\]
Subtracting 100 from both sides, we obtain:
\[
100a + 10b + f = 899
\]
The second equation becomes:
\[
100a + 10(1) + 10b + 0 + 10(0) + f = 99
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
100a + 10 + 10b + f = 99
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we obtain:
\[
100a + 10b + f = 89
\]
We now have the system:
1. \(100a + 10b + f = 899\)
2. \(100a + 10b + f = 89\)

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in exponential form. The first equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(yz\), we get:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz
\]

The second equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(xz\), we get:

\[
y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz
\]

The third equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(xy\), we get:

\[
z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz\)
2. \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\)
3. \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\)

We can substitute the expressions for \(y\) and \(z\) from the second and third equations into the first equation. First, substitute \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\) into the first equation:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot (2^{1/3} \cdot xz) \cdot z = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot xz^2
\]

Divide both sides by \(x\) (since \(x \neq 0\)):

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot z^2
\]

Recall that \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
1 = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot z^2 = 2^{1/2 + 1/3} \cdot z^2 = 2^{5/6} \cdot z^2
\]

Divide both sides by \(2^{5/6}\):

\[
z^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

Next, substitute \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into the second equation:

\[
y = 2^{1/3} \cdot x \cdot 2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/3 - 5/12} \cdot x = 2^{4/12 - 5/12} \cdot x = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x
\]

So, we have:

\[
y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x
\]

Finally, substitute \(y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into the third equation:

\[
z = 2^{1/4} \cdot x \cdot (2^{-1/12} \cdot x) = 2^{1/4} \cdot 2^{-1/12} \cdot x^2 = 2^{1/4 - 1/12} \cdot x^2 = 2^{3/12 - 1/12} \cdot x^2 = 2^{2/12} \cdot x^2 = 2^{1/6} \cdot x^2
\]

Since we already know that \(z = 2^{-5/12}\), we can set the two expressions for \(z\) equal to each other:

\[
2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/6} \cdot x^2
\]

Recall that \(2^{1/6} = 2^{2/12}\), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2^{-5/12} = 2^{2/12} \cdot x^2
\]

Divide both sides by \(2^{2/12}\):

\[
2^{-5/12 - 2/12} = x^2 \implies 2^{-7/12} = x^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
x = 2^{-7/24}
\]

Now we have \(x = 2^{-7/24}\), \(y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x = 2^{-1/12} \cdot 2^{-7/24} = 2^{-2/24 - 7/24} = 2^{-9/24} = 2^{-3/8}\), and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).

We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4y^3z^2 = (2^{-7/24})^4 \cdot (2^{-3/8})^3 \cdot (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6}
\]

To add the exponents, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24, so we rewrite the exponents with a denominator of 24:

\[
-7/6 = -28/24, \quad -9/8 = -27/24, \quad -5/6 = -20/24
\]

Adding these exponents together, we get:

\[
-28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

The absolute value is:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

So, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), and \(m+n = 25+8 = 33\). The final answer is:

"Given a hexagon \(ABCDEF\) where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, we can consider it as a combination of two congruent trapezoids or a parallelogram with a smaller parallelogram inside it. The triangle formed by the extensions of the segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the length of the side of the hexagon.

First, let's denote the side length of the hexagon as \(s\). Since the hexagon is equilateral and all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, we can use the properties of similar triangles. The triangle formed by the extensions of \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) is similar to a triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon, but scaled up by a factor of 2 (because each side of the hexagon is extended to form the sides of the larger triangle).

To see why, consider the following:
- The segment \(AB\) is extended to form one side of the larger triangle.
- The segment \(CD\) is parallel to \(AB\) and is extended to form another side of the larger triangle.
- The segment \(EF\) is parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\) and is extended to form the third side of the larger triangle.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the distance between each pair of parallel sides is the same. Therefore, the larger triangle is a scaled-up version of the hexagon, with each side of the hexagon being half the length of the corresponding side of the larger triangle.

Given the side lengths of the larger triangle are 200, 240, and 300, we can find the side length of the hexagon by dividing each of these lengths by 2:
\[
s = \frac{200}{2} = 100
\]
\[
s = \frac{240}{2} = 120
\]
\[
s = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

However, this approach seems to have an error because we should have a consistent side length for all sides of the hexagon. Let's re-evaluate the problem using a different approach.

Given the properties of the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions, we can use the fact that the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to a triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon, but scaled up by a factor of 2. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon should be the average of the side lengths of the larger triangle divided by 2.

\[
s = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{2} = \frac{740}{2} = 120
\]

Thus, the correct approach is to use the properties of the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions to find the side length of the hexagon.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the set \( A \) such that the number of non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \) is 2024. Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the number of subsets \( B \) where \( a_i \) is the maximum element is the number of subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1\} \). This is because any subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1\} \) can be combined with \( a_i \) to form a valid subset \( B \). The number of subsets of a set with \( a_i-1 \) elements is \( 2^{a_i-1} \).

Therefore, the total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets for each element in \( A \):
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

We need to find a set of integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that the sum of the powers of 2 equals 2024. First, we convert 2024 to its binary representation:
\[
2024_{10} = 11111100010_2
\]

The binary representation \( 11111100010_2 \) can be interpreted as:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^1
\]

This means that the set \( A \) consists of the integers \( 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 2 \). To find the sum of the elements of \( A \), we add these integers together:
\[
11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 2 = 51

"Given a four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits by 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we need to find the value of \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) and \( R \) are the quotient and remainder, respectively, when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

First, let's express \( N \) in terms of its digits:
\[ N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \]
where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are digits and \( a \neq 0 \) since \( N \) is a four-digit number.

### Condition Analysis
For \( N \) to satisfy the given condition, changing any one digit by 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. This gives us four congruences:
1. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + (d+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + (d-1) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + (c+1) + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + (c-1) + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
5. \( 1000a + (b+1) + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
6. \( 1000a + (b-1) + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
7. \( (a+1) + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
8. \( (a-1) + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

### Simplifying the Congruences
We start by simplifying each congruence modulo 7:
1. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

2. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

3. \( 1000a + 100b + (c+1) + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

4. \( 1000a + 100b + (c-1) + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c - 1 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

5. \( 1000a + (b+1) + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

6. \( 1000a + (b-1) + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c - 1 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

7. \( (a+1) + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

8. \( (a-1) + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c - 1 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

From these congruences, we see that \( 6a + 2b + 3c + d \) must be congruent to both 6 and 1 modulo 7, which is impossible unless \( N \) is a specific number that satisfies all conditions.

### Finding \( N \)
By trial and error or systematic checking, we find that \( N = 9999 \) satisfies all conditions:
- \( 9999 \div 7 = 1428 \) remainder \( 3 \)
- \( 9998 \div 7 = 1428 \) remainder \( 2 \)
- \( 9990 \div 7 = 1427 \) remainder \( 1 \)
- \( 9998 \div 7 = 1428 \) remainder \( 2 \)
- \( 9990 \div 7 = 1427 \) remainder \( 1 \)
- \( 9990 \div 7 = 1427 \) remainder \( 1 \)
- \( 9999 \div 7 = 1428 \) remainder \( 3 \)
- \( 9999 \div 7 = 1428 \) remainder \( 3 \)

Thus, \( N = 9999 \).

### Final Calculation
\[ Q = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1000} \right\rfloor = 9 \]
\[ R = 9999 \mod 1000 = 999 \]
\[ Q + R = 9 + 999 = 1008 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it descends in the exterior of \( S \) and when it descends in the interior of \( S \), respectively. The difference \( r_i - r_o \) can then be expressed as \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers, and we need to find \( m+n \).

First, let's analyze the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The distance from the center of the torus to any point on the surface of the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units ( outer radius) or \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units (inner radius).

When the torus descends in the exterior of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 6 + 6 = 12 \) units. The radius of the sphere is 11 units. The radius \( r_i \) of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency on the torus, which is the same as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the inner radius of the torus:
\[
r_i = 12 - 3 = 9
\]

When the torus descends in the interior of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 6 - 6 = 0 \) units. The radius of the sphere is 11 units. The radius \( r_o \) of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is the same as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus plus the outer radius of the torus:
\[
r_o = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 9 - 8 = 1
\]

Since 1 is already in its simplest form, we have \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m+n = 1+1 = 2 \).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the possible configurations:**
   - Each row can either contain all white chips or all black chips.
   - Each column can either contain all white chips or all black chips.

2. **Count the number of valid configurations:**
   - We need to count the number of ways to assign colors to the rows and columns such that the conditions are satisfied.

3. **Consider the constraints:**
   - If a row is all white, then all columns must be all white.
   - If a row is all black, then all columns must be all black.
   - Similarly, if a column is all white, then all rows must be all white.
   - If a column is all black, then all rows must be all black.

4. **Analyze the possible scenarios:**
   - There are two scenarios where all rows and columns are the same color:
     - All rows and columns are all white.
     - All rows and columns are all black.

5. **Check if any additional chips can be placed:**
   - In the scenario where all rows and columns are all white, no additional white chips can be placed without violating the condition that each row and each column must have the same color.
   - Similarly, in the scenario where all rows and columns are all black, no additional black chips can be placed without violating the condition that each row and each column must have the same color.
