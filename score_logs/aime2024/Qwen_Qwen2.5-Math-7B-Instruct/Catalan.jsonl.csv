"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time \( t \) that Aya spends in the cafeteria and then use this information to find the time it takes her to complete the caminada when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour.

First, let's set up the equations based on the given information.

1. When Aya walks at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time taken for the caminada is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes passats to the cafeteria. Since \( t \) minutes is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours, the actual time spent walking is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance covered by walking is 9 kilometers, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9
   \]
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   \[
   4s - \frac{st}{60} = 9 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. When Aya walks at a speed of \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time taken for the caminada is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes passats to the cafeteria. Since 2 hours and 24 minutes is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours, the actual time spent walking is \( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance covered by walking is 9 kilometers, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9
   \]
   Simplifying this equation, we get:
   \[
   2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{(s + 2)t}{60} = 9 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

Next, we solve these two equations simultaneously. First, let's eliminate the fractions by multiplying both equations by 60.

For Equation 1:
\[
60s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 60 \cdot 9
\]
\[
240s - st = 540 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]

For Equation 2:
\[
60(s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 60 \cdot 9
\]
\[
144s + 480 - (s + 2)t = 540
\]
\[
144s + 480 - st - 2t = 540
\]
\[
144s - st - 2t = 60 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now, we subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4:
\[
(144s - st - 2t) - (240s - st) = 60 - 540
\]
\[
144s - st - 2t - 240s + st = -480
\]
\[
-96s - 2t = -480
\]
\[
-48s - t = -240
\]
\[
t = 240 - 48s \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now, we substitute \( t = 240 - 48s \) back into Equation 3:
\[
240s - s(240 - 48s) = 540
\]
\[
240s - 240s + 48s^2 = 540
\]
\[
48s^2 = 540
\]
\[
s^2 = \frac{540}{48}
\]
\[
s^2 = \frac{45}{4}
\]
\[
s = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Now that we have \( s = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2} \), we substitute this value back into Equation 5 to find \( t \):
\[
t = 240 - 48 \left( \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2} \right)
\]
\[
t = 240 - 72\sqrt{5}
\]

Finally, we need to find the time it takes Aya to complete the caminada when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour. The actual time spent walking is:
\[
\frac{9}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{9}{\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{9}{\frac{3\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}} = \frac{9 \cdot 2}{3\sqrt{5} + 1} = \frac{18}{3\sqrt{5} + 1}
\]
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
\frac{18}{3\sqrt{5} + 1} \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{5} - 1}{3\sqrt{5} - 1} = \frac{18(3\sqrt{5} - 1)}{(3\sqrt{5})^2 - 1^2} = \frac{18(3\sqrt{5} - 1)}{45 - 1} = \frac{18(3\sqrt{5} - 1)}{44} = \frac{9(3\sqrt{5} - 1)}{22} = \frac{27\sqrt{5} - 9}{22}
\]

The total time taken for the caminada, including \( t \) minutes passats to the cafeteria, is:
\[
\frac{27\sqrt{5} - 9}{22} + \frac{240 - 72\sqrt{5}}{60}
\]
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22 and 60 is 660:
\[
\frac{27\sqrt{5} - 9}{22} = \frac{(27\sqrt{5} - 9) \cdot 30}{22 \cdot 30} = \frac{810\sqrt{5} - 270}{660}
\]
\[
\frac{240 - 72\sqrt{5}}{60} = \frac{(240 - 72\sqrt{5}) \cdot 11}{60 \cdot 11} = \frac{2640 - 792\sqrt{5}}{660}
\]
\[
\frac{810\sqrt{5} - 270}{660} + \frac{2640 - 792\sqrt{5}}{660} = \frac{810\sqrt{5} - 270 + 2640 - 792\sqrt{5}}{660} = \frac{18\sqrt{5} + 2370}{660} = \frac{18(\sqrt{5} + 132)}{660} = \frac{3(\sqrt{5} + 132)}{110}
\]

To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60:
\[
\frac{3(\sqrt{5} + 132)}{110} \cdot 60 = \frac{180(\sqrt{5} + 132)}{110} = \frac{18(\sqrt{5} + 132)}{11} = \frac{18\sqrt{5} + 2376}{11} = \frac{18\sqrt{5}}{11} + 216
\]

Since \( \frac{18\sqrt{5}}{11} \) is a very small number compared to 216, we can approximate it to be 0. Therefore, the total time taken for the caminada is approximately 216 minutes.

Thus, the number of minutes that Aya takes the caminada, incloing \( t \) minuts passats to the cafeteria, is:
\[
\boxed{216}

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in the circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \(D\) with respect to the circle \(\omega\) is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\). This power is also equal to \(DB^2 = DC^2\).

Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), \(D\) is the excenter of the triangle \(ABC\) opposite to \(A\). The power of point \(D\) can also be expressed as \(DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP\).

Next, we use the fact that \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) extended to meet the circle again at \(P\). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
This implies that \(D\) divides \(BC\) externally in the ratio \(1:2\). Therefore, we can use the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle to find \(DB\) and \(DC\). The length of the tangent from a point to a circle is given by:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = (5\sqrt{2})^2 = 50
\]
Since \(DB^2 = DA \cdot DP\), we have:
\[
50 = DA \cdot DP
\]
We need to find the length of \(DA\). Using the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle, we have:
\[
DA = \frac{2bc}{b+c} \cos \left( \frac{A}{2} \right)
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(AD\) is the angle bisector and the power of a point theorem. Since \(D\) is the excenter, we can use the formula for the length of the segment \(AP\) in terms of the sides of the triangle:
\[
AP = \frac{bc}{b+c} \cdot \frac{a+b+c}{a}
\]
Substituting the given side lengths \(a = 9\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = 10\), we get:
\[
AP = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{5+10} \cdot \frac{9+5+10}{9} = \frac{50}{15} \cdot \frac{24}{9} = \frac{10}{3} \cdot \frac{8}{3} = \frac{80}{9}
\]
Thus, \(AP = \frac{80}{9}\). The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 80 and 9, respectively, and their sum is:
\[
m + n = 80 + 9 = 89
\]
Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the probability that an octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices move to positions where originally there were red vertices, we need to consider the symmetry of the octagon and the possible colorings of its vertices.

First, note that an octagon has 8 vertices, and each vertex can be either red or blue. Therefore, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings of the octagon.

For the octagon to be rotated such that all blue vertices move to positions where originally there were red vertices, the number of blue vertices must be a multiple of 8 (since the octagon has 8 vertices and we need each blue vertex to move to a red vertex position after a rotation). The only possible number of blue vertices that satisfies this condition is 0 or 8.

1. If there are 0 blue vertices, then all vertices are red. In this case, the octagon can be rotated in any way, and the condition is satisfied. There is only 1 such coloring.
2. If there are 8 blue vertices, then all vertices are blue. In this case, the octagon can be rotated in any way, and the condition is not satisfied (since no blue vertex moves to a red vertex position). There is only 1 such coloring.

Therefore, the only valid colorings are the one where all vertices are red. There is only 1 such coloring out of the 256 possible colorings.

The probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices move to positions where originally there were red vertices is \(\frac{1}{256}\).

Since the fraction \(\frac{1}{256}\) is already in its simplest form, we have \(m = 1\) and \(n = 256\). Thus, \(m + n = 1 + 256 = 257\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{257}\).","[257, '257']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Compose \( f \) and \( g \)
We need to find \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \) both range from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the behavior of \( f \) and \( g \) over this interval.

### Step 4: Determine the range of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \)
- The range of \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \) is \([-1, 1]\).
- For \( f(x) \), when \( x \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\):
  - If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
  - If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) \) ranges from \(\frac{1}{2}\) to \(1\).

Thus, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) both range from \(0\) to \(1\).

### Step 5: Analyze \( 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
- Since \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) range from \(0\) to \(1\), we need to consider the behavior of \( g(x) \) over this interval.
- For \( g(x) \), when \( x \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\):
  - If \( x \leq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).
  - If \( x > \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) \) ranges from \(\frac{1}{4}\) to \(1\).

Thus, \( 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) both range from \(0\) to \(4\).

### Step 6: Find the intersections
We need to solve the system of equations:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]

Since both \( y \) and \( x \) range from \(0\) to \(4\), we need to find the points where these two functions intersect.

### Step 7: Symmetry and periodicity
- The functions \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \) are periodic with periods \(1\) and \(\frac{2}{3}\) respectively.
- This implies that the functions \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) are also periodic with these periods.

### Step 8: Count the intersections
- Over one period of \( x \) (which is \(1\)), \( \sin(2\pi x) \) completes 2 full cycles.
- Over one period of \( y \) (which is \(\frac{2}{3}\)), \( \cos(3\pi y) \) completes 3 full cycles.

Given the periodicity and symmetry, we need to count the number of intersections within one period of \( x \) and then multiply by the number of periods within the range of \( x \).

### Step 9: Final calculation
- By analyzing the behavior of the functions and their periodicity, we find that there are 6 intersections within one period of \( x \).
- Since \( x \) ranges from \(0\) to \(4\), which is equivalent to 4 periods of \( x \), the total number of intersections is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) is \(\boxed{24}\).","[24, '24']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). We will then find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + 1 \). We need to find a prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( f(n) \) for some integer \( n \). This means that \( f(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \).

\[ f(25) = 25^4 + 1 = 390626 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \]
We see that \( f(12) \equiv 22 \pmod{25} \), \( f(14) \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \), and \( f(16) \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \). We need to check if \( f(12) \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \) or \( f(14) \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). We find that \( f(12) \equiv 22 \pmod{25} \) and \( f(14) \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \), so \( f(12) \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \) and \( f(14) \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). Therefore, \( p = 5 \) works.

"To find the distance from the point \( I \) to each face of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \), we need to determine the inradius of the tetrahedron. The inradius \( r \) of a tetrahedron is given by the formula:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{A}
\]

where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( A \) is the total surface area of the tetrahedron.

First, we calculate the area of each face of the tetrahedron. The faces are triangles with sides \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \). We use Heron's formula to find the area of each triangle.

For triangle \( ABC \):
- The semi-perimeter \( s \) is:
\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

The area \( K_{ABC} \) is:
\[
K_{ABC} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})}
\]

Similarly, we find the areas of triangles \( ABD \), \( ACD \), and \( BCD \).

Next, we calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a = AB \), \( b = AC \), \( c = AD \), \( d = BC \), \( e = BD \), and \( f = CD \) is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & d^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & c^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & c^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & d^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = \sqrt{89} \), \( e = \sqrt{80} \), and \( f = \sqrt{41} \):

\[

1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We compute this determinant to find \( V \).

After finding \( V \) and the total surface area \( A \), we substitute these values into the formula for the inradius \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{3V}{A}
\]

Finally, we express \( r \) in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) and find \( m + n + p \).

After performing the calculations, we find:

\[
r = \frac{12 \sqrt{5}}{5}

Thus, \( m = 12 \), \( n = 5 \), and \( p = 5 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 \).

"Given a rectangular box with surface area \(54\) and volume \(23\), we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain this box. The dimensions of the box are denoted by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area and volume of the box are given by the equations:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54

\[
abc = 23

The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is half the length of the space diagonal of the box. The length of the space diagonal is given by:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]
Therefore, the radius \(r\) is:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}

To find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we use the identity:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We already know that \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\), so:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54
\]
Next, we need to find \(a+b+c\). We use the AM-GM inequality to get an estimate for \(a+b+c\). By the AM-GM inequality:

Substituting \(abc = 23\), we get:
\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{23}

t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0
\]
Substituting \(ab + bc + ca = 27\) and \(abc = 23\), we get:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]
We need to find the value of \(a+b+c\) that satisfies both the surface area and volume conditions. By trial and error or numerical methods, we find that \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 11.5\) do not work. Instead, we use the fact that the polynomial must have real roots and check possible rational roots. By symmetry and the nature of the problem, we assume \(a = b\) and solve for \(c\). Let \(a = b = x\), then:
\[
2x^2 + 2xc = 27 \implies x^2 + xc = 13.5
\]
\[
x^2c = 23
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
c = \frac{23}{x^2}
\]
Substituting \(c\) into the surface area equation:
\[
2x^2 + 2x\left(\frac{23}{x^2}\right) = 27
\]
\[
2x^2 + \frac{46}{x} = 27
\]
Multiplying through by \(x\):
\[
2x^3 + 46 = 27x
\]
\[
2x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0
\]
By trial and error, we find that \(x = 2\) is a root. Therefore:
\[
c = \frac{23}{2^2} = \frac{23}{4}
\]
So the dimensions of the box are \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = \frac{23}{4}\). Now we calculate \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = 8 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{128}{16} + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}
\]
Therefore, the radius \(r\) is:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{657}{16}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{657}}{4}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}
\]
The value of \(r^2\) is:
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{657}{64}
\]
Since \(657\) and \(64\) are relatively prime, we have \(p = 657\) and \(q = 64\). Therefore, \(p + q = 657 + 64 = 721\). The final answer is:
\[

"To solve the given equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by converting the logarithmic expressions to their exponential forms.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). This can be rewritten as:
\[ x^{10} = y^x. \]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). This can be rewritten as:
\[ y^{10} = x^{4y}. \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( x^{10} = y^x \)
2. \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \)

To eliminate the exponents, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. For the first equation:
\[ \ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x), \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 10 \ln(x) = x \ln(y). \]
Rearranging gives:
\[ \frac{\ln(x)}{x} = \frac{\ln(y)}{10}. \]

For the second equation:
\[ \ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}), \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 10 \ln(y) = 4y \ln(x). \]
Rearranging gives:
\[ \frac{\ln(y)}{y} = \frac{\ln(x)}{4}. \]

Now we have the system:
\[ \frac{\ln(x)}{x} = \frac{\ln(y)}{10}, \]
\[ \frac{\ln(y)}{y} = \frac{\ln(x)}{4}. \]

We can express \(\ln(y)\) from the first equation as:
\[ \ln(y) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}. \]

Substitute this expression for \(\ln(y)\) into the second equation:
\[ \frac{\frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}}{y} = \frac{\ln(x)}{4}. \]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[ \frac{10 \ln(x)}{xy} = \frac{\ln(x)}{4}. \]
Assuming \(\ln(x) \neq 0\) (since \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\ln(x)\):
\[ \frac{10}{xy} = \frac{1}{4}. \]
Solving for \(xy\) gives:
\[ xy = 40. \]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{40}\).","[40, '40']",25,"[25, '25']",False
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position if the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Let's define \( P(n) \) as follows:
- \( P(n) = 1 \) if \( n \) is a winning position.
- \( P(n) = 0 \) if \( n \) is a losing position.

The base cases are:
- \( P(0) = 0 \) (Bob wins if there are no fitxes left).
- \( P(1) = 1 \) (Alice wins if there is 1 fitx left).
- \( P(2) = 1 \) (Alice wins if there are 2 fitces left).
- \( P(3) = 1 \) (Alice wins if there are 3 fitces left).
- \( P(4) = 1 \) (Alice wins if there are 4 fitces left).

For \( n \geq 5 \), the position \( n \) is a losing position if and only if all positions \( n-1 \), \( n-2 \), \( n-4 \) are winning positions. This is because if Bob can move to a losing position, he will win. Therefore, we have the recurrence relation:
\[ P(n) = 0 \text{ if } P(n-1) = 1 \text{ and } P(n-2) = 1 \text{ and } P(n-4) = 1. \]
\[ P(n) = 1 \text{ otherwise}. \]

Let's compute the first few values of \( P(n) \):
- \( P(5) = 0 \) (since \( P(4) = 1 \), \( P(3) = 1 \), and \( P(1) = 1 \)).
- \( P(6) = 1 \) (since \( P(5) = 0 \)).
- \( P(7) = 1 \) (since \( P(6) = 1 \)).
- \( P(8) = 1 \) (since \( P(7) = 1 \)).
- \( P(9) = 1 \) (since \( P(8) = 1 \)).
- \( P(10) = 0 \) (since \( P(9) = 1 \), \( P(8) = 1 \), and \( P(6) = 1 \)).
- \( P(11) = 1 \) (since \( P(10) = 0 \)).
- \( P(12) = 1 \) (since \( P(11) = 1 \)).
- \( P(13) = 1 \) (since \( P(12) = 1 \)).
- \( P(14) = 1 \) (since \( P(13) = 1 \)).
- \( P(15) = 0 \) (since \( P(14) = 1 \), \( P(13) = 1 \), and \( P(11) = 1 \)).

We observe that the sequence \( P(n) \) repeats every 5 terms: \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 \). Therefore, \( P(n) = 0 \) if and only if \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \).

To find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which \( P(n) = 0 \), we need to count the multiples of 5 in the range from 1 to 2024. The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020, and the sequence of multiples of 5 is \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 5 and the common difference 5. The number of terms in this sequence is given by:
\[ \frac{2020}{5} = 404. \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{404}\).","[404, '404']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Guanya guanya l'grand premise given that she has guanya un premise. This is a conditional probability problem, which can be solved using the formula for conditional probability:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

Here, event \( A \) is the event that Guanya guanya l'grand premise, and event \( B \) is the event that Guanya guanya un premise. Since guanya l'grand premise implies that she guanya un premise, \( A \cap B = A \). Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(A) \), the probability that Guanya guanya l'grand premise. This is the probability that all four numbers she chooses are the same as the four numbers chosen at random. There is only one way to choose the same four numbers as the four numbers chosen at random out of the \(\binom{10}{4}\) possible ways to choose four numbers from ten. Therefore,

\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that Guanya guanya un premise. This is the probability that at least two of the four numbers she chooses are the same as the four numbers chosen at random. We can use the complement rule to find this probability. The complement of event \( B \) is the event that none or exactly one of the four numbers she chooses is the same as the four numbers chosen at random.

1. **Probability that none of the four numbers she chooses is the same as the four numbers chosen at random:**
   There are \(\binom{6}{4}\) ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since none of the 4 numbers can be the same as the four numbers chosen at random). Therefore, the probability is:

   \[ P(\text{none}) = \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} \]

2. **Probability that exactly one of the four numbers she chooses is the same as the four numbers chosen at random:**
   There are \(\binom{4}{1}\) ways to choose 1 number from the 4 numbers that are the same as the four numbers chosen at random, and \(\binom{6}{3}\) ways to choose the remaining 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers. Therefore, the probability is:

   \[ P(\text{one}) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \cdot 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21} \]

Adding these probabilities together gives the probability that none or exactly one of the four numbers she chooses is the same as the four numbers chosen at random:

\[ P(\text{none or one}) = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42} \]

Therefore, the probability that at least two of the four numbers she chooses are the same as the four numbers chosen at random is:

\[ P(B) = 1 - P(\text{none or one}) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42} \]

Now, we can find the conditional probability \( P(A \mid B) \):

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{210 \cdot 23} = \frac{1}{5 \cdot 23} = \frac{1}{115} \]

The probability that Guanya guanya l'grand premise given that she has guanya un premise is \(\frac{1}{115}\). Therefore, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), and \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

"Given that rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are drawn such that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, we need to find the length of \(CE\). We start by noting that since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is a cyclic quadrilateral. This implies that the opposite angles of \(ADHG\) sum to \(180^\circ\).

First, we calculate the length of the diagonal \(AC\) of rectangle \(ABCD\):
\[
AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 256} = \sqrt{11705} = 108.2.
\]
Next, we calculate the length of the diagonal \(FH\) of rectangle \(EFGH\):
\[
FH = \sqrt{EF^2 + FG^2} = \sqrt{184^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{33856 + 289} = \sqrt{34145} = 184.8.
\]
Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the power of point \(D\) with respect to the circle is the same when considering the segments of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(FH\). The power of point \(D\) is given by:
\[
AD \cdot DG = CD \cdot DB.
\]
Since \(D\) is a vertex of rectangle \(ABCD\), we have \(AD = BC = 16\) and \(DB = AB = 107\). Therefore,
\[
AD \cdot DG = 16 \cdot 107 = 1712.
\]
Similarly, since \(H\) is a vertex of rectangle \(EFGH\), we have \(FH = 184.8\) and \(FH = EF + EF = 184 + 184 = 368\). Therefore,
\[
FH \cdot FH = 184 \cdot 184 = 33856.
\]
Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can express \(CE\) as \(CE = CD + DE\). Let \(DE = x\). Then \(CE = 16 + x\). Since \(D\) and \(H\) are on the circle, we have:
\[
AD \cdot DG = CD \cdot DB = DE \cdot DF.
\]
Since \(DF = CD + CF = 16 + 17 = 33\), we have:
\[
1712 = x \cdot 33.
\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{1712}{33} = 51.87.
\]
Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:
\[
CE = 16 + 51.87 = 67.
\]
Thus, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths of length 16 in an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times. A path in this context consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves.

A path that changes direction exactly four times means that there are five segments in the path, each consisting of a sequence of either only R's or only U's. For example, a path might look like RRRRUUUU, or RRUURRRU, or UURURURU, etc.

To form such a path, we need to choose 4 positions out of the 9 possible positions (between the segments) to place the changes in direction. This can be done in \(\binom{9}{4}\) ways. Once we have chosen the positions of the changes in direction, we can arrange the R's and U's in the segments. Since there are 5 segments and we need to distribute 8 R's and 8 U's among them, we need to choose 4 out of the 5 segments to be R's (the remaining segment will automatically be U's). This can be done in \(\binom{5}{4}\) ways.

However, we need to ensure that the path starts with an R and ends with a U. This means that the first segment must be R and the last segment must be U. Therefore, we only need to choose 2 out of the remaining 3 segments to be R's (the remaining segment will automatically be U's). This can be done in \(\binom{3}{2}\) ways.

Thus, the total number of paths is given by:
\[
\binom{9}{4} \times \binom{3}{2} = 126 \times 3 = 378

"Given the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the maximum possible real part of this expression.

First, let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:
\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).

We expand both products:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).

Combining like terms, we have:
\[

\]

This simplifies to:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).

The real part of the expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

To find the maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), we use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so we have:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given that two circles of radius 34 are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) respectively, and 2024 circles of radius 1 are arranged in a similar manner.

First, let's consider the arrangement of the circles. The two larger circles of radius 34 are tangent to each other and to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) respectively. This means that the distance between the centers of these two circles is \(34 + 34 = 68\). The centers of these circles are also at a distance of 34 from the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\), respectively.

Now, let's consider the smaller circles of radius 1. These circles are arranged in a similar manner, forming a chain of circles that are tangent to each other and to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\). The distance between the centers of two adjacent smaller circles is \(1 + 1 = 2\). The centers of these circles are also at a distance of 1 from the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\), respectively.

Since there are 2024 smaller circles, the total distance along the chain of smaller circles is \(2024 \times 2 = 4048\). This distance is the same as the distance between the centers of the two larger circles, which is 68, plus the distance from the center of the first smaller circle to the side \(AB\) and the distance from the center of the last smaller circle to the side \(BC\). Therefore, the total distance along the chain of smaller circles is \(68 + 1 + 1 = 70\) plus the distance between the centers of the two larger circles and the centers of the smaller circles.

The distance between the centers of the two larger circles and the centers of the smaller circles is the same as the distance between the centers of the two larger circles, which is 68. Therefore, the total distance along the chain of smaller circles is \(68 + 1 + 1 = 70\).

The inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is the distance from the incenter to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\), which is the radius of the smaller circles, which is 1. Therefore, the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{34 \times 2024 + 1}{2024 + 1} = \frac{68968 + 1}{2025} = \frac{68969}{2025}\).

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the major number real that is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombuses \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.

Since the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles and bisect each other, the coordinates of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be expressed as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\), so \(BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\).

Since \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1\). We can express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\) as follows:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies 24x_1^2 - 20y_1^2 = 480 \implies 6x_1^2 - 5y_1^2 = 120 \implies y_1^2 = \frac{6x_1^2 - 120}{5}.
\]
Substituting \(y_1^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_1^2 + \frac{6x_1^2 - 120}{5}\right) = 4\left(\frac{5x_1^2 + 6x_1^2 - 120}{5}\right) = 4\left(\frac{11x_1^2 - 120}{5}\right) = \frac{44x_1^2 - 480}{5}.
\]
To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we need to minimize \(44x_1^2 - 480\). Since \(x_1^2\) is always non-negative, the minimum value of \(44x_1^2 - 480\) occurs when \(x_1^2 = 0\):
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44 \cdot 0 - 480}{5} = -96.
\]
However, since \(BD^2\) represents a squared length, it must be positive. Therefore, we need to find the minimum positive value of \(BD^2\). As \(x_1^2\) increases, \(BD^2\) increases without bound. The smallest positive value of \(BD^2\) occurs when \(x_1^2\) is just greater than 0, but since \(x_1^2\) cannot be exactly 0 (it would make \(y_1^2\) undefined), the smallest positive value of \(BD^2\) is greater than 0.

- \( B \): the set of residents who posseeix a game of golf.
- \( C \): the set of residents who posseeix a pal of garden.
- \( D \): the set of residents who posseeix a boss of cors of caramel.

We are given the following information:

- \( |B| = 367 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- \( |D| = 900 \)
- \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 \) (the number of residents who posseeix exactly two items)

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \) such that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \), we need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall that the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OIA = 90^\circ \). In a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R \), so \( OA = 13 \). Let \( AI = d \). By the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( OIA \), we have:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + AI^2 \implies 13^2 = 13 + d^2 \implies 169 = 13 + d^2 \implies d^2 = 156 \implies d = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( AI \) is also given by the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex of the triangle:
\[
AI = \frac{\sqrt{bc(s-a)}}{s}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius \( r \) and the semiperimeter \( s \) as:
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = 6s
\]
The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) as:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52} \implies abc = 312s
\]

We also know that:
\[
AI^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s} \implies (2\sqrt{39})^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s} \implies 156 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s} \implies bc(s-a) = 156s
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we have \( s-a = \frac{b+c-a}{2} \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
bc \left( \frac{b+c-a}{2} \right) = 156s \implies bc(b+c-a) = 312s
\]
We already know that \( abc = 312s \), so we can substitute \( 312s \) for \( abc \) in the equation:
\[
bc(b+c-a) = abc \implies bc(b+c-a) = bc \cdot a \implies b+c-a = a \implies b+c = 2a
\]
Thus, the triangle is isosceles with \( b = c \). Let \( b = c = x \). Then \( a = \frac{b+c}{2} = \frac{x+x}{2} = x \), so the triangle is actually equilateral. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so \( AB = AC = BC = x \).

The area \( \Delta \) of an equilateral triangle with side length \( x \) is given by:
\[
\Delta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x^2
\]
We also know that the area \( \Delta \) is \( 6s \), and since \( s = \frac{3x}{2} \), we have:
\[
\Delta = 6 \cdot \frac{3x}{2} = 9x
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x^2 = 9x \implies \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x = 9 \implies x = \frac{9 \cdot 4}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{36}{\sqrt{3}} = 12\sqrt{3}
\]
Therefore, \( AB \cdot AC = x^2 = (12\sqrt{3})^2 = 432 \).

"To solve for the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.
\]

We need to find integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy both \(a + b + c = 300\) and the equation above. Let's consider the case where two of the variables are equal. Without loss of generality, assume \(a = b\). Then the equations become:

\[
2a + c = 300 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2c + 2a^2c = 3a^2c = 100(a^2 + ac + ac) - 2,000,000.
\]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[
3a^2c = 100a^2 + 200ac - 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
3a^2c - 200ac - 100a^2 + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(a\), we get:

\[
a(3ac - 200c - 100a) + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

Since \(c = 300 - 2a\), substitute \(c\) into the equation:

\[
a(3a(300 - 2a) - 200(300 - 2a) - 100a) + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
a(900a - 6a^2 - 60,000 + 400a - 100a) + 2,000,000 = 0,
\]
\[
a(1200a - 6a^2 - 60,000) + 2,000,000 = 0,
\]
\[
-6a^3 + 1200a^2 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0,
\]
\[
-6(a^3 - 200a^2 + 10,000a - 333,333.33) = 0,
\]
\[
a^3 - 200a^2 + 10,000a - 333,333.33 = 0.
\]

By inspection or using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that \(a = 100\) is a root. Substituting \(a = 100\) into \(c = 300 - 2a\), we get:

\[
c = 300 - 2 \cdot 100 = 100.
\]

Thus, the solution is \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\). Since the equation is symmetric in \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the only solution is \((100, 100, 100)\).

Therefore, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given equations is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find a point \(C\) on the segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not lie on any segment of the family \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1 in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis.

First, let's parameterize the point \(C\) on the segment \(\overline{AB}\). Since \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\), the coordinates of \(C\) can be written as:
\[
C = \left(\frac{1}{2} - t, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)
\]
for some \(t\) in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Next, we need to determine the conditions under which \(C\) does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1. A segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with \(P = (a, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, b)\) has the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1
\]
Since the length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1, we have:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 1 \implies a^2 + b^2 = 1
\]

Substitute the coordinates of \(C\) into the equation of the line:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} - t}{a} + \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t}{b} = 1
\]
Multiply through by \(ab\) to clear the denominators:
\[
b\left(\frac{1}{2} - t\right) + a\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right) = ab
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
\frac{b}{2} - bt + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}at = ab
\]
Rearrange to isolate terms involving \(t\):
\[
\frac{b}{2} + t\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a - b\right) = ab
\]
Solve for \(t\):
\[
t\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a - b\right) = ab - \frac{b}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{ab - \frac{b}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a - b}
\]
\[
t = \frac{b(2a - 1)}{\sqrt{3}a - 2b}
\]

For \(C\) to not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) except \(\overline{AB}\), \(t\) must not be in the interval \([0, 1]\) for any \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\). We need to find \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(t = 1\):
\[
1 = \frac{b(2a - 1)}{\sqrt{3}a - 2b}
\]
Cross-multiply to solve for \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
\sqrt{3}a - 2b = b(2a - 1)
\]
\[
\sqrt{3}a - 2b = 2ab - b
\]
\[
\sqrt{3}a - b = 2ab
\]
Rearrange to form a quadratic equation in \(a\):
\[
2ab - \sqrt{3}a + b = 0
\]
Factor out \(a\):
\[
a(2b - \sqrt{3}) + b = 0
\]
Solve for \(a\):
\[
a = -\frac{b}{2b - \sqrt{3}}
\]

Substitute \(a = -\frac{b}{2b - \sqrt{3}}\) into the equation \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\):
\[
\left(-\frac{b}{2b - \sqrt{3}}\right)^2 + b^2 = 1
\]
\[
\frac{b^2}{(2b - \sqrt{3})^2} + b^2 = 1
\]
Multiply through by \((2b - \sqrt{3})^2\):
\[
b^2 + b^2(2b - \sqrt{3})^2 = (2b - \sqrt{3})^2
\]
Expand and simplify:
\[
b^2 + b^2(4b^2 - 4b\sqrt{3} + 3) = 4b^2 - 4b\sqrt{3} + 3
\]
\[
b^2 + 4b^4 - 4b^3\sqrt{3} + 3b^2 = 4b^2 - 4b\sqrt{3} + 3
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
4b^4 - 4b^3\sqrt{3} + 4b^2 = 4b^2 - 4b\sqrt{3} + 3
\]
Subtract \(4b^2\) from both sides:
\[
4b^4 - 4b^3\sqrt{3} = -4b\sqrt{3} + 3
\]
Rearrange to form a polynomial equation:
\[
4b^4 - 4b^3\sqrt{3} + 4b\sqrt{3} - 3 = 0
\]

By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) is a solution. Substituting \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) back into \(a = -\frac{b}{2b - \sqrt{3}}\):
\[
a = -\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3}} = -\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{0}
\]

Thus, \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) is the point \(C\). Therefore, \(C = \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).

Finally, calculate \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = 1

Thus, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{1}\), and \(p + q = 1 + 1 = 2\).

"Given that \(\omega \neq 1\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to find the residue of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) when divided by 1000.

First, observe that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be factored as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).
\]
By substituting \(x = 2\), we get:
\[
2^{13} - 1 = (2-1)(2-\omega)(2-\omega^2) \cdots (2-\omega^{12}) = 1 \cdot (2-\omega)(2-\omega^2) \cdots (2-\omega^{12}).
\]
Thus,
\[
(2-\omega)(2-\omega^2) \cdots (2-\omega^{12}) = 2^{13} - 1 = 8191.
\]
We need to find the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that:
\[
2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k} = 2(1-\omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.
\]
We can rewrite the product as:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left(2(1-\omega^k) + \omega^{2k}\right).
\]
To simplify this, consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\). The roots of \(P(x)\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). The polynomial \(P(x)\) can also be written as:
\[
P(x) = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).
\]
By substituting \(x = 2\), we get:
\[
P(2) = (2-1)(2-\omega)(2-\omega^2) \cdots (2-\omega^{12}) = 8191.
\]
Now, consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{13} - 1\) again, but this time we substitute \(x = \omega^2\):
\[
Q(\omega^2) = (\omega^2)^{13} - 1 = \omega^{26} - 1 = (\omega^{13})^2 - 1 = 1^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
This means that \(\omega^2\) is a root of \(Q(x)\), and similarly, \(\omega^4, \omega^6, \ldots, \omega^{24}\) are also roots of \(Q(x)\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
Q(x) = (x-1)(x-\omega^2)(x-\omega^4) \cdots (x-\omega^{24}).
\]
By substituting \(x = 2\), we get:
\[
Q(2) = (2-1)(2-\omega^2)(2-\omega^4) \cdots (2-\omega^{24}) = 1 \cdot (2-\omega^2)(2-\omega^4) \cdots (2-\omega^{24}).
\]
Thus,
\[
(2-\omega^2)(2-\omega^4) \cdots (2-\omega^{24}) = 2^{13} - 1 = 8191.
\]
Now, we need to find the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that:
\[
2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k} = 2(1-\omega^k) + \omega^{2k} = 2(1-\omega^k) + \omega^{2k} = 2(1-\omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.
\]
By symmetry and properties of roots of unity, we can see that:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 8191^2.
\]
Finally, we need to find the residue of \(8191^2\) when divided by 1000. We compute:
\[
8191^2 \equiv 191^2 \pmod{1000}.
\]
Now, we compute \(191^2\):
\[
191^2 = 36481.
\]
The residue of 36481 when divided by 1000 is:
\[
36481 \equiv 481 \pmod{1000}.
\]
Therefore, the residue of \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) when divided by 1000 is:

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) such that each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the possible choices for the vertices of the rectangle.

A rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized by their lengths. The possible lengths of the sides and diagonals are the distances between vertices that are 1, 2, 3, ..., 6 vertices apart (since the dodecagon is symmetric, the distances between vertices that are more than 6 vertices apart are the same as those between vertices that are fewer than 6 vertices apart).

We will count the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides for each possible length.

1. **Sides (distance between vertices is 1):**
   - There are 12 sides in the dodecagon.
   - We can choose any 2 out of these 12 sides to form a rectangle, but we need to ensure they are parallel. Since the dodecagon is regular, each side has a unique parallel side.
   - Therefore, there are \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pairs of parallel sides.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of parallel sides from these 6 pairs is \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).

2. **Diagonals of length 2 (distance between vertices is 2):**
   - There are 12 diagonals of length 2.
   - Similarly, each diagonal of length 2 has a unique parallel diagonal.
   - Therefore, there are \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pairs of parallel diagonals.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of parallel diagonals from these 6 pairs is \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).

3. **Diagonals of length 3 (distance between vertices is 3):**
   - There are 12 diagonals of length 3.
   - Each diagonal of length 3 has a unique parallel diagonal.
   - Therefore, there are \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pairs of parallel diagonals.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of parallel diagonals from these 6 pairs is \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).

4. **Diagonals of length 4 (distance between vertices is 4):**
   - There are 12 diagonals of length 4.
   - Each diagonal of length 4 has a unique parallel diagonal.
   - Therefore, there are \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pairs of parallel diagonals.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of parallel diagonals from these 6 pairs is \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).

5. **Diagonals of length 5 (distance between vertices is 5):**
   - There are 12 diagonals of length 5.
   - Each diagonal of length 5 has a unique parallel diagonal.
   - Therefore, there are \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pairs of parallel diagonals.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of parallel diagonals from these 6 pairs is \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).

6. **Diagonals of length 6 (distance between vertices is 6):**
   - There are 12 diagonals of length 6.
   - Each diagonal of length 6 has a unique parallel diagonal.
   - Therefore, there are \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pairs of parallel diagonals.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of parallel diagonals from these 6 pairs is \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).

"Given the properties of the list of positive integers:
1. The sum of the elements is 30.
2. The mode is uniquely 9.
3. The median is an integer that does not appear in the list.

Let's denote the list in ascending order as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\). Since the mode is 9 and it is unique, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. The median is the middle number if \(n\) is odd, or the average of the two middle numbers if \(n\) is even. Since the median does not appear in the list, \(n\) must be even. Let \(n = 2k\). The median is then \(\frac{a_k + a_{k+1}}{2}\).

Since 9 is the mode, let's assume it appears \(m\) times. Then \(m \geq 2\) (because it must appear more frequently than any other number). If \(m = 2\), then the list would be \(a_1, a_2, 9, 9, a_5, \ldots, a_{2k}\). The median would be \(\frac{a_k + a_{k+1}}{2}\), and since \(a_k\) and \(a_{k+1}\) cannot both be 9 (because the median does not appear in the list), one of them must be 9 and the other must be different.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in the rows is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in the columns is 99.

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
The two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in the rows are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:
\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
Since 999 is composed of the digits 9, 9, and 9, it follows that:
\[
a + d = 9, \quad b + e = 9, \quad c + f = 9
\]
Next, we consider the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in the columns: \(100a + 10d + f\), \(100b + 10e + c\), and \(100c + 10f + a\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:
\[
100a + 10d + f + 100b + 10e + c + 100c + 10f + a = 99
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
101a + 101b + 101c + 11d + 11e + 11f = 99
\]
Factoring out the common factors, we get:
\[
101(a + b + c) + 11(d + e + f) = 99
\]
Since 101 is not a factor of 99, it must be that \(a + b + c = 0\) and \(d + e + f = 9\). However, since \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) are digits (0 through 9), the only way \(a + b + c = 0\) is if \(a = b = c = 0\). This would make \(d + e + f = 9\), which is consistent with our earlier equations \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\). Therefore, \(d = 9\), \(e = 9\), and \(f = 9\).

Thus, the only solution is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

0 & 0 & 0 \\

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by expressing each equation in exponential form. The first equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(yz\), we get:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz
\]

The second equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(xz\), we get:

\[
y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz
\]

The third equation is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(xy\), we get:

\[
z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz\)
2. \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\)
3. \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\)

We can substitute the expressions for \(y\) and \(z\) from the second and third equations into the first equation. First, substitute \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\) into the first equation:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot (2^{1/3} \cdot xz) \cdot z = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot xz^2
\]

Divide both sides by \(x\) (since \(x \neq 0\)):

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot z^2
\]

Recall that \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
1 = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot z^2 = 2^{1/2 + 1/3} \cdot z^2 = 2^{5/6} \cdot z^2
\]

Solving for \(z^2\), we get:

\[
z^2 = \frac{1}{2^{5/6}} = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

Next, substitute \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into the second equation:

\[
y = 2^{1/3} \cdot x \cdot 2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/3 - 5/12} \cdot x = 2^{4/12 - 5/12} \cdot x = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x
\]

So, we have:

\[
y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x
\]

Finally, substitute \(y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into the third equation:

\[
z = 2^{1/4} \cdot x \cdot (2^{-1/12} \cdot x) = 2^{1/4} \cdot 2^{-1/12} \cdot x^2 = 2^{1/4 - 1/12} \cdot x^2 = 2^{3/12 - 1/12} \cdot x^2 = 2^{2/12} \cdot x^2 = 2^{1/6} \cdot x^2
\]

Since we already know that \(z = 2^{-5/12}\), we can set the two expressions for \(z\) equal to each other:

\[
2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/6} \cdot x^2
\]

Recall that \(2^{1/6} = 2^{2/12}\), so we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2^{-5/12} = 2^{2/12} \cdot x^2
\]

Dividing both sides by \(2^{2/12}\), we get:

\[
2^{-5/12 - 2/12} = x^2 \implies 2^{-7/12} = x^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
x = 2^{-7/24}
\]

Now we have \(x = 2^{-7/24}\), \(y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x = 2^{-1/12} \cdot 2^{-7/24} = 2^{-2/24 - 7/24} = 2^{-9/24} = 2^{-3/8}\), and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).

We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4y^3z^2 = (2^{-7/24})^4 \cdot (2^{-3/8})^3 \cdot (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6}
\]

To add the exponents, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24, so we rewrite the exponents with a denominator of 24:

\[
-7/6 = -28/24, \quad -9/8 = -27/24, \quad -5/6 = -20/24
\]

Adding these exponents, we get:

\[
-28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24 = -75/24 = -25/8
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
x^4y^3z^2 = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

The absolute value is:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), and \(m+n = 25+8 = 33\). The final answer is:

"Given a regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, we know that the hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids by drawing the lines \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\). These lines intersect at a common point \(O\), and they form a triangle with sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the length of a side of the hexagon.

First, let's denote the length of a side of the hexagon by \(s\). Since the hexagon is equilateral and all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are parallel and equal in length to \(s\). The triangle formed by the extensions of these sides is similar to the triangle formed by the segments connecting the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon, which is also similar to the triangle formed by the diagonals \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\).

The triangle formed by the extensions of the sides of the hexagon is similar to the triangle formed by the diagonals, and the ratio of the sides of these triangles is the same as the ratio of the distances from the center of the hexagon to the sides of the hexagon to the distance from the center to the vertices of the hexagon. This ratio is \(1:2\), because the distance from the center to the vertices is twice the distance from the center to the sides.

Therefore, the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides of the hexagon are twice the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the diagonals. Let the side lengths of the triangle formed by the diagonals be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Then we have:
\[2a = 200, \quad 2b = 240, \quad 2c = 300.\]
Solving for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we get:
\[a = 100, \quad b = 120, \quad c = 150.\]

The side length of the hexagon is equal to the side length of the triangle formed by the diagonals, which is the average of the side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is:
\[s = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{6} = \frac{740}{6} = 120.\]

Thus, the length of the side of the hexagon is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the set \( A \) such that the number of non-empty finite subsets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \) is 2024. Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the number of non-empty subsets \( B \) where the maximum element is \( a_i \) is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1\} \). The number of non-empty subsets of a set with \( k \) elements is \( 2^k - 1 \). Therefore, the number of non-empty subsets \( B \) where the maximum element is \( a_i \) is \( 2^{a_i-1} - 1 \).

The total number of non-empty subsets \( B \) is the sum of the number of such subsets for each element in \( A \):
\[
(2^{a_1-1} - 1) + (2^{a_2-1} - 1) + \cdots + (2^{a_n-1} - 1) = 2024.

This can be rewritten as:
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} - n = 2024.

Adding \( n \) to both sides, we get:
\[

We need to find \( n \) and the corresponding \( a_i \) such that the left side is a sum of distinct powers of 2. First, we find the binary representation of 2024:
\[

\]
This binary representation tells us that:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2.

Thus, we can write:

We need to find \( N \) such that \( N - a + 1 \), \( N - b + 1 \), \( N - c + 1 \), and \( N - d + 1 \) are all divisible by 7. This can be written as:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it descends to the exterior of \( S \) in two different orientations.

First, let's analyze the geometry of the torus and the sphere:
- The torus \( T \) is generated by revolving a circle of radius \( 3 \) around an axis that is \( 6 \) units away from the center of the circle.
- The sphere \( S \) has a radius of \( 11 \).

### Tangency external to the sphere along a circle \( r_i \)
When the torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle \( r_i \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle of tangency is \( 11 + r_i \).

The center of the circle of tangency is also the center of the circle that generates the torus, which is \( 6 \) units away from the center of the original circle. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the original circle is \( 6 \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution, we have:
\[
(11 + r_i)^2 = 6^2 + 3^2
\]
\[
(11 + r_i)^2 = 36 + 9
\]
\[
(11 + r_i)^2 = 45
\]
\[
11 + r_i = \sqrt{45}
\]
\[
11 + r_i = 3\sqrt{5}
\]
\[
r_i = 3\sqrt{5} - 11
\]

### Tangency external to the sphere along a circle \( r_o \)
When the torus is tangent externally to the sphere along a circle \( r_o \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle of tangency is \( 11 - r_o \).

The center of the circle of tangency is also the center of the circle that generates the torus, which is \( 6 \) units away from the center of the original circle. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the original circle is \( 6 \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution, we have:
\[
(11 - r_o)^2 = 6^2 + 3^2
\]
\[
(11 - r_o)^2 = 36 + 9
\]
\[
(11 - r_o)^2 = 45
\]
\[
11 - r_o = \sqrt{45}
\]
\[
11 - r_o = 3\sqrt{5}
\]
\[
r_o = 11 - 3\sqrt{5}
\]

### Finding the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
Now, we calculate the difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \):
\[
r_i - r_o = (3\sqrt{5} - 11) - (11 - 3\sqrt{5})
\]
\[
r_i - r_o = 3\sqrt{5} - 11 - 11 + 3\sqrt{5}
\]
\[
r_i - r_o = 6\sqrt{5} - 22
\]

### Expressing the difference in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \)
The expression \( 6\sqrt{5} - 22 \) is already in a form that can be written as \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m = 6\sqrt{5} - 22 \) and \( n = 1 \). However, since \( 6\sqrt{5} - 22 \) is not a rational number, we need to rationalize it.

To rationalize \( 6\sqrt{5} - 22 \), we need to find a rational number that is equivalent to \( 6\sqrt{5} - 22 \). This is not possible since \( 6\sqrt{5} - 22 \) is already in its simplest form.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the fitces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one fitx, all the fitces in the same row and all the fitces in the same column have the same color, and any additional fitx added to the grid violates at least one of these conditions.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the possible configurations:**
   - We can place fitces in either all white or all black.
   - We can place fitces in any subset of rows and any subset of columns.

2. **Count the number of ways to choose subsets of rows and columns:**
   - There are \(2^5 = 32\) subsets of rows (including the empty set).
   - There are \(2^5 = 32\) subsets of columns (including the empty set).

3. **Calculate the total number of configurations:**
   - For each pair of subsets of rows and columns, we can place fitces in all cells of the intersection of these subsets.
   - Therefore, the total number of configurations is \(32 \times 32 = 1024\).

4. **Exclude the empty configuration:**
   - The empty configuration (where no fitces are placed) does not satisfy the condition that there must be at least one fitx.
   - Thus, we subtract 1 from the total number of configurations.

5. **Final answer:**
   - The number of valid configurations is \(1024 - 1 = 1023\).

Therefore, the number of ways to place some of the fitces in the \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one fitx, all the fitces in the same row and all the fitces in the same column have the same color, and any additional fitx added to the grid violates at least one of these conditions is \(\boxed{1023}\).","[1023, '1023']",902,"[902, '902']",False
