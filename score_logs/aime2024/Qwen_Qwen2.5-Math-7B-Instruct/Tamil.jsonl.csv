"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( s \) and \( t \) from the given information and then use these values to find out how many minutes it takes for உநா to travel \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per minute.

First, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

1. When உநா travels \( s \) kilometers per minute, she takes 4 hours to complete the journey. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equivalent to \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) minutes. Therefore, the total distance \( d \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   d = s \times 240
   \]

2. When உநா travels \( s + 2 \) kilometers per minute, she takes 2 hours and 24 minutes to complete the journey. Since 2 hours and 24 minutes is equivalent to \( 2 \times 60 + 24 = 144 \) minutes, the total distance \( d \) can also be expressed as:
   \[
   d = (s + 2) \times 144
   \]

Since both expressions represent the same distance \( d \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
s \times 240 = (s + 2) \times 144
\]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[
240s = 144s + 288
\]

Subtract \( 144s \) from both sides:
\[
96s = 288
\]

Divide both sides by 96:
\[
s = 3
\]

Now that we have \( s = 3 \), we can substitute this value back into the expression for the total distance \( d \):
\[
d = 3 \times 240 = 720 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes it takes for உநா to travel \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 + \frac{1}{2} = 3.5 \) kilometers per minute. The time \( t \) can be calculated as:
\[
t = \frac{d}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{720}{3.5}
\]

To simplify the division, we can convert 3.5 to a fraction:
\[
3.5 = \frac{7}{2}
\]

So the time \( t \) becomes:
\[
t = \frac{720}{\frac{7}{2}} = 720 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{1440}{7} = 205.71428571428571
\]

Therefore, the number of minutes it takes for உநா to travel \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per minute is:

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of the tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12.
\]

Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}.
\]

The radius \(R\) of the circumcircle \(\omega\) can be found using the formula:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}.
\]

Since \(D\) is the point where the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\) meet, \(BD = CD\). By the power of a point theorem, we have:
\[
BD^2 = AB \cdot BC = 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \implies BD = CD = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}.
\]

The point \(P\) is the intersection of \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\). By the power of a point theorem again, we have:
\[
AD \cdot DP = BD^2 = 45.
\]

Since \(AD\) is a cevian of triangle \(ABC\) and \(P\) is the second intersection of \(AD\) with the circumcircle, \(AP\) and \(DP\) are segments of the same line. Let \(AP = x\) and \(DP = y\). Then:
\[
x \cdot y = 45.
\]

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the cevian \(AD\) divides the opposite side \(BC\) in the ratio of the other two sides:
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Since \(BD = CD\), \(D\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\). Therefore, \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Using the formula for the length of the angle bisector, we have:
\[
AD^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB+AC)^2}\right) = 5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5+10)^2}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{9}{25}\right) = 50 \cdot \frac{16}{25} = 32.
\]
Thus, \(AD = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\).

Since \(AD = AP + PD\) and \(AP \cdot PD = 45\), we can solve for \(AP\) and \(PD\) by solving the quadratic equation:
\[
t^2 - 4\sqrt{2}t + 45 = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
t = \frac{4\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{(4\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 45}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{32 - 180}}{2} = \frac{4\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{-148}}{2} = \frac{4\sqrt{2} \pm 2i\sqrt{37}}{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \pm i\sqrt{37}.
\]
Since \(AP\) and \(PD\) are real numbers, we need to re-equality the correct values. The correct values are:
\[
AP = \frac{45}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{45\sqrt{2}}{8}.
\]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{45\sqrt{2}}{8}\), and \(m = 45\) and \(n = 8\). Therefore, \(m + n = 45 + 8 = 53\).

\[
\boxed{53}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that after rearranging the vertices of an octahedron, all the blue vertices will be in the first half of the vertices, and all the red vertices will be in the second half of the vertices.

An octahedron has 8 vertices. If we label the vertices as \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\), then the first half of the vertices are \(1, 2, 3, 4\) and the second half are \(5, 6, 7, 8\). We need to find the probability that after a random rearrangement, all the blue vertices are in the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) and all the red vertices are in the set \(\{5, 6, 7, 8\}\).

The total number of ways to arrange 8 vertices is \(8!\) (8 factorial), which is the number of permutations of 8 distinct objects. However, since we have 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices, and the order of the blue vertices among themselves and the order of the red vertices among themselves do not matter, we need to divide by \(4! \times 4!\) to account for these internal arrangements. Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the vertices such that the blue vertices are in the first half and the red vertices are in the second half is:

\[
\frac{4! \times 4!}{4! \times 4!} = 1
\]

The total number of ways to arrange the 8 vertices without any restriction is:

\[
8! = 40320
\]

Since there is only 1 favorable arrangement out of 40320 possible arrangements, the probability is:

\[
\frac{1}{70}
\]

Thus, the probability that after rearranging the vertices, all the blue vertices will be in the first half and all the red vertices will be in the second half is \(\frac{1}{70}\). Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 70\), so \(m + n = 1 + 70 = 71\).

"To find the number of intersection points of the curves \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \]
\[ g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \]

The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, let's consider the composition \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( |f(\sin(2\pi x))| \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

Similarly, let's consider the composition \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( |f(\cos(3\pi y))| \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

Now, we need to find the points of intersection of the curves \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \). Since both \( y \) and \( x \) range from \(0\) to \(1\), we need to find the points where:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]

Let's analyze the possible values of \( y \) and \( x \):
- If \( y = 0 \), then \( 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = 0 \), which implies \( g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) = 0 \). This occurs when \( f(\sin (2 \pi x)) = 0 \), which means \( \sin (2 \pi x) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{4} + k \) or \( x = \frac{3}{4} + k \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( x \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\), the possible values of \( x \) are \( \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} \).
- If \( x = 0 \), then \( 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) = 0 \), which implies \( g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) = 0 \). This occurs when \( f(\cos (3 \pi y)) = 0 \), which means \( \cos (3 \pi y) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( y = \frac{1}{6} + k \) or \( y = \frac{5}{6} + k \) for any integer \( k \). Since \( y \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\), the possible values of \( y \) are \( \frac{1}{6} \) and \( \frac{5}{6} \).

Now, we need to check if these points satisfy both equations:
- For \( x = \frac{1}{4} \), \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi \cdot \frac{1}{4}))) = 4 g(f(\frac{1}{2})) = 4 g(0) = 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \). So, \( \left( \frac{1}{4}, 0 \right) \) is a solution.
- For \( x = \frac{3}{4} \), \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi \cdot \frac{3}{4}))) = 4 g(f(-\frac{1}{2})) = 4 g(0) = 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \). So, \( \left( \frac{3}{4}, 0 \right) \) is a solution.
- For \( y = \frac{1}{6} \), \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi \cdot \frac{1}{6}))) = 4 g(f(\frac{1}{2})) = 4 g(0) = 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \). So, \( \left( 0, \frac{1}{6} \right) \) is a solution.
- For \( y = \frac{5}{6} \), \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi \cdot \frac{5}{6}))) = 4 g(f(-\frac{1}{2})) = 4 g(0) = 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \). So, \( \left( 0, \frac{5}{6} \right) \) is a solution.

Therefore, the points of intersection are \( \left( \frac{1}{4}, 0 \right) \), \( \left( \frac{3}{4}, 0 \right) \), \( \left( 0, \frac{1}{6} \right) \), and \( \left( 0, \frac{5}{6} \right) \). There are 4 such points.

The number of intersection points is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"Given that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \), we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) and then determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \).

First, let's consider the congruence \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \). Therefore, the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, and 8. However, since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the order cannot be 1, 2, or 4. Thus, the order must be 8.

This means that \( n \) is a primitive 8th root of unity modulo \( p^2 \). The polynomial whose roots are the primitive 8th roots of unity is \( x^4 + 1 \). Therefore, \( p^2 \) must divide the discriminant of \( x^4 + 1 \) or \( x^4 + 1 \) must have a root modulo \( p \).

The discriminant of \( x^4 + 1 \) is \( 256 \), and since \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), \( p \) must divide 256. The prime factors of 256 are 2, so \( p = 2 \).

Now, we need to verify that \( p = 2 \) works. We need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( 2^2 = 4 \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \). We check the values of \( m \) modulo 4:
- If \( m \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \) and \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) and \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \) and \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) and \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).

None of these values work for \( m \equiv 0, 1, 2, \) or \( 3 \pmod{4} \) except when we consider the next power of 2. Let's check \( p = 2^2 = 4 \) again but we need to check the next power of 2 again we need to check the next power of

"To find the distance from the center \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to any of its faces, we start by calculating the volume of the tetrahedron and then use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane.

First, we use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a = AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = AD = BC = \sqrt{89} \) is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & c^2 & b^2 \\
1 & b^2 & c^2 & 0 & a^2 \\
1 & c^2 & b^2 & a^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
288 V^2 = -\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Next, we perform row operations to simplify the determinant. Subtract the first row from the other rows:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
0 & -41 & 9 & -9 \\
0 & 45 & -80 & -48 \\
0 & 39 & -39 & -89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Now, expand along the first column:

\[
-\begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 9 & -9 \\
45 & -80 & -48 \\
39 & -39 & -89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can further simplify this determinant by factoring out common factors from the rows. Notice that the second row can be divided by 9 and the third row by 3:

\[
-\begin{vmatrix}
-41 & 9 & -9 \\
5 & -80/9 & -16 \\
13 & -13 & -89/3
\end{vmatrix}
\]

However, this approach is complex. Instead, we use a more straightforward method by calculating the volume using the known edge lengths and the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with equal edge lengths.

The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) can also be found using the formula:

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{4a^2b^2c^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2) + (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)}
\]

Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \):

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{4 \cdot 41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 - (41 + 80 + 89)(41 \cdot 80 + 80 \cdot 89 + 89 \cdot 41) + (41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)}
\]

After calculating the values and simplifying, we find:

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{1128960 - 1128960 + 1128960} = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{1128960} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 1060 = \frac{530}{3}
\]

The distance \( d \) from the center \( I \) to any face is given by:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A}
\]

where \( A \) is the area of one face. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]

For each face of the tetrahedron, the area is:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left( \frac{\sqrt{41 + 80 + 89}}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left( \frac{120}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 1600 = 400\sqrt{3}
\]

Thus, the distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{530}{3}}{400\sqrt{3}} = \frac{530}{400\sqrt{3}} = \frac{53}{40\sqrt{3}} = \frac{53\sqrt{3}}{120}
\]

Therefore, \( m = 53 \), \( n = 3 \), and \( p = 120 \), and:

\[
m + n + p = 53 + 3 + 120 = 176
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{176}

"To solve for \( r^2 \), we start by determining the volume of the original rectangular prism and the volume of each smaller sphere. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For the given rectangular prism, the dimensions are 54 meters, 23 meters, and 1 meter. Therefore, the volume is:

\[ V = 54 \times 23 \times 1 = 1242 \text{ cubic meters} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of one smaller sphere. The volume \( V_s \) of a sphere is given by the formula:

\[ V_s = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

Since there are 1242 smaller spheres and they completely fill the rectangular prism, the total volume of the spheres is equal to the volume of the rectangular prism. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 1242 = 1242 \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

To find \( r^3 \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1242:

\[ 1 = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^3 \) by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4 \pi}\):

\[ r^3 = \frac{3}{4 \pi} \]

To find \( r^2 \), we take the cube root of both sides and then square the result. First, we express \( r^3 \) in a form that allows us to find \( r^2 \):

\[ r = \left( \frac{3}{4 \pi} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \]

Then, we square both sides:

\[ r^2 = \left( \left( \frac{3}{4 \pi} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{3}{4 \pi} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} \]

We can rewrite this expression using the property of exponents:

\[ r^2 = \frac{3^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(4 \pi)^{\frac{2}{3}}} = \frac{3^{\frac{2}{3}}}{4^{\frac{2}{3}} \pi^{\frac{2}{3}}} = \frac{3^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(2^2)^{\frac{2}{3}} \pi^{\frac{2}{3}}} =

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each logarithmic expression.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ x \log_x(y) = 10. \]
By the change of base formula, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), so the equation becomes:
\[ x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\log(x)\), we get:
\[ x \log(y) = 10 \log(x). \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}. \]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ 4y \log_y(x) = 10. \]
By the change of base formula, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), so the equation becomes:
\[ 4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\log(y)\), we get:
\[ 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y). \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}. \]

Now we have two equations:
\[ \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}, \]
\[ \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}. \]

Since \(\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\) are reciprocals, we can multiply these two equations together:
\[ \left(\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\right) \left(\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\right) = \left(\frac{10}{x}\right) \left(\frac{5}{2y}\right). \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 1 = \frac{50}{2xy}, \]
\[ 1 = \frac{25}{xy}, \]
\[ xy = 25. \]

"Let's denote the number of ways�லிஸ் can win as \( W \) and the number of waysஹிமா can win as \( L \). We are given that \( W + L = 2024 \) and we need to find the number of pairs \((W, L)\) such that \( W \) and \( L \) are both even or both odd.

First, let's consider the case where both \( W \) and \( L \) are even. If \( W \) is even, we can write \( W = 2k \) for some integer \( k \). Then \( L = 2024 - 2k = 2(1012 - k) \), which is also even. Therefore, \( W \) can take any even value from 0 to 2024. The even numbers in this range are \( 0, 2, 4, \ldots, 2024 \). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 0, the common difference 2, and the last term 2024. The number of terms in this sequence is given by:
\[
\frac{2024 - 0}{2} + 1 = 1013
\]
So, there are 1013 pairs \((W, L)\) where both \( W \) and \( L \) are even.

Next, let's consider the case where both \( W \) and \( L \) are odd. If \( W \) is odd, we can write \( W = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Then \( L = 2024 - (2k + 1) = 2023 - 2k \), which is also odd. Therefore, \( W \) can take any odd value from 1 to 2023. The odd numbers in this range are \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2023 \). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 1, the common difference 2, and the last term 2023. The number of terms in this sequence is given by:
\[
\frac{2023 - 1}{2} + 1 = 1012
\]
So, there are 1012 pairs \((W, L)\) where both \( W \) and \( L \) are odd.

Adding the number of pairs where both \( W \) and \( L \) are even and the number of pairs where both \( W \) and \( L \) are odd, we get:
\[
1013 + 1012 = 2025

Therefore, the number of pairs \((W, L)\) such that \( W + L = 2024 \) and \( W \) and \( L \) are both even or both odd is \(\boxed{2025}\).","[2025, '2025']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen subset of 4 elements from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \) contains exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers, and then find the probability that a randomly chosen subset of 4 elements from \( S \) contains exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers, given that it does not contain exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers.

First, let's determine the total number of ways to choose 4 elements from 10 elements. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210

Next, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from the 5 even numbers in \( S \) and 2 odd numbers from the 5 odd numbers in \( S \). This is given by \( \binom{5}{2} \times \binom{5}{2} \):
\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10
\]
\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10
\]
\[
\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{5}{2} = 10 \times 10 = 100
\]

So, the probability that a randomly chosen subset of 4 elements contains exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers is:
\[
\frac{100}{210} = \frac{10}{21}
\]

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen subset of 4 elements contains exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers, given that it does not contain exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers. First, we find the number of subsets that do not contain exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers. This is the total number of subsets minus the number of subsets that contain exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers:
\[
210 - 100 = 110
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen subset of 4 elements contains exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers, given that it does not contain exactly 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers, is:
\[
\frac{100}{110} = \frac{10}{11}

"Given the squares \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) such that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, we need to find the length of \(CE\). Let's denote the side length of square \(ABCD\) as \(a\) and the side length of square \(EFGH\) as \(b\). Therefore, we have \(a = 107\) and \(b = 17\).

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the distance \(DF\) is the sum of the side lengths of the two squares, i.e., \(DF = a + b = 107 + 17 = 124\).

Next, we need to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is a cyclic quadrilateral. The diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral intersect at right angles if and only if the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals. However, in this problem, we can use the fact that \(CE\) is the same as the length of the diagonal of a rectangle formed by the side lengths of the two squares.

The length of the diagonal \(CE\) of the rectangle formed by the side lengths of the two squares can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
CE = \sqrt{(a + b)^2 + (b - a)^2}
\]
Substituting the values of \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
CE = \sqrt{124^2 + (17 - 107)^2} = \sqrt{124^2 + (-90)^2} = \sqrt{124^2 + 90^2}

Calculating the squares:
\[
124^2 = 15376 \quad \text{and} \quad 90^2 = 8100

Adding these values together:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, where each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U).

The total number of moves required to reach the top-right corner from the bottom-left corner is \(8 + 8 = 16\). Out of these 16 moves, we need to choose 8 moves to be right (R) and the remaining 8 moves to be up (U). This is a combinatorial problem where we need to find the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's in a sequence of 16 moves.

The number of distinct sequences of 8 R's and 8 U's is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 16 for the R's (or equivalently, the U's).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{16}{8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
\[
16! = 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8!
\]
\[
8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320
\]

Now, substitute these values into the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
\binom{16}{8} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8!}{8! \times 8!} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{8!}
\]

The \(8!\) in the numerator and the denominator cancel each other out:
\[
\binom{16}{8} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{40320}
\]

Next, we calculate the numerator:
\[
16 \times 15 = 240
\]
\[
240 \times 14 = 3360
\]
\[
3360 \times 13 = 43680
\]
\[
43680 \times 12 = 524160
\]
\[
524160 \times 11 = 5765760
\]
\[
5765760 \times 10 = 57657600
\]
\[
57657600 \times 9 = 518918400
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[
\frac{518918400}{40320} = 12870
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid is \(\boxed{12870}\).","[12870, '12870']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"Given that \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), we need to find the maximum real part of the expression \( (75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} \).

First, let's express \( z \) in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), we can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) for some real number \( \theta \). Then, the reciprocal \( \frac{1}{z} \) is \( \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + 24(3+4i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use Euler's formula \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Substituting these in, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 24(3+4i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

We expand both products:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24(3\cos\theta - 3i\sin\theta + 4i\cos\theta + 4\sin\theta).
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + (75+117)i\cos\theta) + 24(3\cos\theta + 4\sin\theta + (4-3)i\cos\theta).
\]

Distributing the constants, we get:
\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 4(75+117)i\cos\theta + 72\cos\theta + 96\sin\theta + 24(4-3)i\cos\theta.
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 72\cos\theta) + (-468\sin\theta + 96\sin\theta) + (4(75+117) + 24(4-3))i\cos\theta.
\]

Simplifying further, we get:
\[
372\cos\theta - 372\sin\theta + (4 \cdot 192 + 24 \cdot 1)i\cos\theta = 372\cos\theta - 372\sin\theta + 768i\cos\theta.
\]

The real part of this expression is \( 372\cos\theta - 372\sin\theta \). To find the maximum value of \( 372\cos\theta - 372\sin\theta \), we factor out 372:
\[
372(\cos\theta - \sin\theta).
\]

The maximum value of \( \cos\theta - \sin\theta \) is the amplitude of the function \( \cos\theta - \sin\theta \), which is \( \sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{2} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( 372(\cos\theta - \sin\theta) \) is:
\[
372 \cdot \sqrt{2} = 372\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the maximum real part of the expression is:

首先，让我们考虑初始配置，其中有两个圆与边 \(AB\) 和 \(BC\) 相切，且与大圆相切。设大圆的半径为 \(R\)，两个小圆的半径为 \(r\)。小圆与大圆相切，与边 \(AB\) 和 \(BC\) 相切，因此从大圆的中心到每个小圆的中心的距离是 \(R - r\)。小圆与边 \(AB\) 和 \(BC\) 相切，因此从每个小圆的中心到边 \(AB\) 和 \(BC\) 的距离是 \(r\)。从大圆的中心到边 \(AB\) 和 \(BC\) 的距离是 \(R - r + r = R\)。

现在，让我们考虑将这个配置扩展到2024个圆。每个圆与大圆相切，与前一个圆相切，与边 \(AB\) 和 \(BC\) 相切。从大圆的中心到第 \(n\) 个圆的中心的距离是 \(R - r + nr\)。当第2024个圆与边 \(AB\) 和 \(BC\) 相切时，从大圆的中心到第2024个圆的中心的距离是 \(R\)。因此，我们有：

\[ 2023r = 0 \]

三角形 \(ABC\) 的内切圆半径 \(r_i\) 由以下公式给出：
\[ r_i = \frac{r}{2} = \frac{R}{2 \times 2025} = \frac{R}{4050} \]

由于 \(R = 1\)，内切圆半径是：
\[ r_i = \frac{1}{4050} \]

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a square \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola with its vertices on the hyperbola and its diagonals passing through the origin.

First, let's assume the coordinates of the vertices of the square are \((a, a)\), \((-a, a)\), \((-a, -a)\), and \((a, -a)\). Since these points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation of the hyperbola:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{a^2}{24} = 1.
\]
Combining the terms on the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\frac{24a^2 - 20a^2}{20 \cdot 24} = 1 \implies \frac{4a^2}{480} = 1 \implies \frac{a^2}{120} = 1 \implies a^2 = 120.
\]
The length of the diagonal \(BD\) of the square is the distance between the points \((a, a)\) and \((-a, -a)\), which is:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(a - (-a))^2 + (a - (-a))^2} = \sqrt{(2a)^2 + (2a)^2} = \sqrt{4a^2 + 4a^2} = \sqrt{8a^2} = 2a\sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \(a^2 = 120\), we have \(a = \sqrt{120} = 2\sqrt{30}\). Therefore, the length of the diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
BD = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{30} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{60} = 8\sqrt{15}.
\]
The square of the length of the diagonal \(BD\) is:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Substituting the given value \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[
6,000,000 = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:

\[
2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc.
\]

Rearranging the terms, we have:

\[
abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.
\]

We need to find integer solutions for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Let's assume \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), the largest possible value for \(c\) is less than 300. Let's test some possible values for \(c\).

First, let's try \(c = 100\). Then \(a + b = 200\), and the equation becomes:

\[
a^2b + a^2 \cdot 100 + b^2a + b^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2a + 100^2b = 6,000,000.

Simplifying, we get:

\[
a^2b + 100a^2 + b^2a + 100b^2 + 10000a + 10000b = 6,000,000,

\[
a^2b + b^2a + 100a^2 + 100b^2 + 10000a + 10000b = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
ab(a + b) + 100(a^2 + b^2) + 10000(a + b) = 6,000,000.
\]

Since \(a + b = 200\), we substitute this in:

\[
ab \cdot 200 + 100(a^2 + b^2) + 10000 \cdot 200 = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
200ab + 100(a^2 + b^2) + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
200ab + 100(a^2 + b^2) = 4,000,000,
\]
\[
2ab + a^2 + b^2 = 40,000.
\]

We know that \(a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 200^2 - 2ab = 40,000 - 2ab\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
2ab + 40,000 - 2ab = 40,000,

\[
40,000 = 40,000.

This is true, so \(a + b = 200\) and \(c = 100\) is a valid solution. Now, we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a + b = 200\) and \(a \leq b\). Let's try \(a = 100\) and \(b = 100\):

\[
a = 100, \quad b = 100, \quad c = 100.

Then \(a + b + c = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300\) and:

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) respectively. The slope of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and the point \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
This is the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Point \(P\) is the intersection of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) with the \(x\)-axis, so we set \(y = 0\) in the equation of the line:
\[
0 = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies \sqrt{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of point \(P\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\).

Point \(Q\) is the intersection of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) with the \(y\)-axis, so we set \(x = 0\) in the equation of the line:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}(0) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of point \(Q\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).

The length of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[
PQ = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2} - 0\right)^2 + \left(0 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1
\]
Since \(\overline{PQ}\) is divided into four equal parts, each part has a length of:
\[
\frac{1}{4}
\]
Let the coordinates of point \(C\) be \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) is on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), it satisfies the equation \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). The distance from \(O\) to \(C\) is \(OC\), and we need to find \(OC^2\). Since \(C\) is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the way from \(P\) to \(Q\), the coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)
\]
Thus, the distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}

Therefore, \(OC^2\) is:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}

The values of \(p\) and \(q\) are 1 and 4, respectively. Thus, \(p + q\) is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

First, observe that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be factored as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).\]
We can substitute \(x = \omega^k\) into the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) to get:
\[\omega^{13k} - 1 = 0 \implies 1 - 1 = 0.\]
This tells us that \(\omega^k\) is a root of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) for each \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

Now, consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\). We can rewrite it as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).\]
The polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

Notice that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity, but it is not necessarily a primitive root. Specifically, \(\omega^{2k} = (\omega^2)^k\), and \(\omega^2\) is a primitive 13th root of unity if and only if \(\gcd(2, 13) = 1\), which is true. Therefore, the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) are also the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) when \(x\) is replaced by \(\omega^2\).

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) evaluated at \(\omega^k\) is zero for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Therefore, we can write:
\[x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(x - \omega^k).\]
Substituting \(x = 2 - \omega^k\) into this equation, we get:
\[2^{12} + 2^{11} + \cdots + 2 + 1 = \prod_{k=1}^{12}((2 - \omega^k) - \omega^k) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]
The left-hand side is a geometric series with the first term 1 and common ratio 2, so it sums to:
\[2^{12} + 2^{11} + \cdots + 2 + 1 = \frac{2^{13} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{13} - 1 = 8192 - 1 = 8191.\]
Therefore, we have:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 8191.\]
Since the product includes the term \(2 - 2\omega^0 + \omega^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1\) for \(k = 0\), we have:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot 8191 = 8191.\]
Finally, we need to find the remainder when 8191 is divided by 1000:
\[8191 \div 1000 = 8 \text{ remainder } 191.\]
Therefore, the remainder is:
\[\boxed{191}.\]","[191, '191']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest possible \(b\)-elegant number \(n\) such that \(n\) is a two-digit number in base \(b\) and the sum of its digits equals \(\sqrt{n}\). Let's denote the two-digit number in base \(b\) as \(ab + c\), where \(a\) and \(c\) are its digits, and \(1 \leq a < b\) and \(0 \leq c < b\). The condition for \(n\) to be \(b\)-elegant is:

\[a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}\]

First, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:

\[(a + c)^2 = ab + c\]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c\]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation in terms of \(a\) and \(c\):

\[a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0\]

To find the largest possible \(b\)-elegant number, we need to test values of \(b\) starting from the largest possible values and work our way down until we find a solution. Let's start with \(b = 100\):

If \(b = 100\), then \(n\) is a two-digit number in base 100, so \(1 \leq a < 100\) and \(0 \leq c < 100\). The equation becomes:

\[a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - 100a - c = 0\]

We need to find integer solutions for \(a\) and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's try \(a = 99\):

\[99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 \cdot c + c^2 - 100 \cdot 99 - c = 0\]
\[9801 + 198c + c^2 - 9900 - c = 0\]
\[c^2 + 197c - 99 = 0\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 197\), and \(c = -99\):

\[c = \frac{-197 \pm \sqrt{197^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-99)}}{2 \cdot 1}\]
\[c = \frac{-197 \pm \sqrt{38809 + 396}}{2}\]
\[c = \frac{-197 \pm \sqrt{39205}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{39205} \approx 197.95\), we get:

\[c = \frac{-197 + 197.95}{2} \approx 0.475\]
\[c = \frac{-197 - 197.95}{2} \approx -197.475\]

Since \(c\) must be an integer between 0 and 99, \(c = 0\) is the only feasible solution. Substituting \(c = 0\) back into the equation \(a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}\), we get:

\[99 + 0 = \sqrt{99 \cdot 100 + 0}\]
\[99 = \sqrt{9900}\]
\[99 = 99\]

This is a valid solution, so the largest possible \(b\)-elegant number is \(9900\) in base 100, which is \(99\) in base 10. Therefore, the largest possible value of \(b\) is:

"To determine the number of distinct parallelograms that can be formed in a 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) where each side of the parallelogram is either a side of the dodecagon or a diagonal that does not intersect any other side of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of parallelograms and the structure of the dodecagon.

A parallelogram is defined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a dodecagon, the sides are all equal in length, so the sides of the parallelogram must either be two sides of the dodecagon that are parallel or two diagonals that are parallel.

### Case 1: Parallelograms with sides as sides of the dodecagon
In a dodecagon, there are 12 sides. For a parallelogram to have all its sides as sides of the dodecagon, it must be a rectangle or a square. However, a square cannot be formed in a regular dodecagon because the side length of the square would not match the side length of the dodecagon. Therefore, we only consider rectangles.

A rectangle in a dodecagon can be formed by selecting two pairs of opposite sides. There are 6 pairs of opposite sides in a dodecagon. Thus, there are 6 possible rectangles.

### Case 2: Parallelograms with sides as diagonals of the dodecagon
For a parallelogram to have its sides as diagonals, the diagonals must be parallel. We need to count the number of pairs of parallel diagonals in the dodecagon.

#### Diagonals parallel to a side
Each side of the dodecagon is parallel to three other sides. For each side, there are three pairs of diagonals that are parallel to it. However, each pair is counted twice (once for each side), so we need to divide by 2. Therefore, the number of pairs of diagonals parallel to a side is:
\[
\frac{12 \times 3}{2} = 18
\]

#### Diagonals not parallel to a side
We need to count the diagonals that are not parallel to any side. The total number of diagonals in a dodecagon is given by:
\[
\frac{12 \times (12-3)}{2} = \frac{12 \times 9}{2} = 54
\]
Subtracting the number of diagonals parallel to a side, we get:
\[
54 - 18 = 36
\]
Each pair of these diagonals is parallel to each other. Therefore, the number of pairs of diagonals not parallel to a side is:
\[
\frac{36}{2} = 18
\]

### Total number of parallelograms
Adding the number of parallelograms from both cases, we get:
\[
6 + 18 + 18 = 42
\]

Thus, the number of distinct parallelograms that can be formed is:
\[
\boxed{42}

"Let's denote the three-digit number by \( n \). According to the problem, \( n \) has the following properties:
1. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is 30.
2. The number of distinct digits in \( n \) is 9.
3. The middle digit of \( n \) is not present in the other two digits.

Since \( n \) is a three-digit number, we can express it as \( n = 100a + 10b + c \), where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are its digits, and \( a \neq 0 \) because \( n \) is a three-digit number. The conditions given can be written as:
1. \( a + b + c = 30 \)
2. The digits \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are distinct.
3. The middle digit \( b \) is not equal to \( a \) or \( c \).

Since \( b \) is not equal to \( a \) or \( c \), and \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are distinct digits, the only possible values for \( b \) are those that are not equal to \( a \) or \( c \). Let's consider the possible values for \( b \) and see if we can find suitable values for \( a \) and \( c \).

If \( b = 9 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 9 = 21 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((2, 19)\), \((3, 18)\), \((4, 17)\), \((5, 16)\), \((6, 15)\), \((7, 14)\), \((8, 13)\), \((10, 11)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits (i.e., between 0 and 9), the only valid pair is \((8, 13)\), which is not valid because 13 is not a digit. Therefore, \( b \neq 9 \).

If \( b = 8 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 8 = 22 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((3, 19)\), \((4, 18)\), \((5, 17)\), \((6, 16)\), \((7, 15)\), \((8, 14)\), \((9, 13)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, the only valid pair is \((9, 13)\), which is not valid because 13 is not a digit. Therefore, \( b \neq 8 \).

If \( b = 7 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 7 = 23 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((4, 19)\), \((5, 18)\), \((6, 17)\), \((7, 16)\), \((8, 15)\), \((9, 14)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, the only valid pair is \((9, 14)\), which is not valid because 14 is not a digit. Therefore, \( b \neq 7 \).

If \( b = 6 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 6 = 24 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((5, 19)\), \((6, 18)\), \((7, 17)\), \((8, 16)\), \((9, 15)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, the only valid pair is \((9, 15)\), which is not valid because 15 is not a digit. Therefore, \( b \neq 6 \).

If \( b = 5 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 5 = 25 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((6, 19)\), \((7, 18)\), \((8, 17)\), \((9, 16)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, the only valid pair is \((9, 16)\), which is not valid because 16 is not a digit. Therefore, \( b \neq 5 \).

If \( b = 4 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 4 = 26 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((7, 19)\), \((8, 18)\), \((9, 17)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, the only valid pair is \((9, 17)\), which is not valid because 17 is not a digit. Therefore, \( b \neq 4 \).

If \( b = 3 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 3 = 27 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((8, 19)\), \((9, 18)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, the only valid pair is \((9, 18)\), which is not valid because 18 is not a digit. Therefore, \( b \neq 3 \).

If \( b = 2 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 2 = 28 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((9, 19)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, there are no valid pairs. Therefore, \( b \neq 2 \).

If \( b = 1 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 1 = 29 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((9, 20)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, there are no valid pairs. Therefore, \( b \neq 1 \).

If \( b = 0 \), then \( a + c = 30 - 0 = 30 \). The possible pairs \((a, c)\) are \((9, 21)\), but since \( a \) and \( c \) must be digits, there are no valid pairs. Therefore, \( b \neq 0 \).

Therefore, the only possible value for \( b \) is \( b = 6 \), and the only valid pair is \((9, 15)\), which is not valid because 15 is not a digit. Therefore, the only possible value for \( b \) is \( b = 6 \).

"To determine the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the digits in the top row is 999 and the sum of the digits in the bottom row is 99, we need to analyze the constraints and possible values for each digit.

First, let's consider the top row. The sum of the digits in the top row is 999. Since each digit is a single digit (0 through 9), the only way to achieve a sum of 999 is if each digit in the top row is 9. Therefore, the top row must be:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
9 & 9 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Next, let's consider the bottom row. The sum of the digits in the bottom row is 99. We need to find combinations of three digits that sum to 99. Since each digit is a single digit (0 through 9), the only way to achieve a sum of 99 is if two of the digits are 9 and the third digit is 9. Therefore, the bottom row must be:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
9 & 9 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

However, this contradicts the given condition that the sum of the digits in the bottom row is 99. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or constraints.

Given the constraints and the provided solution, it appears there may be additional information or constraints not explicitly stated. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the provided solution.

\[

\]
we start by expressing each equation in terms of logarithms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
\[
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2 y - \log_2 x - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2 z - \log_2 x - \log_2 y = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Let \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). The system of equations becomes:
\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}, \quad b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}, \quad c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
We add all three equations together:
\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
To add the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 12:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}.
\]
So,
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}.
\]
We need to find the value of \(| \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) |\). Using the properties of logarithms, we have:
\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c.
\]
We can express \(4a + 3b + 2c\) in terms of \(a + b + c\):
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 2(a + b + c) + (a + b + c) = 3(a + b + c).
\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 3 \left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) = -\frac{39}{12} = -\frac{13}{4}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4y^3z^2) \right| = \left| -\frac{13}{4} \right| = \frac{13}{4}.

\text{Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times (200 + 240) \times s = \frac{1}{2} \times 440 \times s = 220s
\]

For the trapezoid formed by extending \(EF\) and \(OA\), the bases are 300 and \(x\), and the height is \(s\). Therefore, the area of this trapezoid is:
\[
\text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (300 + x) \times s = \frac{1}{2} \times (300 + x) \times s = \frac{1}{2} \times (300s + xs) = 150s + \frac{1}{2}xs
\]

Since the trapezoids are congruent, their areas are equal. Therefore, we can set the areas equal to each other:
\[
220s = 150s + \frac{1}{2}xs
\]

To solve for \(x\), we first isolate the term involving \(x\):
\[
220s - 150s = \frac{1}{2}xs
\]
\[
70s = \frac{1}{2}xs
\]

Next, we eliminate \(s\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \(s \neq 0\)):
\[
70 = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

Then, we solve for \(x\) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
x = 140
\]

Thus, the side length of the square is \(\boxed{140}\).","[140, '140']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"Let's denote the set \( A \) as \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). The set \( B \) consists of all positive integers that are not in \( A \). According to the problem, the largest element in \( B \) is in \( A \). This implies that \( a_n \) is the largest element in \( B \), and thus \( a_n \) is the largest positive integer that is not in \( A \).

Since \( B \) contains all positive integers that are not in \( A \), the set \( B \) can be written as \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_n-1\} \). The number of elements in \( B \) is given as 2024. Therefore, we have:
\[
a_n - 1 = 2024 \implies a_n = 2025
\]
This means that \( A \) contains all integers from \( a_1 \) to \( 2025 \), and \( a_1 \) is the smallest positive integer in \( A \). Since \( A \) is a set of positive integers, the smallest possible value for \( a_1 \) is 1. Therefore, \( A = \{1, 2, \ldots, 2025\} \).

The sum of the elements in \( A \) is the sum of the first 2025 positive integers. The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
Substituting \( n = 2025 \) into the formula, we get:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{2025} i = \frac{2025 \cdot 2026}{2} = 2025 \cdot 1013 = 2051325
\]
Thus, the sum of the elements in \( A \) is:
\[
\boxed{2051325}

"Given that \( N \) is a four-digit number such that \( N + 1 \) is divisible by 7, we can express this as:
\[ N \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

We need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) that satisfies this condition. The largest four-digit number is 9999. We need to find the largest integer \( k \) such that:
\[ 9999 - k \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 9999 \equiv k + 6 \pmod{7} \]
First, we find the remainder when 9999 is divided by 7:
\[ 9999 \div 7 = 1428 \text{ remainder } 3 \]
So,
\[ 9999 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
This gives us:
\[ 3 \equiv k + 6 \pmod{7} \]
Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:
\[ k \equiv 3 - 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ k \equiv -3 \pmod{7} \]
Since \(-3\) is equivalent to \(4\) modulo 7 (because \(-3 + 7 = 4\)), we have:
\[ k \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
The largest integer \( k \) that is less than or equal to 9999 and satisfies this condition is:
\[ k = 7 \times 1428 - 3 = 9996 - 3 = 9993 \]
So, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is:
\[ N = 9993 - 6 = 9997 \]

Next, we need to find the remainder when 9997 is divided by 1000:
\[ 9997 \div 1000 = 9 \text{ remainder } 997 \]
So,
\[ 9997 \equiv 997 \pmod{1000} \]
This means that when 9997 is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 9 and the remainder \( R \) is 997. Therefore, \( Q + R \) is:
\[ Q + R = 9 + 997 = 1006 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1006} \]","[1006, '1006']",699,"[699, '699']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the two circles formed by the intersection of the sphere \( S \) with the plane \( T \) when \( T \) is tangent to the sphere from the inside and from the outside, respectively. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11 units.

First, let's consider the case when the plane \( T \) is tangent to the sphere from the inside. The distance from the center of the sphere to the plane \( T \) is equal to the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the circle of intersection. The radius of the circle of intersection is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
r_i = \sqrt{11^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{121 - 9} = \sqrt{112} = 4\sqrt{7}
\]

Next, let's consider the case when the plane \( T \) is tangent to the sphere from the outside. The distance from the center of the sphere to the plane \( T \) is equal to the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the circle of intersection. The radius of the circle of intersection is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
r_o = \sqrt{11^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{121 - 9} = \sqrt{112} = 4\sqrt{7}
\]

However, we need to re-evaluate the problem because the plane \( T \) is tangent to the sphere from the outside, but the radius of the circle of intersection should be different. Let's correct the approach.

The correct approach is to consider the correct distance from the center of the sphere to the plane \( T \) when the plane is tangent to the sphere from the outside. The distance from the center of the sphere to the plane \( T \) is equal to the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the circle of intersection. The radius of the circle of intersection is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
r_i = \sqrt{11^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{121 - 9} = \sqrt{112} = 4\sqrt{7}
\]

"To determine the number of ways to place 25 chipped pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chipped piece, we need to consider the problem as a permutation of the rows and columns.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a \(5 \times 5\) grid.
   - We need to place 25 chipped pieces such that each row and each column contains exactly one chipped piece.
   - This is equivalent to finding a permutation of the rows that corresponds to the columns.

2. **Permutations:**
   - A permutation of a set is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
   - For a \(5 \times 5\) grid, we need to find the number of permutations of 5 distinct elements (rows).

3. **Calculating the Number of Permutations:**
   - The number of permutations of \(n\) distinct elements is given by \(n!\) (n factorial).
   - For \(n = 5\):
     \[
     5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
     \]

4. **Performing the Multiplication:**
   \[
