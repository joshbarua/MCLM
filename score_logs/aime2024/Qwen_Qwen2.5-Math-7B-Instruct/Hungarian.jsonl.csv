"To determine how many minutes Aya takes to complete the race when she runs at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour, we start by analyzing the given information.

First, we know that when Aya runs at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour, the race takes her 4 hours, including the time \( t \) she spends in the coffee shop. Therefore, the time she spends running is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The total distance of the race is the product of her running speed and the time she spends running:
\[
9 = s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
9 = 4s - \frac{st}{60}
\]
Multiplying through by 60 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
540 = 240s - st
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
st = 240s - 540 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, we know that when Aya runs at a speed of \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the race takes her 2 hours 24 minutes, which is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours, including the time \( t \) she spends in the coffee shop. Therefore, the time she spends running is \( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The total distance of the race is the product of her running speed and the time she spends running:
\[
9 = (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60}
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st + 2t}{60}
\]
Multiplying through by 60 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
540 = 144s + 288 - st - 2t
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
st + 2t = 144s + 288 - 540
\]
Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
st + 2t = 144s - 252 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( st = 240s - 540 \)
2. \( st + 2t = 144s - 252 \)

Substituting the value of \( st \) from equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
\[
240s - 540 + 2t = 144s - 252
\]
Rearranging terms to isolate \( t \), we get:
\[
2t = 144s - 252 - 240s + 540
\]
Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
2t = -96s + 288
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
t = -48s + 144
\]

Now we substitute \( t = -48s + 144 \) back into equation (1) to find \( s \):
\[
s(-48s + 144) = 240s - 540
\]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-48s^2 + 144s = 240s - 540
\]
\[
-48s^2 + 144s - 240s + 540 = 0
\]
\[
-48s^2 - 96s + 540 = 0
\]
Dividing through by -12, we get:
\[
4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -45 \):
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-45)}}{2 \cdot 4}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-36}{8} = -4.5
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) kilometers per hour.

Now we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the expression for \( t \):
\[
t = -48(2.5) + 144
\]
\[
t = -120 + 144
\]
\[
t = 24
\]

Finally, we need to find the time it takes Aya to complete the race when she runs at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) kilometers per hour. The time she spends running is:
\[
4 - \frac{24}{60} = 4 - 0.4 = 3.6 \text{ hours}
\]
The time she spends in the coffee shop is \( t = 24 \) minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes her to complete the race is:
\[
3.6 \text{ hours} + \frac{24}{60} \text{ hours} = 3.6 + 0.4 = 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes Aya to complete the race is \(\boxed{240}\) minutes.","[240, '240']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for the length of \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with circumcircle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of the tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\). This power is also equal to \(DB^2 = DC^2\).

Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), \(D\) is the excenter of the triangle \(ABC\) opposite to \(A\). The power of point \(D\) can also be expressed as \(DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP\).

Next, we use the fact that \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) extended to the circumcircle. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
This implies that \(D\) divides the opposite side \(BC\) in the ratio \(1:2\). Therefore, \(BD = 3\) and \(DC = 6\).

Now, we use the power of point \(D\) again:
\[
DB^2 = DA \cdot DP \implies 3^2 = DA \cdot DP \implies 9 = DA \cdot DP
\]

To find \(DA\), we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle. The formula is:
\[
DA = \frac{2bc}{b+c} \cdot \cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)
\]
where \(b = AC = 10\), \(c = AB = 5\), and \(a = BC = 9\). First, we need to find \(\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\). Using the half-angle formula for cosine, we have:
\[
\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos A}{2}}
\]
To find \(\cos A\), we use the Law of Cosines:
\[
\cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} = \frac{10^2 + 5^2 - 9^2}{2 \cdot 10 \cdot 5} = \frac{100 + 25 - 81}{100} = \frac{44}{100} = \frac{11}{25}
\]
Substituting \(\cos A\) into the half-angle formula, we get:
\[
\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{11}{25}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{36}{25}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{36}{50}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{25}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{5}
\]
Now, we substitute \(\cos\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\) into the formula for \(DA\):
\[
DA = \frac{2 \cdot 10 \cdot 5}{10 + 5} \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{5} = \frac{100}{15} \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{5} = \frac{20}{3} \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{5} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]
Substituting \(DA = 4\sqrt{2}\) into the power of point equation, we get:
\[
9 = 4\sqrt{2} \cdot DP \implies DP = \frac{9}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{8}
\]
Since \(AD = 4\sqrt{2}\) and \(DP = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{8}\), we have:
\[
AP = AD - DP = 4\sqrt{2} - \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{8} = \frac{32\sqrt{2}}{8} - \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{8} = \frac{23\sqrt{2}}{8}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(AP\) is \(\frac{23\sqrt{2}}{8}\). Since \(m = 23\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 8\), and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime, we have \(m = 23\) and \(n = 8\). Thus, \(m + n = 23 + 8 = 31\).

"To determine the probability that a regular octagon can be rotated such that all the green vertices are in the positions where the original red vertices were, we need to consider the symmetries of the octagon. A regular octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°).

For the octagon to be rotated such that all the green vertices are in the positions where the original red vertices were, the rotation must be by an angle that is a multiple of 360°/8 = 45°. This means that the only possible rotations are 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°. However, the only rotation that will place all the green vertices in the positions of the original red vertices is the 0° rotation (i.e., no rotation at all).

Now, let's calculate the total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon. Since each vertex can be either red or green, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to determine how many of these colorings will result in the octagon being able to be rotated such that all the green vertices are in the positions where the original red vertices were. As we established, this can only happen if all the vertices are the same color (either all red or all green). There are 2 such colorings (all red or all green).

Therefore, the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the green vertices are in the positions where the original red vertices were is:
\[
\frac{2}{256} = \frac{1}{128}
\]

Since the fraction \(\frac{1}{128}\) is already in its simplest form, we have \(m = 1\) and \(n = 128\). Thus, \(m + n = 1 + 128 = 129\).

The final answer is:

"To determine the number of intersection points between the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and how they interact with the trigonometric functions \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \).

First, let's analyze the function \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \):
- For \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- For \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

Next, let's analyze the function \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \):
- For \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- For \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, consider the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) will range from \(0\) to \(1\).
- Specifically, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \) when \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), and \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \) when \( |\sin(2\pi x)| > \frac{1}{2} \).
- Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(2\).

Similarly, consider the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \):
- Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) will range from \(0\) to \(1\).
- Specifically, \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| \) when \( |\cos(3\pi y)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \) when \( |\cos(3\pi y)| > \frac{1}{2} \).
- Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will range from \(0\) to \(2\).

To find the intersection points, we need to solve the equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) simultaneously. Since both \( x \) and \( y \) range from \(0\) to \(2\), we can consider the behavior of the functions within this interval.

The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) is periodic with period \( \frac{1}{2} \) because \( \sin(2\pi x) \) is periodic with period \( \frac{1}{2} \). Similarly, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) is periodic with period \( \frac{2}{3} \) because \( \cos(3\pi y) \) is periodic with period \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The least common multiple of \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{2}{3} \) is \( 1 \). Therefore, the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) will intersect \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) times in the interval \( [0, 2] \).

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). We also need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the smallest prime number, which is \( p = 2 \). We need to check if there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \). We can check the values of \( n \) modulo 4:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).

In none of these cases, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 4. Therefore, \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

Next, let's consider the next smallest prime number, which is \( p = 5 \). We need to check if there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \). We can check the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 7 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 7 \pmod{25} \).

None of these values are divisible by 25. However, we need to check if there exists a \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). We can use the fact that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{25} \). By checking the values of \( n \) modulo 25, we find that \( n \equiv 7 \pmod{25} \) or \( n \equiv 18 \pmod{25} \) satisfy this condition. Therefore, \( p = 5 \) is a solution.

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \). We can check the values of \( m \) modulo 25:
- If \( m \equiv 7 \pmod{25} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 7^4 + 1 \equiv 2401 + 1 \equiv 2402 \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( m \equiv 18 \pmod{25} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 18^4 + 1 \equiv 104976 + 1 \equiv 104977 \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \).

We need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). We can use the fact that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{25} \). By checking the values of \( m \) modulo 25, we find that \( m \equiv 7 \pmod{25} \) or \( m \equiv 18 \pmod{25} \). Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( m \) is \( m = 7 \).

"To find the distance from the point \( I \) inside the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its faces, we need to use the concept of the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of its faces. The point \( I \) is the incenter of the tetrahedron, and the distance from the incenter to any face is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}
\]

where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 \) are the areas of the faces.

First, we calculate the area of each face using Heron's formula. For a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), the area \( A \) is given by:

\[
A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \).

**Face \( \triangle ABC \):**
- \( a = \sqrt{41} \)
- \( b = \sqrt{80} \)
- \( c = \sqrt{89} \)
- \( s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \)

\[
A_1 = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} - \sqrt{41} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} - \sqrt{80} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} - \sqrt{89} \right)}
\]

This calculation is quite complex, so we will use the fact that the areas of the faces are equal due to the symmetry of the tetrahedron. We can find the volume \( V \) using the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a, b, c, d, e, f \):

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = \sqrt{41} \), \( e = \sqrt{80} \), and \( f = \sqrt{89} \):

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 41 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 41 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating this determinant, we find:

\[
288 V^2 = 288 \cdot 360
\]

\[
V^2 = 360
\]

\[
V = \sqrt{360} = 6\sqrt{10}
\]

Next, we calculate the area of one face. Using Heron's formula for \( \triangle ABC \):

\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

We approximate the semi-perimeter and then use it to find the area. However, since we know the areas are equal and the tetrahedron is symmetric, we can use the fact that the area of each face is:

\[
A_1 = A_2 = A_3 = A_4 = \sqrt{360} = 6\sqrt{10}
\]

Now, we find the distance \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4} = \frac{3 \cdot 6\sqrt{10}}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{10}} = \frac{18\sqrt{10}}{24\sqrt{10}} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Thus, the distance from the point \( I \) to each face is \( \frac{3\sqrt{10}}{4} \). Therefore, \( m = 3 \), \( n = 10 \), and \( p = 4 \).

Finally, we find \( m + n + p \):

\[
m + n + p = 3 + 10 + 4 = 17

"Given a rectangular prism with surface area \(54\) and volume \(23\), we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain all such prisms. The surface area \(A\) and volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are given by:
\[ A = 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \]
\[ V = abc = 23 \]

The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the prism is half the length of the space diagonal of the prism. The length of the space diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]
Thus, the radius \(r\) is:
\[ r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2} \]
We need to find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\). Using the identity:
\[ (a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \]
we can substitute \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\):
\[ (a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54 \]
Therefore:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54 \]

To find \(a+b+c\), we use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0 \]
Substituting the known values \(ab + bc + ca = 27\) and \(abc = 23\), we get:
\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0 \]

We need to find the possible values of \(a+b+c\). By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots of the polynomial are the factors of \(-23\), which are \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm 23\). Testing these values, we find:
For \(t = 1\):
\[ 1^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot 1^2 + 27 \cdot 1 - 23 = 1 - (a+b+c) + 27 - 23 = 5 - (a+b+c) \]
This is zero if \(a+b+c = 5\).

For \(t = -1\):
\[ (-1)^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot (-1)^2 + 27 \cdot (-1) - 23 = -1 - (a+b+c) - 27 - 23 = -51 - (a+b+c) \]
This is not zero.

For \(t = 23\):
\[ 23^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot 23^2 + 27 \cdot 23 - 23 = 12167 - (a+b+c) \cdot 529 + 621 - 23 = 12765 - (a+b+c) \cdot 529 \]
This is not zero.

For \(t = -23\):
\[ (-23)^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot (-23)^2 + 27 \cdot (-23) - 23 = -12167 - (a+b+c) \cdot 529 - 621 - 23 = -12811 - (a+b+c) \cdot 529 \]
This is not zero.

Thus, the only rational root is \(a+b+c = 5\). Therefore:

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each logarithmic expression.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ x \log_x(y) = 10. \]
By the change of base formula, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), so the equation becomes:
\[ x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\log(x)\), we get:
\[ x \log(y) = 10 \log(x). \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}. \]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ 4y \log_y(x) = 10. \]
By the change of base formula, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), so the equation becomes:
\[ 4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(\log(y)\), we get:
\[ 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y). \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}. \]

Now we have two equations:
\[ \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}, \]
\[ \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}. \]

Multiplying these two equations together, we get:
\[ \left(\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\right) \left(\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\right) = \left(\frac{10}{x}\right) \left(\frac{5}{2y}\right). \]
The left side simplifies to 1, so we have:
\[ 1 = \frac{50}{2xy}. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(2xy\), we get:
\[ 2xy = 50. \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we find:
\[ xy = 25. \]

"To determine the values of \( n \) for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the positions that are winning or losing. A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position if the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Let's start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If \( n = 0 \), the player whose turn it is loses because there are no zseton left.
- If \( n = 1 \), the player whose turn it is wins by taking the last zseton.
- If \( n = 2 \), the player whose turn it is loses because they can only take 1 zseton, leaving 1 zseton for the opponent, who then wins.
- If \( n = 3 \), the player whose turn it is wins by taking 1 zseton, leaving 2 zseton for the opponent, who then loses.
- If \( n = 4 \), the player whose turn it is wins by taking all 4 zseton.
- If \( n = 5 \), the player whose turn it is loses because they can only take 1 zseton, leaving 4 zseton for the opponent, who then wins, or they can take 4 zseton, leaving 1 zseton for the opponent, who then wins.
- If \( n = 6 \), the player whose turn it is wins by taking 1 zseton, leaving 5 zseton for the opponent, who then loses.
- If \( n = 7 \), the player whose turn it is wins by taking 4 zseton, leaving 3 zseton for the opponent, who then loses.
- If \( n = 8 \), the player whose turn it is loses because they can only take 1 zseton, leaving 7 zseton for the opponent, who then wins, or they can take 4 zseton, leaving 4 zseton for the opponent, who then wins.

From this pattern, we can see that the losing positions are \( n = 2, 5, 8, \ldots \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and common difference 3. The general form of the \( k \)-th term of this sequence is:
\[ n = 2 + 3k \]

We need to find all values of \( n \) that are less than or equal to 2024 and are of the form \( 2 + 3k \). To do this, we solve the inequality:
\[ 2 + 3k \leq 2024 \]
\[ 3k \leq 2022 \]
\[ k \leq 674 \]

Since \( k \) is a non-negative integer, \( k \) can take any integer value from 0 to 674, inclusive. Therefore, there are 675 possible values of \( k \), and hence 675 values of \( n \) that are less than or equal to 2024 and are losing positions for Alice.

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) that are less than or equal to 2024 and for which Bob has a winning strategy is:

"To determine the probability that Jen megnyeri the top prize given that she wins a prize, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10:**
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \frac{10!}{4! \cdot 6!} = 210
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the top prize:**
   Jen wins the top prize if all 4 numbers she chooses are among the 4 numbers drawn. There is only 1 way to choose all 4 numbers from the 4 numbers drawn:
   \[
   \binom{4}{4} = 1
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize:**
   Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of the 4 numbers she chooses are among the 4 numbers drawn. We will use the principle of complementary counting to find this.

   - **Calculate the number of ways Jen can win no prize:**
     Jen wins no prize if none of the 4 numbers she chooses are among the 4 numbers drawn. This means she chooses all 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers:
     \[
     \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = 15
     \]

   - **Calculate the number of ways Jen can win at least 1 prize:**
     Subtract the number of ways she wins no prize from the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers:
     \[
     210 - 15 = 195
     \]

4. **Calculate the conditional probability that Jen wins the top prize given that she wins a prize:**
   The conditional probability is the ratio of the number of ways she wins the top prize to the number of ways she wins a prize:
   \[
   P(\text{top prize} \mid \text{prize}) = \frac{\text{Number of ways to win top prize}}{\text{Number of ways to win prize}} = \frac{1}{195}

5. **Determine \( m \) and \( n \) and find \( m+n \):**
   The fraction \(\frac{1}{195}\) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 195 \). Therefore:

"Given the rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) such that points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and points \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, we need to find the length of \(CE\). We are given the following dimensions: \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

First, let's denote the coordinates of the points. Assume \(D\) is at \((0, 0)\), \(C\) is at \((a, 0)\), \(E\) is at \((a, b)\), and \(F\) is at \((a, b+c)\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) and \(F\) have the same x-coordinate as \(C\).

The length of \(BC\) is the height of rectangle \(ABCD\), so \(b = 16\). The length of \(AB\) is the width of rectangle \(ABCD\), so \(a = 107\). The length of \(FG\) is the height of rectangle \(EFGH\), so \(c = 17\). The length of \(EF\) is the sum of the heights of rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\), so \(b + c = 16 + 17 = 33\).

Since points \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is a cyclic quadrilateral. The coordinates of \(A\) are \((-107, 16)\), \(D\) are \((0, 0)\), \(H\) are \((a, b+c) = (107, 33)\), and \(G\) are \((a, c) = (107, 17)\).

For a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). We can use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals that the product of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides. The diagonals of quadrilateral \(ADHG\) are \(AH\) and \(DG\).

The length of \(AH\) is:
\[
AH = \sqrt{(107 - (-107))^2 + (33 - 16)^2} = \sqrt{214^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{45796 + 289} = \sqrt{46085}
\]

The length of \(DG\) is:
\[
DG = \sqrt{(107 - 0)^2 + (17 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 289} = \sqrt{11738}
\]

The length of \(AD\) is:
\[
AD = \sqrt{(0 - (-107))^2 + (0 - 16)^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 256} = \sqrt{11705}
\]

The length of \(HG\) is:
\[
HG = \sqrt{(107 - 107)^2 + (33 - 17)^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{256} = 16
\]

According to the property of cyclic quadrilaterals:
\[
AH \cdot DG = AD \cdot HG + AG \cdot HD
\]

Since \(AG = 16\) and \(HD = 16\), we have:
\[
\sqrt{46085} \cdot \sqrt{11738} = \sqrt{11705} \cdot 16 + 16 \cdot 16
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\sqrt{46085} \cdot \sqrt{11738} = 16(\sqrt{11705} + 16)

We need to find the length of \(CE\), which is \(b + c = 33\). Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To determine the number of paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to analyze the structure of such paths. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, and we need to find the number of ways to arrange these moves such that the direction changes exactly four times.

A direction change occurs when an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R. If there are exactly four direction changes, then there must be four R's followed by U's and four U's followed by R's. This means that the path must start with either an R or a U and alternate directions four times.

Let's consider the two cases separately:

1. **Case 1: The path starts with an R.**
   - The path will be in the form RURURURU.
   - There are 4 R's and 4 U's, and they are fixed in this order.
   - The number of ways to arrange 4 R's and 4 U's in this specific order is 1.

   - There are 4 R's and 4 U's, and they are fixed in this order.
   - The number of ways to arrange 4 R's and 4 U's in this specific order is 1.

Since there are only two possible forms for the path (RURURURU and URURURUR), the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is the sum of the number of paths in each case:

Therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is \(\boxed{70}\).","[70, '70']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"Given the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) and the condition \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the maximum possible real part of this expression.

First, let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:
\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
We can expand this using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\):
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]
Distribute the terms:
\[

\]
Combine like terms:
\[

Group the real and imaginary parts:
\[
(4 \cdot 75\cos\theta - 4 \cdot 117\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(4 \cdot 75\sin\theta + 4 \cdot 117\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta).
\]
Simplify the real part:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

We need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, and its maximum value is the amplitude of the resulting wave, which is given by:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the incircle of the triangle \(ABC\) given the conditions about the arrangement of the circles.

First, let's analyze the arrangement of the circles. We have 34 sugarú kör ériskező egymással sorban, and two kör érisi az \(AB\) és \(BC\) oldalakat. This means that the centers of these 34 circles form a straight line parallel to \(AC\), and the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is 2 (since each circle has a radius of 1).

The total length of this line segment is \(34 \times 2 = 68\). This line segment is parallel to \(AC\) and is at a distance of 1 unit from \(AC\) (since the radius of each circle is 1).

Now, let's consider the two circles that are tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\). The distance from the center of each of these circles to the point of tangency on \(AB\) or \(BC\) is 1 unit. Therefore, the distance from the center of each of these circles to the line segment parallel to \(AC\) is 1 unit.

This means that the distance from the line segment parallel to \(AC\) to \(AB\) or \(BC\) is 1 unit. Since the line segment is parallel to \(AC\) and is at a distance of 1 unit from \(AC\), the distance from \(AB\) or \(BC\) to \(AC\) is \(1 + 1 = 2\) units.

Thus, the height of the triangle \(ABC\) is 2 units. The base of the triangle is the length of \(AC\), which is 68 units.

The area \(A\) of the triangle \(ABC\) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 \times 2 = 68
\]

The semi-perimeter \(s\) of the triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2}
\]

Since the height from \(B\) to \(AC\) is 2 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of \(AB\) and \(BC\). Let \(D\) be the foot of the perpendicular from \(B\) to \(AC\). Then \(AD = x\) and \(DC = 68 - x\), and we have:
\[
AB = \sqrt{x^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 4}
\]
\[
BC = \sqrt{(68 - x)^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{(68 - x)^2 + 4}
\]

The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + \sqrt{(68 - x)^2 + 4} + 68}{2}
\]

The radius \(r\) of the incircle is given by the formula:
\[
r = \frac{A}{s} = \frac{68}{\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + \sqrt{(68 - x)^2 + 4} + 68}{2}} = \frac{136}{\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + \sqrt{(68 - x)^2 + 4} + 68}
\]

To find the value of \(r\), we need to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + \sqrt{(68 - x)^2 + 4}\) is symmetric and can be simplified using the fact that the sum of the distances from any point on a line segment to two fixed points is constant. In this case, the sum of the distances from \(B\) to \(A\) and \(B\) to \(C\) is constant and equal to the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with base 68 and height 2.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 4} + \sqrt{(68 - x)^2 + 4} = \sqrt{68^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{4624 + 4} = \sqrt{4628} = 2\sqrt{1157}
\]

Therefore, the semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{2\sqrt{1157} + 68}{2} = \sqrt{1157} + 34
\]

The radius \(r\) is:
\[
r = \frac{68}{\sqrt{1157} + 34}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
r = \frac{68(\sqrt{1157} - 34)}{(\sqrt{1157} + 34)(\sqrt{1157} - 34)} = \frac{68(\sqrt{1157} - 34)}{1157 - 1156} = \frac{68(\sqrt{1157} - 34)}{1} = 68(\sqrt{1157} - 34)
\]

Since \(\sqrt{1157} = 34\), we have:
\[
r = 68(34 - 34) = 68 \times 0 = 0
\]

Therefore, the radius of the incircle is:
\[
r = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the radius of the incircle is \(\frac{1}{2}\), and \(m = 1\) and \(n = 2\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 2 = 3\).

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the largest real number less than \(BD^2\) for any rhombus \(ABCD\) with vertices on the hyperbola and diagonals intersecting at the origin.

First, note that since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, if \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), then \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\) and if \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), then \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\).

Since \(B\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1
\]
We can express \(y_2^2\) in terms of \(x_2^2\) from this equation:
\[
y_2^2 = 24\left(\frac{x_2^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24x_2^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6x_2^2}{5} - 24
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_2^2 + \frac{6x_2^2}{5} - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{5x_2^2 + 6x_2^2}{5} - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11x_2^2}{5} - 24\right) = \frac{44x_2^2}{5} - 96
\]
To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we need to determine the minimum value of \(x_2^2\). Since \(x_2^2\) is a non-negative real number, the minimum value of \(x_2^2\) is 0. However, if \(x_2^2 = 0\), then \(y_2^2 = -24\), which is not possible since \(y_2^2\) must be non-negative. Therefore, \(x_2^2\) must be greater than 20 (the minimum value of \(x_2^2\) on the hyperbola).

The minimum value of \(x_2^2\) on the hyperbola is 20. Substituting \(x_2^2 = 20\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44 \cdot 20}{5} - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80
\]
Thus, the largest real number less than \(BD^2\) for any rhombus \(ABCD\) is:

"Let's define the following sets:
- \( A \) is the set of people who have a garden.
- \( B \) is the set of people who have a golf course.
- \( C \) is the set of people who have a swimming pool.
- \( D \) is the set of people who have a garden club.

We are given the following information:
- \( |A| = 195 \)
- \( |B| = 367 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- \( |D| = 900 \)
- The number of people who have exactly two of these items is 437.
- The number of people who have exactly three of these items is 234.
- Everyone has a garden club, so \( |D| = 900 \).

We need to find the number of people who have all four items, i.e., \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, we have:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
Since everyone has a garden club, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) + |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 900 = 1224
\]
Let \( x \) be the number of people who have all four items. Then the number of people who have exactly two items is the sum of the intersections of two sets minus three times the intersection of all four sets, and the number of people who have exactly three items is the sum of the intersections of three sets minus four times the intersection of all four sets. Therefore, we have:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3x = 437
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4x = 234
\]
Substituting these into the previous equation, we get:
\[
437 + 3x - (234 + 4x) + x = 1224
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
437 + 3x - 234 - 4x + x = 1224

\[
203 = 1224

\[
203 = 1224 - 2x
\]
\[
2x = 1224 - 203

\[

Therefore, the number of people who have all four items is \(\boxed{203}\).","[203, '203']",73,"[73, '73']",False
"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the value of \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OIA = 90^\circ \). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
\[
IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2
\]
We know that \( OA = R = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \), so:
\[
IA^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2 = 13^2
\]
\[
IA^2 + 13 = 169
\]
\[
IA^2 = 156
\]
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

Next, we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector \( IA \) in terms of the sides of the triangle:
\[
IA^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), \( c = AB \). The semiperimeter \( s \) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
We also know that the area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius \( r \) and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = 6s
\]
The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed using the circumradius \( R \) and the sides of the triangle:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
\[
abc = 312s
\]

Now, substitute \( IA^2 = 2\sqrt{39} \) into the angle bisector formula:
\[
(2\sqrt{39})^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
\[
156 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
\[
156s = bc(s-a)
\]
\[
bc = \frac{156s}{s-a}
\]

We need to find \( AB \cdot AC = bc \). From the equation \( abc = 312s \), we can express \( a \) in terms of \( b \) and \( c \):
\[
a = \frac{312s}{bc}
\]
Substitute this into the equation \( bc = \frac{156s}{s-a} \):
\[
bc = \frac{156s}{s - \frac{312s}{bc}}
\]
\[
bc = \frac{156s \cdot bc}{bc - 312s}
\]
\[
bc(bc - 312s) = 156s \cdot bc
\]
\[
bc^2 - 312sbc = 156sbc
\]
\[
bc^2 = 468sbc
\]
\[
bc = 468s
\]

Since \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), we substitute \( a = \frac{312s}{bc} \) into \( s \):
\[
s = \frac{\frac{312s}{bc} + b + c}{2}
\]
\[
2s = \frac{312s}{bc} + b + c
\]
\[
2sbc = 312s + bc(b + c)
\]
\[
2sbc = 312s + b^2c + bc^2
\]
\[
2sbc = 312s + bc(b + c)
\]
\[
bc = 468s
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
bc = 468s

Therefore, the value of \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[a + b + c = 300\]
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]

We can rewrite the second equation using the identity:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the identity, we get:
\[6,000,000 = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we obtain:
\[2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]

Now, let's consider the possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). If any two of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are equal, say \(a = b\), then the equation simplifies. Let's assume \(a = b\). Then we have:
\[2a + c = 300 \implies c = 300 - 2a.\]

Substituting \(a = b\) and \(c = 300 - 2a\) into the second equation, we get:
\[a^2a + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^2a + a(300 - 2a)^2 + (300 - 2a)a^2 + (300 - 2a)^2a = 6,000,000.\]
\[a^3 + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^3 + a(300 - 2a)^2 + a^3(300 - 2a) + a(300 - 2a)^2 = 6,000,000.\]
\[3a^3 + 2a^2(300 - 2a) + 2a(300 - 2a)^2 = 6,000,000.\]
\[3a^3 + 600a^2 - 4a^3 + 2a(90000 - 1200a + 4a^2) = 6,000,000.\]
\[-a^3 + 600a^2 + 180000a - 2400a^2 + 8a^3 = 6,000,000.\]
\[7a^3 - 1800a^2 + 180000a = 6,000,000.\]
\[a^3 - 257a^2 + 25700a = 857142.857.\]

By trial and error, we find that \(a = 100\) is a solution:
\[100^3 - 257 \cdot 100^2 + 25700 \cdot 100 = 1000000 - 2570000 + 2570000 = 1000000.\]

So, if \(a = 100\), then \(b = 100\) and \(c = 300 - 2 \cdot 100 = 100\). Therefore, the only solution is \((100, 100, 100)\).

Since the equation is symmetric, the permutations of \((100, 100, 100)\) are the only solutions. There is only one such permutation.

Thus, the number of such ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the coordinates of point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) can be found using the two-point form of the equation of a line:

\[
y - 0 = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Simplifying the slope, we get:

\[
y = -\sqrt{3} \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

So, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:

\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Let the coordinates of point \(C\) be \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) lies on \(\overline{AB}\), we have:

\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

We need to find the point \(C\) such that the distance from \(C\) to the \(x\)-axis and the distance from \(C\) to the \(y\)-axis are not equal to the length of any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in the family \(\mathcal{F}\). The length of any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1, where \(P = (a, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, b)\). The distance from \(C\) to the \(x\)-axis is \(y\) and the distance from \(C\) to the \(y\)-axis is \(x\). Therefore, we need:

\[
x \neq y \quad \text{and} \quad x^2 + y^2 \neq 1
\]

Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\), we get:

\[
x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1

Expanding and simplifying, we have:

\[
x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1

\[
4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1

Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fraction, we get:

\[
16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4
\]

\[
16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\):

\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]

Since \(C\) is in the first quadrant, we take the positive root:

\[
x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]

Substituting \(x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\) back into the equation \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we get:

\[
y = -\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]

The coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is given by:

\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring \(OC\), we get:

\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2}{64}
\]

Expanding the squares, we have:

\[
(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 = 9 + 6\sqrt{13} + 13 = 22 + 6\sqrt{13}
\]

\[
(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2 = 3 - 2\sqrt{117} + 39 = 42 - 2\sqrt{117}
\]

Adding these together, we get:

\[
(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2 = 22 + 6\sqrt{13} + 42 - 2\sqrt{117} = 64

However, we need to check if \(C\) is not on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in the family \(\mathcal{F}\). Since \(C\) is not on the line \(x = y\), it is not on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) where \(P\) and \(Q\) are on the axes. Therefore, the correct value of \(OC^2\) is:

\[
OC^2 = \frac{13}{16}

"To determine the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) has roots \(\omega^0, \omega^1, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We can factorize this polynomial as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).
\]
We are interested in the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at the roots of \(x^{13} - 1\) except at \(x = 1\). Therefore, we need to find:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) = P(1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k).
\]
First, we evaluate \(P(1)\):
\[
P(1) = 2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 1.
\]
So, we need to find \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\). Notice that:
\[
P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 = \frac{x^4 + 1}{x^2 + 1}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} \frac{\omega^{4k} + 1}{\omega^{2k} + 1}.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k) = \frac{\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^{4k} + 1)}{\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^{2k} + 1)}.
\]
We know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{4k} = \omega^{4k \mod 13}\). The exponents \(4k \mod 13\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) are a permutation of \(4, 8, 12, 3, 7, 11, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10\). Therefore, the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^{4k} + 1)\) is the same as \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k + 1)\). This means:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k) = \frac{\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k + 1)}{\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k + 1)} = 1.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1.

Therefore, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is:

"To find the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-elegant numbers, we need to analyze the conditions given. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant if it is a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-elegant is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{ab + c} \]

Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \]
\[ a^2 + c(2a - 1) + c^2 - ab = 0 \]

Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[ a^2 - ab + c(2a - 1) + c^2 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + c(2a - 1) + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]

For \( c \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant \(\Delta\) is given by:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (a^2 - ab) \]
\[ \Delta = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab \]
\[ \Delta = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]
\[ \Delta = 4a(b - 1) + 1 \]

For \(\Delta\) to be a perfect square, \( 4a(b - 1) + 1 \) must be a perfect square. Let \( 4a(b - 1) + 1 = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \). Then:
\[ k^2 - 1 = 4a(b - 1) \]
\[ (k - 1)(k + 1) = 4a(b - 1) \]

Since \( k - 1 \) and \( k + 1 \) are consecutive even numbers (if \( k \) is odd) or consecutive odd numbers (if \( k \) is even), one of them must be divisible by 4. Therefore, \( 4a(b - 1) \) must be even, which is always true since \( 4a \) is even.

"To determine the number of rectangular shapes that can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle is either an edge or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the possible configurations of the rectangle's sides.

A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. Let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.

### Step 1: Identify the possible side lengths of the rectangle
The side lengths of the rectangle can be either:
1. Two adjacent edges of the dodecagon.
2. Two diagonals of the dodecagon.

### Step 2: Count the number of ways to choose two adjacent edges
There are 12 edges in the dodecagon, and each edge can form a rectangle with the next edge. Therefore, there are 12 possible rectangles formed by two adjacent edges.

### Step 3: Count the number of ways to choose two diagonals
We need to consider the different types of diagonals in a dodecagon:
- **Short diagonals**: These connect vertices that are 2 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_3 \)).
- **Medium diagonals**: These connect vertices that are 3 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_4 \)).
- **Long diagonals**: These connect vertices that are 4 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_5 \)).
- ** very long diagonals**: These connect vertices that are 5 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_6 \)).

#### Short diagonals
There are 12 short diagonals. Each pair of adjacent short diagonals forms a rectangle. Since there are 12 short diagonals, we can choose 2 adjacent short diagonals in 6 ways (e.g., \( A_1A_3 \) and \( A_3A_5 \), \( A_2A_4 \) and \( A_4A_6 \), etc.).

#### Medium diagonals
There are 12 medium diagonals. Each pair of adjacent medium diagonals forms a rectangle. Since there are 12 medium diagonals, we can choose 2 adjacent medium diagonals in 6 ways (e.g., \( A_1A_4 \) and \( A_4A_7 \), \( A_2A_5 \) and \( A_5A_8 \), etc.).

#### Long diagonals
There are 6 long diagonals. Each pair of adjacent long diagonals forms a rectangle. Since there are 6 long diagonals, we can choose 2 adjacent long diagonals in 3 ways (e.g., \( A_1A_5 \) and \( A_5A_9 \), \( A_2A_6 \) and \( A_6A_{10} \), \( A_3A_7 \) and \( A_7A_{11} \)).

#### Very long diagonals
There are 6 very long diagonals. Each pair of adjacent very long diagonals forms a rectangle. Since there are 6 very long diagonals, we can choose 2 adjacent very long diagonals in 3 ways (e.g., \( A_1A_6 \) and \( A_6A_{11} \), \( A_2A_7 \) and \( A_7A_{12} \), \( A_3A_8 \) and \( A_8A_1 \)).

### Step 4: Sum the number of rectangles
Adding up all the possible rectangles formed by adjacent edges and diagonals, we get:
\[
12 \text{ (adjacent edges)} + 6 \text{ (short diagonals)} + 6 \text{ (medium diagonals)} + 3 \text{ (long diagonals)} + 3 \text{ (very long diagonals)} = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of rectangular shapes that can be formed is \(\boxed{30}\).","[30, '30']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"Given the conditions of the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfies the following properties:
1. The sum of the elements is 30.
2. The mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Let's denote the list by \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\). Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's assume that 9 appears \(k\) times. The median of the list is the middle number when the list is ordered. If \(n\) is odd, the median is \(a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\), and if \(n\) is even, the median is \(\frac{a_{\frac{n}{2}} + a_{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2}\).

Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, \(n\) must be odd (otherwise, the median would be the average of two numbers in the list, which could be a number that appears in the list). Let's assume \(n = 2m + 1\). Then the median is \(a_{m+1}\), and \(a_{m+1} \neq 9\).

Let's start by assuming the simplest case where \(k = 3\) (the smallest odd number greater than 1, since if \(k = 1\), 9 would be the mode but would also appear in the list). Then the list can be written as \(9, 9, 9, a_4, a_5, \ldots, a_{2m+1}\), where \(a_{m+1} \neq 9\). The sum of the elements is:
\[9 + 9 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots + a_{2m+1} = 30.\]
This simplifies to:
\[27 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots + a_{2m+1} = 30,\]
so:
\[a_4 + a_5 + \cdots + a_{2m+1} = 3.\]
Since \(a_{m+1}\) is the median and does not equal 9, it must be one of the numbers \(a_4, a_5, \ldots, a_{2m+1}\). The only way to satisfy the equation \(a_4 + a_5 + \cdots + a_{2m+1} = 3\) with positive integers is if \(a_{m+1} = 1\) and the other numbers are 1 and 1 (since \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\)). Therefore, the list is \(9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1\), but this list has only 6 elements, which is not odd. So, \(k = 3\) is not possible.

Next, let's assume \(k = 5\). Then the list can be written as \(9, 9, 9, 9, 9, a_7, a_8, \ldots, a_{2m+1}\), where \(a_{m+1} \neq 9\). The sum of the elements is:
\[9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_7 + a_8 + \cdots + a_{2m+1} = 30.\]
This simplifies to:
\[45 + a_7 + a_8 + \cdots + a_{2m+1} = 30,\]
which is not possible since 45 is already greater than 30. So, \(k = 5\) is not possible.

Next, let's assume \(k = 1\). Then the list can be written as \(9, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{2m+1}\), where \(a_{m+1} \neq 9\). The sum of the elements is:
\[9 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_{2m+1} = 30.\]
This simplifies to:
\[a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_{2m+1} = 21.\]
Since \(a_{m+1}\) is the median and does not equal 9, it must be one of the numbers \(a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{2m+1}\). The simplest case is if \(a_{m+1} = 1\), and the other numbers are 1 and 1 (since \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7\)). Therefore, the list is \(9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\), but this list has only 7 elements, which is odd. The median is 1, which does not appear in the list. The sum of the squares of the elements is:
\[9^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 81 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 87.\]
Therefore, the list of all elements' squares is \(\boxed{87}\).","[87, '87']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ways we can fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers read from left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers read from top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
The condition given is that the sum of the two numbers read from left to right is 999, which means:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
This equation tells us that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\). Similarly, the condition given for the sum of the three numbers read from top to bottom is:
\[
a + b + c + d + e + f = 99
\]
Since \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\), we have:
\[
(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27
\]
However, the problem states that the sum of all six digits is 99, which is a contradiction unless we interpret the problem correctly. Let's recheck the problem statement and the example given. The example provided is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Here, the sum of the two numbers read from left to right is \(008 + 991 = 999\), and the sum of the three numbers read from top to bottom is \(0 + 0 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 27\), which is not 99. This indicates a misinterpretation. Let's recheck the problem statement again.

"We start with the given system of logarithmic equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
We can rewrite these equations using the properties of logarithms:
\[
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2 y - \log_2 x - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2 z - \log_2 x - \log_2 y = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Let's denote \(\log_2 x = a\), \(\log_2 y = b\), and \(\log_2 z = c\). The system of equations becomes:
\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}, \quad b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}, \quad c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
We can add all three equations together:
\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
To add the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 12:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}.
\]
So,
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}.
\]
We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\). Using the properties of logarithms, we have:
\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z = 4a + 3b + 2c.
\]
We can express \(4a + 3b + 2c\) in terms of \(a + b + c\):
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 2(a + b + c) + (2a + b).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the original equations to find specific values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(a - b - c) - (b - a - c) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3},
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
2a - 2b = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]
So,
\[
a - b = \frac{1}{12}.
\]
Subtract the third equation from the second:
\[
(b - a - c) - (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4},
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
2b - 2c = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}.
\]
So,
\[
b - c = \frac{1}{24}.
\]
Subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
(c - a - b) - (a - b - c) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2},
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
2c - 2a = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{2}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}.
\]
So,
\[
c - a = -\frac{1}{8}.
\]
We now have the system:
\[
a - b = \frac{1}{12}, \quad b - c = \frac{1}{24}, \quad c - a = -\frac{1}{8}.
\]
Adding these three equations together, we get:
\[
(a - b) + (b - c) + (c - a) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{8}.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
0 = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{8}.
\]
To add the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 24:
\[
\frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{24}, \quad \frac{1}{24} = \frac{1}{24}, \quad \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{24}.
\]
So,
\[
\frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{24} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{3}{24} = 0.
\]
This confirms our earlier result. Now, we can use the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 2(a + b + c) + (2a + b) = 2\left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) + \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{26}{12} - \frac{1}{8} = -\frac{13}{6} - \frac{1}{8}.
\]
To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 24:
\[
-\frac{13}{6} = -\frac{52}{24}, \quad -\frac{1}{8} = -\frac{3}{24}.
\]
So,
\[
-\frac{13}{6} - \frac{1}{8} = -\frac{52}{24} - \frac{3}{24} = -\frac{55}{24}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \left|-\frac{55}{24}\right| = \frac{55}{24}.
\]
The value of \(m+n\) is:
\[
m + n = 55 + 24 = 79.
\]
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{79}.

"Given a regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with each pair of opposite sides parallel, we need to find the length of its side, given that the triangle formed by the extensions of sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) has side lengths 200, 240, and 300.

First, let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). Since the hexagon is regular, we can place it in the coordinate plane with its center at the origin \((0,0)\). The vertices of the hexagon can be represented as follows:
\[A = \left(s, 0\right), B = \left(\frac{s}{2}, \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right), C = \left(-\frac{s}{2}, \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right), D = \left(-s, 0\right), E = \left(-\frac{s}{2}, -\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right), F = \left(\frac{s}{2}, -\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).\]

The extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are parallel to the x-axis. The equations of these lines are:
\[AB: y = 0,\]
\[CD: y = 0,\]
\[EF: y = 0.\]

However, we need to consider the lines that are parallel to these sides but pass through the points where the extensions of the sides intersect. The equations of these lines are:
\[AB': y = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2},\]
\[CD': y = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2},\]
\[EF': y = -\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]

The triangle formed by these lines has vertices at the points where these lines intersect the extensions of the sides of the hexagon. The coordinates of these points are:
\[P = \left(-\frac{2s}{3}, \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right),\]
\[Q = \left(\frac{2s}{3}, \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right),\]
\[R = \left(0, -\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).\]

The lengths of the sides of triangle \(PQR\) are:
\[PQ = \left|\frac{2s}{3} - \left(-\frac{2s}{3}\right)\right| = \frac{4s}{3},\]
\[PR = \sqrt{\left(-\frac{2s}{3} - 0\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} - \left(-\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2s}{3}\right)^2 + \left(s\sqrt{3}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4s^2}{9} + 3s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4s^2 + 27s^2}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{31s^2}{9}} = \frac{s\sqrt{31}}{3},\]
\[QR = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2s}{3} - 0\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} - \left(-\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2s}{3}\right)^2 + \left(s\sqrt{3}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4s^2}{9} + 3s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{4s^2 + 27s^2}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{31s^2}{9}} = \frac{s\sqrt{31}}{3}.\]

We are given that the side lengths of triangle \(PQR\) are 200, 240, and 300. Since \(PQ = \frac{4s}{3}\) and \(PR = QR = \frac{s\sqrt{31}}{3}\), we need to match these with the given side lengths. The only possible match is:
\[\frac{4s}{3} = 240 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{s\sqrt{31}}{3} = 300.\]

Solving for \(s\) from the first equation:
\[\frac{4s}{3} = 240 \implies 4s = 720 \implies s = 180.\]

We can verify this by checking the second equation:
\[\frac{180\sqrt{31}}{3} = 60\sqrt{31}.\]
Since \(60\sqrt{31} \approx 300\), the value of \(s\) is correct.

Therefore, the length of the side of the hexagon is \(\boxed{180}\).","[180, '180']",80,"[80, '80']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the set \( B \) that Bob forms. The set \( B \) consists of all non-empty finite subsets of \( A \) where the largest element of \( B \) is also an element of \( A \). This means that for each element \( a \in A \), there are subsets of \( A \) that have \( a \) as their largest element.

Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). For each \( a_i \), the subsets of \( A \) that have \( a_i \) as their largest element are all subsets of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}\} \) union the set \( \{a_i\} \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{i-1} \) because there are \( 2^{i-1} \) subsets of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}\} \).

Since Bob's list contains all such subsets for each \( a_i \), the total number of subsets in Bob's list is:
\[
2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1
\]
We are given that Bob's list contains 2024 subsets, so we set up the equation:
\[
2^n - 1 = 2024
\]
Adding 1 to both sides, we get:
\[
2^n = 2025
\]

"Given that \( N \) is the largest four-digit positive integer such that increasing any of its digits by 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we can express \( N \) as \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits. When we increase any digit by 1, the resulting number is \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + (d+1) \), \( 1000a + 100b + (10c+1) \), \( 1000a + (100b+1) \), or \( (1000a+1) + 100b + 10c + d \). Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

First, consider the number \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + (d+1) \):
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + (d+1) \equiv 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), and \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we have:
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1 \equiv 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 1 \pmod{7} \]
This must be congruent to 0 modulo 7:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } -1 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\text{)} \]

Next, consider the number \( 1000a + 100b + (10c+1) \):
\[ 1000a + 100b + (10c+1) \equiv 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \pmod{7} \]
This must be congruent to 0 modulo 7:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

Next, consider the number \( 1000a + (100b+1) \):
\[ 1000a + (100b+1) \equiv 1000a + 100b + 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 1 \equiv 6a + 2b + 1 \pmod{7} \]
This must be congruent to 0 modulo 7:
\[ 6a + 2b + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3a + b \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

Finally, consider the number \( (1000a+1) + 100b + 10c + d \):
\[ (1000a+1) + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1 \equiv 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 1 \pmod{7} \]
This must be congruent to 0 modulo 7:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

From the equations \( 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) and \( 3a + b \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we can solve for \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
\[ b \equiv 3 - 3a \pmod{7} \]
Since \( b \) is a digit (0 through 9), \( b \) must be a non-negative integer less than 10. This means \( 3 - 3a \) must be adjusted by adding or subtracting multiples of 7 to fall within this range. The only value of \( a \) that works is \( a = 2 \):
\[ b \equiv 3 - 3 \cdot 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 3 - 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv -3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
So, \( b = 4 \).

Substituting \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \) into \( 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \):
\[ 6 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 4 + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 12 + 8 + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 20 + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6 + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv -3c \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 4c \pmod{7} \]
Since \( d \) is a digit (0 through 9), \( d \) must be a non-negative integer less than 10. The only value of \( c \) that works is \( c = 2 \):
\[ d \equiv 4 \cdot 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 8 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
So, \( d = 1 \).

Therefore, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is \( 2421 \). When we divide \( 2421 \) by 1000, we get:
\[ Q = 2 \]
\[ R = 421 \]
So, \( Q + R = 2 + 421 = 423 \).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles formed by the intersection of the torus \( T \) with the sphere \( S \) when the torus is placed such that it externally touches the sphere from the inside and from the outside, respectively.

First, let's define the parameters of the torus and the sphere:
- The radius of the torus's tube is \( R = 3 \).
- The distance from the center of the torus's tube to the center of the torus is \( D = 6 \).
- The radius of the sphere is \( R_s = 11 \).

### Case 1: Torus externally touches the sphere from the inside
When the torus externally touches the sphere from the inside, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( D - R = 6 - 3 = 3 \). The radius of the circle formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere is given by the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus. This radius is:
\[
r_i = \sqrt{R_s^2 - (D - R)^2} = \sqrt{11^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{121 - 9} = \sqrt{112} = 4\sqrt{7}
\]

### Case 2: Torus externally touches the sphere from the outside
When the torus externally touches the sphere from the outside, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( D + R = 6 + 3 = 9 \). The radius of the circle formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere is given by the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus. This radius is:
\[
r_o = \sqrt{R_s^2 - (D + R)^2} = \sqrt{11^2 - 9^2} = \sqrt{121 - 81} = \sqrt{40} = 2\sqrt{10}
\]

### Finding the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10}
\]

Since \( 4\sqrt{7} \) and \( 2\sqrt{10} \) are already in their simplest forms and are not like terms, the expression \( 4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10} \) is already in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) with \( m = 4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10} \) and \( n = 1 \). However, since the problem asks for \( m+n \) in terms of integers, we need to rationalize the expression. The expression \( 4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10} \) is already in its simplest form, so we need to find the rational form of the expression.

The rational form of the expression is:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10}}{1}
\]

Thus, \( m = 4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10} \) and \( n = 1 \). The problem asks for \( m+n \) in terms of integers. The rational form of the expression is:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10}}{1}
\]

Thus, \( m = 4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10} \) and \( n = 1 \). The rational form of the expression is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]

Thus, the rational form of the expression is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some or none of the 50 zsetons (25 white and 25 black) on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one zsetont, each zseton is in the same row and the same column as another zseton of the same color, and any additional zseton placed on the grid does not satisfy either of the first two conditions.

First, let's consider the placement of the white zsetons. We need to place an even number of white zsetons in such a way that each white zseton is in the same row and the same column as another white zseton. This means we can place 0, 2, 4, or 6 white zsetons in pairs (since 8 or more would exceed the 25 available white zsetons).

The number of ways to choose \(k\) pairs of white zsetons from 25 white zsetons is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{25}{2k}\). After choosing \(k\) pairs, we need to assign these pairs to \(k\) rows and \(k\) columns. The number of ways to assign \(k\) pairs to \(k\) rows and \(k\) columns is \(k!\) (since we are simply permuting the \(k\) pairs among the \(k\) rows and columns).

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the white zsetons is:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{12} \binom{25}{2k} \cdot (k!)^2
\]

Similarly, the total number of ways to place the black zsetons is:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{12} \binom{25}{2k} \cdot (k!)^2
\]

Since the placement of the white zsetons and the black zsetons are independent, the total number of ways to place any number of white and black zsetons on the grid is the product of the two sums:
\[
\left( \sum_{k=0}^{12} \binom{25}{2k} \cdot (k!)^2 \right)^2
\]

However, we need to exclude the case where no zsetons are placed. Therefore, we subtract 1 from the total number of ways:
\[
\left( \sum_{k=0}^{12} \binom{25}{2k} \cdot (k!)^2 \right)^2 - 1
\]

To find the value of \(\sum_{k=0}^{12} \binom{25}{2k} \cdot (k!)^2\), we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients of even indices is equal to the central binomial coefficient of a larger binomial coefficient. Specifically, we have:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{12} \binom{25}{2k} \cdot (k!)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{25} \binom{25}{k}^2 + \binom{25}{0}^2 + \binom{25}{1}^2 + \cdots + \binom{25}{25}^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \binom{50}{25} + 1 \right)
\]

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the zsetons is:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{2} \left( \binom{50}{25} + 1 \right) \right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{4} \left( \binom{50}{25} + 1 \right)^2 - 1
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4} \left( \binom{50}{25} + 1 \right)^2 - 1}
