The problem involves determining the value of $s$ based on the given information about the area of a rectangle. The area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. We are given two scenarios with different dimensions and the same area, which we can use to set up equations.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Let's denote the length and width of the rectangle in the first scenario as $s$ and $t-4$, respectively, and the area is given by $s(t-4)$. In the second scenario, the length and width are $s+2$ and $t-2$, respectively, and the area is given by $(s+2)(t-2)$. Since the area is the same in both scenarios, we can set up the equation:
\[ s(t-4) = (s+2)(t-2) \]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[ st - 4s = st - 2s + 2t - 4 \]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ -4s = -2s + 2t - 4 \]
\[ -2s = 2t - 4 \]
\[ -s = t - 2 \]
\[ t = 2 - s \]

Next, we are given that when the length is $s+\frac{1}{2}$, the width is $t$ and the area is the same. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \left(s+\frac{1}{2}\right)t = s(t-4) \]
Substituting $t = 2 - s$ into the equation, we get:
\[ \left(s+\frac{1}{2}\right)(2-s) = s(2-s-4) \]
\[ \left(s+\frac{1}{2}\right)(2-s) = s(-2-s) \]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[ 2s - s^2 + 1 - \frac{s}{2} = -2s - s^2 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 2s - s^2 + 1 - \frac{s}{2} + 2s + s^2 = 0 \]
\[ 4s - \frac{s}{2} + 1 = 0 \]
\[ \frac{8s - s}{2} + 1 = 0 \]
\[ \frac{7s}{2} + 1 = 0 \]
\[ 7s + 2 = 0 \]
\[ 7s = -2 \]
\[ s = -\frac{2}{7} \]

The value of $s$ is $\boxed{-\frac{2}{7}}$.

The problem involves a triangle \(ABC\) with a circumcircle \(\omega\), and a point \(D\) on the arc \(BC\) such that \(\overline{AD}\) intersects \(\omega\) at \(P\). We are given the side lengths of triangle \(ABC\) as \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). We need to find the length of \(AP\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the length of \(AP\), we can use the Power of a Point theorem. First, we need to find the length of \(AD\). We can use the fact that \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) because \(D\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\).

We can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio in which \(AD\) divides the opposite side. However, we need to find the length of \(AD\) or use another approach to find \(AP\).

We can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle, but it's more efficient to use the Power of a Point theorem directly. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \(A\) outside a circle with points of intersection \(P\) and \(D\) with the circle, \(AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC\).

We need to find \(AD\) first. We can use the fact that \(AD\) is the angle bisector and the lengths of the sides of the triangle to find \(AD\), but it's more straightforward to use the formula for the length of the angle bisector or the Stewart's Theorem. However, we can directly use the Power of a Point theorem to find \(AP\).

First, we need to find the length of the angle bisector \(AD\). We can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector:
\[ AD^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right) \]
\[ AD^2 = 5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5 + 10)^2}\right) \]
\[ AD^2 = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right) \]
\[ AD^2 = 50 \left(\frac{144}{225}\right) \]
\[ AD^2 = \frac{144}{9} \]
\[ AD = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we can use the Power of a Point theorem:
\[ AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC \]
\[ AP \cdot 4 = 5 \cdot 10 \]
\[ AP \cdot 4 = 50 \]
\[ AP = \frac{50}{4} = \frac{25}{2} \]

The length of \(AP\) is \(\frac{25}{2}\). The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime. Here, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 2\), so the sum is \(25 + 2 = 27\).

The problem involves finding the probability of a certain event related to the distribution of marks on a circular disc. The event is that a randomly chosen point on the disc falls within a specific region. We need to understand the geometry of the problem and the conditions given.

[ADVANCE]

The problem states that the probability of a randomly chosen point falling within a certain region of the disc is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. We need to find the value of $m+n$.

To solve this, we need to calculate the probability of the point falling within the region. The region is defined by the condition that the point is closer to the center of the disc than to the edge of the disc.

For a point to be closer to the center than to the edge, it must lie within a circle of radius $\frac{1}{2}$ (since the radius of the entire disc is 1). The area of this circle is $\pi \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi}{4}$. The area of the entire disc is $\pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi$.

The probability that a randomly chosen point falls within this region is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the entire disc, which is $\frac{\frac{\pi}{4}}{\pi} = \frac{1}{4}$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{4}$. Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, we can take $m = 1$ and $n = 4$.

Therefore, $m + n = 1 + 4 = 5$.

The problem involves two functions \( f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) and \( g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \). We need to find the area of the region bounded by the curves \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

First, we need to understand the behavior of the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). Both functions are compositions of absolute value functions, which typically result in piecewise linear graphs.

Next, we need to determine the range of the inner functions \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \). Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \) both range from -1 to 1, we need to find the range of \( f(x) \) for \( x \in [-1, 1] \).

[ADVANCE]

Let's calculate the range of \( f(x) \) for \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right|. \]
For \( x \in [-1, 1] \), \( \left| x \right| \) ranges from 0 to 1. So, \( \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \) ranges from -\frac{1}{2} to \frac{1}{2}. Taking the absolute value, \( f(x) \) ranges from 0 to \frac{1}{2}.

Now, we need to find the range of \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). Since \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) both range from 0 to \frac{1}{2}, we need to find the range of \( g(x) \) for \( x \in \left[ 0, \frac{1}{2} \right] \):
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right|. \]
For \( x \in \left[ 0, \frac{1}{2} \right] \), \( \left| x \right| = x \), so \( \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \) ranges from -\frac{1}{4} to \frac{1}{4}. Taking the absolute value, \( g(x) \) ranges from 0 to \frac{1}{4}.

Therefore, \( 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) ranges from 0 to 1, and \( 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) ranges from 0 to 1.

[ADVANCE]

The curves \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) are both bounded by the square with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). We need to find the area of the region bounded by these curves.

Since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are symmetric and periodic, and the sine and cosine functions are also periodic, the curves \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will intersect at points that form a symmetric pattern within the unit square.

By symmetry and the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions, the area of the region bounded by the curves can be calculated by considering the area of the unit square and the symmetry of the functions.

[ADVANCE]

The function \( f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) can be simplified as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
\left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} & \text{if } \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} - \left| x \right| & \text{if } \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{2} 
\end{cases} \]
Similarly, the function \( g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) can be simplified as:
\[ g(x) = \begin{cases} 
\left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} & \text{if } \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{4} \\
\frac{1}{4} - \left| x \right| & \text{if } \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{4} 
\end{cases} \]

By substituting the simplified forms of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) into the equations \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), we can analyze the behavior of the curves within the unit square.

After careful analysis, we can see that the curves \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) form a symmetric pattern within the unit square, and the area of the region bounded by these curves is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Therefore, the area of the region bounded by the curves is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).

The problem involves finding the number of integers $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is an integer such that $n^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$.

[ADVANCE]

Given that $n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}$, we can rewrite this as $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$. This implies that $n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}$, so the order of $n$ modulo $p^2$ must be a divisor of 8. The order cannot be 1, 2, or 4 because $n^1 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}$, $n^2 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}$, and $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$, respectively. Therefore, the order of $n$ modulo $p^2$ must be 8.

[ADVANCE]

Since the order of $n$ modulo $p^2$ is 8, we know that $n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}$ and 8 is the smallest positive integer with this property. This implies that the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p^2$ has an element of order 8, so the group must have order that is a multiple of 8. The order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p^2$ is $\phi(p^2) = p(p-1)$, where $\phi$ is the Euler's totient function. Therefore, $p(p-1)$ must be a multiple of 8.

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the prime numbers $p$ such that $p(p-1)$ is a multiple of 8. We can check the cases for small prime numbers:

- If $p = 2$, then $p(p-1) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$, which is not a multiple of 8.
- If $p = 3$, then $p(p-1) = 3 \cdot 2 = 6$, which is not a multiple of 8.
- If $p = 5$, then $p(p-1) = 5 \cdot 4 = 20$, which is not a multiple of 8.
- If $p = 7$, then $p(p-1) = 7 \cdot 6 = 42$, which is not a multiple of 8.
- If $p = 17$, then $p(p-1) = 17 \cdot 16 = 272$, which is a multiple of 8.

We can see that $p = 17$ is a solution. We need to verify if there are other solutions.

[ADVANCE]

We can use the fact that if $n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$, then the solutions to $m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$ are of the form $m \equiv n, pn, n(pn), n(p^2-n) \pmod{p^2}$. This is because the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p^2$ is cyclic of order $p(p-1)$, and the solutions to $x^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$ are the elements of order 8 in this group.

Since the order of the group is $p(p-1)$, and we know that $p = 17$ is a solution, we can find the number of solutions to $m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2}$. The number of solutions is equal to the number of distinct elements of the form $m \equiv n, pn, n(pn), n(p^2-n) \pmod{p^2}$, which is 4.

Therefore, the number of integers $m$ such that $m^4 + 1$ is divisible by $p^2$ is $\boxed{4}$.

The problem involves a tetrahedron $ABCD$ with given side lengths, and we need to find the length of the line segment $AI$, where $I$ is the intersection of the medians of the tetrahedron. The medians of a tetrahedron intersect at a point that divides each median in a 3:1 ratio.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To find the length of $AI$, we can use the fact that the medians of a tetrahedron intersect at a point that divides each median in a 3:1 ratio. We need to find the length of the median from $A$ to the centroid of the face $BCD$.

First, we will find the length of the median from $A$ to the centroid of the face $BCD$. The centroid of the face $BCD$ is the point where the medians of the triangle $BCD$ intersect. The length of the median from a vertex to the centroid of the opposite side in a triangle can be found using the formula:

\[ AD' = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{2AB^2 + 2AC^2 - BC^2} \]

where $D'$ is the centroid of the triangle $BCD$. However, since we are dealing with a tetrahedron, we can use the formula for the length of the median in a tetrahedron:

\[ AD' = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{4AB^2 + 4AC^2 + 4AD^2 - BC^2 - BD^2 - CD^2} \]

Given the side lengths $AB = \sqrt{41}$, $AC = \sqrt{80}$, $AD = \sqrt{89}$, $BC = \sqrt{89}$, $BD = \sqrt{80}$, and $CD = \sqrt{41}$, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ AD' = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{4(\sqrt{41})^2 + 4(\sqrt{80})^2 + 4(\sqrt{89})^2 - (\sqrt{89})^2 - (\sqrt{80})^2 - (\sqrt{41})^2} \]
\[ AD' = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{4(41) + 4(80) + 4(89) - 89 - 80 - 41} \]
\[ AD' = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{164 + 320 + 356 - 89 - 80 - 41} \]
\[ AD' = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{620} \]
\[ AD' = \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{4 \cdot 155} \]
\[ AD' = \frac{2}{3} \sqrt{155} \]

Since the medians of a tetrahedron intersect at a point that divides each median in a 3:1 ratio, the length of $AI$ is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the length of the median from $A$ to the centroid of the face $BCD$:

\[ AI = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \sqrt{155} \]
\[ AI = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{155} \]
\[ AI = \frac{\sqrt{155}}{2} \]

The length of $AI$ is $\frac{\sqrt{155}}{2}$. The problem asks for the value of $m+n+p$ where the length is in the form $\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}$, and $m$, $n$, and $p$ are integers. Here, $m = 1$, $n = 155$, and $p = 2$. Therefore, $m+n+p = 1+155+2 = 158$.

We need to use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle and then use the formula for the radius of the inscribed circle.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, we calculate the semi-perimeter $s$ of the triangle:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{54 + 23 + 23}{2} = 50. \]

Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area $K$ of the triangle:
\[ K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{50(50-54)(50-23)(50-23)} = \sqrt{50(-4)(27)(27)} = \sqrt{50 \cdot 4 \cdot 27 \cdot 27} = \sqrt{583200} = 540. \]

The radius $r$ of the inscribed circle is given by the formula:
\[ r = \frac{K}{s} = \frac{540}{50} = \frac{54}{5}. \]

We need to find $r^2$:
\[ r^2 = \left(\frac{54}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{2916}{25}. \]

The problem asks for the value of $p+q$ where $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{2916}{25}$, so $p = 2916$ and $q = 25$. Therefore, $p+q = 2916 + 25 = 2941$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can start by simplifying the given logarithmic equations using the property of logarithms $\log_a(b^c) = c \log_a(b)$.

For the first equation:
\[
\log_x\left(y^x\right) = x \log_x(y) = 10 \implies \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation:
\[
\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10 \implies \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}

We also know that $\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}$. Therefore, we can substitute the expressions we found:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5} \implies 10 \cdot 5 = x \cdot 2y \implies 50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25

The game starts with $n$ tokens, and the player who removes the last token wins. We need to find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.

[ADVANCE]

To determine the number of positive integers $n$ for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.

Let's denote a position with $n$ tokens as a losing position if the player whose turn it is will lose if both players play optimally. We can see that:

- If $n = 0$, the player whose turn it is loses (since there are no tokens to remove).
- If $n = 1$, the player whose turn it is wins by removing the single token.
- If $n = 2$, the player whose turn it is wins by removing 1 token, leaving the opponent with 1 token.
- If $n = 3$, the player whose turn it is wins by removing 1 token, leaving the opponent with 2 tokens.
- If $n = 4$, the player whose turn it is wins by removing all 4 tokens.
- If $n = 5$, the player whose turn it is loses because they can remove either 1 or 4 tokens, leaving the opponent with a winning position (4 or 1 tokens, respectively).

We can generalize this pattern. A position $n$ is a losing position if and only if the previous positions $n-1$ and $n-4$ are winning positions. This means that the sequence of winning and losing positions will repeat every 5 tokens, with the losing positions being $n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$.

[ADVANCE]

Since the losing positions are $n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, we need to count the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to 2024 that are not congruent to 0 modulo 5. This is equivalent to counting the number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are not multiples of 5.

The number of multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024 is $\left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is $2024 - 404 = 1620$.

We need to find the probability of this event and express it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions for the sum of the selected numbers to be divisible by 2 and the sum of any two of the selected numbers not to be divisible by 2. This means that the selected numbers must consist of either all odd numbers or all even numbers, but not a mix of odd and even numbers, because the sum of an odd and an even number is odd.

The set \( S \) contains 5 even numbers \(\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\) and 5 odd numbers \(\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}\). We can choose 4 numbers from either the set of even numbers or the set of odd numbers.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 5 even numbers is \(\binom{5}{4} = 5\), and the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 5 odd numbers is also \(\binom{5}{4} = 5\). Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is \(5 + 5 = 10\).

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set \( S \) of 10 numbers is \(\binom{10}{4} = 210\).

The probability of the event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is \(\frac{10}{210} = \frac{1}{21}\).

Since the fraction \(\frac{1}{21}\) is already in its simplest form, we have \(m = 1\) and \(n = 21\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 21 = 22\).

The problem involves two rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ with some shared points and dimensions. We need to find the length of $CE$.

Given:
- $BC = 16$
- $AB = 107$
- $FG = 17$
- $EF = 184$

We are asked to find the length of $CE$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Since $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are rectangles, we can deduce the following:
- $AD = BC = 16$ (opposite sides of rectangle $ABCD$)
- $AB = CD = 107$ (opposite sides of rectangle $ABCD$)
- $EF = GH = 184$ (opposite sides of rectangle $EFGH$)
- $EH = FG = 17$ (opposite sides of rectangle $EFGH$)

We can place the points in a coordinate system to simplify the calculation. Let's place point $D$ at the origin $(0,0)$, then:
- Point $C$ will be at $(16,0)$
- Point $A$ will be at $(0,107)$
- Point $B$ will be at $(16,107)$
- Point $H$ will be at $(17,0)$ (since $EH = 17$ and $E$ is directly above $H$)
- Point $E$ will be at $(17, y_E)$, where $y_E$ is the y-coordinate of point $E$
- Point $F$ will be at $(33, y_E)$ (since $EF = 184$ and $E$ is at $(17, y_E)$)

Since $F$ is also part of rectangle $EFGH$, and $FG = 17$, we can find the coordinates of $F$ and $E$. The y-coordinate of $E$ and $F$ is the same, and it can be found using the height of rectangle $ABCD$.

Next, we need to find the y-coordinate of point $E$. Since $E$ is directly above $H$ and $H$ is at $(17,0)$, the y-coordinate of $E$ is the same as the height of rectangle $ABCD$, which is $107$.

So, point $E$ is at $(17, 107)$. Now, we can find the length of $CE$ using the distance formula:
\[ CE = \sqrt{(x_E - x_C)^2 + (y_E - y_C)^2} = \sqrt{(17 - 16)^2 + (107 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 107^2} = \sqrt{1 + 11449} = \sqrt{11450} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 458} = 5\sqrt{458} \]

However, we need to check if this is the maximum possible value for $CE$ given the constraints.

We have calculated the length of $CE$ as $5\sqrt{458}$. However, we need to verify if this is the correct and maximum possible value for $CE$ given the constraints.

Upon reviewing the problem, we notice that the calculation of $CE$ seems correct based on the coordinates of points $C$ and $E$. The coordinates of $C$ are $(16,0)$ and the coordinates of $E$ are $(17,107)$, which we derived from the given dimensions of the rectangles.

We can conclude that the length of $CE$ is indeed $\sqrt{(17-16)^2 + (107-0)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 11449} = \sqrt{11450} = 5\sqrt{458}$.

Since we have considered the coordinates and dimensions of the rectangles correctly, our approach seems valid and accurate.

The problem involves finding the number of ways to place 8 rooks on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. This is a classic problem of permutations, as each rook must be placed in a unique row and column.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To place the first rook, we have 64 possible squares (8 rows and 8 columns). After placing the first rook, to place the second rook, we have 49 possible squares (7 rows and 7 columns, since one row and one column are already occupied by the first rook). Continuing this pattern, the number of ways to place the rooks is given by the product of the number of available squares at each step:
\[ 64 \times 49 \times 36 \times 25 \times 16 \times 9 \times 4 \times 1. \]
However, this can be simplified by recognizing that we are essentially choosing 8 positions from 64, one in each row and column, which is equivalent to permutations of 8 columns out of 8, i.e., $8!$.

The number of ways to place 8 rooks on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other is the number of permutations of 8 columns, which is $8!$:

The problem involves finding the minimum value of a complex function given a constraint on the variable $z$. The function is $(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}$, and the constraint is $|z|=4$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Given the constraint $|z|=4$, we can express $z$ in polar form as $z=4e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta$ is a real number. The conjugate of $z$ is $\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}$.

Substitute $z=4e^{i\theta}$ into the function:
\[
(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]
\[
= 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + 24(1+3i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
\[
= 4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 24(1+3i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]
\[
= 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta + 3i\cos\theta + 3\sin\theta)
\]
\[
= (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 72\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 72\cos\theta)
\]
\[
= (324\cos\theta - 396\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 540\cos\theta)
\]

To find the minimum value, we can use the fact that the minimum value of a complex number $a+bi$ is the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts. So, we need to find the minimum value of:
\[
\sqrt{(324\cos\theta - 396\sin\theta)^2 + (324\sin\theta + 540\cos\theta)^2}
\]

Next, we simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 396\sin\theta)^2 + (324\sin\theta + 540\cos\theta)^2
\]
\[
= 324^2\cos^2\theta - 2 \cdot 324 \cdot 396 \cos\theta\sin\theta + 396^2\sin^2\theta + 324^2\sin^2\theta + 2 \cdot 324 \cdot 540 \sin\theta\cos\theta + 540^2\cos^2\theta
\]
\[
= 324^2(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) + 540^2(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) + 2 \cdot 324 \cdot (540 - 396) \sin\theta\cos\theta
\]
\[
= 324^2 + 540^2 + 2 \cdot 324 \cdot 144 \sin\theta\cos\theta
\]
\[
= 104976 + 291600 + 93312 \sin(2\theta)
\]
\[
= 396576 + 93312 \sin(2\theta)
\]

The minimum value of $\sin(2\theta)$ is $-1$, so the minimum value of the expression is:
\[
396576 - 93312 = 303264
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of the original function is:
\[
\sqrt{303264} = 550.7
\]

However, we need to check if this value can be simplified to an integer. We can calculate it as:
\[
\sqrt{303264} = \sqrt{144 \cdot 2101} = 12\sqrt{2101}
\]

But we can also express the original function in a different way to find the minimum value. We can use the fact that the minimum value of $|az + \frac{b}{z}|$ is $2\sqrt{|ab|}$ when $|z| = 1$. Here, $|z| = 4$, so we can rewrite the function as:
\[
|(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}| = |75+117i||z| \left|1 + \frac{96+144i}{(75+117i)z^2}\right|
\]
\[
= 4\sqrt{75^2 + 117^2} \left|1 + \frac{96+144i}{(75+117i)z^2}\right|
\]
\[
= 4\sqrt{5625 + 13689} \left|1 + \frac{96+144i}{(75+117i)z^2}\right|

\[
= 4\sqrt{19314} \left|1 + \frac{96+144i}{(75+117i)z^2}\right|
\]
\[
= 4 \cdot 138.97 \left|1 + \frac{96+144i}{(75+117i)z^2}\right|
\]
\[
= 555.88 \left|1 + \frac{96+144i}{(75+117i)z^2}\right|
\]

The minimum value of $\left|1 + \frac{96+144i}{(75+117i)z^2}\right|$ is 1/2, so the minimum value of the original function is:
\[
555.88 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 277.94
\]

However, we can simplify it to an integer value by recalculating the minimum value of the expression. We can use the fact that the minimum value of $|az + \frac{b}{z}|$ is $2\sqrt{|ab|}$ when $|z| = 1$. Here, $|z| = 4$, so we can rewrite the function as:
\[
|(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}| = 2\sqrt{|(75+117i)||96+144i|}
\]
\[
= 2\sqrt{\sqrt{75^2 + 117^2} \cdot \sqrt{96^2 + 144^2}}
\]
\[
= 2\sqrt{\sqrt{5625 + 13689} \cdot \sqrt{9216 + 20736}}
\]
\[

The problem involves finding the radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\), given that the lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) are \(34\) and the length of the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\) is \(2024\). We also know that the radius of the incircle of a triangle can be calculated using the formula \(r = \frac{A}{s}\), where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

Let's denote the length of side \(BC\) as \(a = 34\), the length of side \(AB\) as \(c = 34\), and the length of the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\) as \(h = 2024\). The area \(A\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be calculated using the formula \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times 34 \times 2024 = 34448\).

Since \(AB = AC = 34\), triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles. Let's denote the length of side \(AC\) as \(b = 34\). The semi-perimeter \(s\) of the triangle is given by \(s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{34 + 34 + 34}{2} = 51\).

The radius \(r\) of the incircle can be calculated using the formula \(r = \frac{A}{s} = \frac{34448}{51}\).

Now, we need to simplify the fraction \(\frac{34448}{51}\) to its lowest terms. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 34448 and 51.

After calculating, we find that the GCD of 34448 and 51 is 17. Therefore, we can simplify the fraction as follows:
\[
r = \frac{34448 \div 17}{51 \div 17} = \frac{2024}{3}

So, the radius of the incircle is \(\frac{2024}{3}\).

The problem involves a rhombus $ABCD$ inscribed in the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$. We need to find the value of $BD^2$.

[ADVANCE]

Since $ABCD$ is a rhombus, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ bisect each other at right angles. Let's assume the coordinates of point $A$ are $(x_1, y_1)$, then the coordinates of point $C$ will be $(-x_1, -y_1)$ because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other.

Since $A$ and $C$ lie on the hyperbola, we have:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]
The coordinates of points $B$ and $D$ will be $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(-x_2, -y_2)$ respectively. Since $B$ and $D$ also lie on the hyperbola, we have:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1
\]
The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, so the midpoint of $AC$ and $BD$ is the origin. This means $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$.

[ADVANCE]

The length of the diagonal $BD$ is $2x_2$ (since the coordinates of $B$ are $(x_2, y_2)$ and $D$ are $(-x_2, -y_2)$). We need to find $BD^2$, which is $(2x_2)^2 = 4x_2^2$.

Since point $B$ lies on the hyperbola, we have:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1
\]
We also know that the slope of $AB$ is equal to the slope of $AD$ because $ABCD$ is a rhombus. The slope of $AB$ is $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ and the slope of $AD$ is $\frac{-y_2 - y_1}{-x_2 - x_1} = \frac{y_2 + y_1}{x_2 + x_1}$. Since the slopes are equal, we have:
\[
\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{y_2 + y_1}{x_2 + x_1}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
(y_2 - y_1)(x_2 + x_1) = (y_2 + y_1)(x_2 - x_1)
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
y_2 x_2 + y_2 x_1 - y_1 x_2 - y_1 x_1 = y_2 x_2 - y_2 x_1 + y_1 x_2 - y_1 x_1
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2y_2 x_1 = 2y_1 x_2 \implies y_2 x_1 = y_1 x_2
\]
Since $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$, we can substitute $y_1 = kx_1$ and $y_2 = kx_2$ into the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{(kx_2)^2}{24} = 1
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{k^2 x_2^2}{24} = 1 \implies x_2^2 \left( \frac{1}{20} - \frac{k^2}{24} \right) = 1
\]
We also know that the slope of the diagonal $AC$ is $\frac{y_1}{x_1} = k$ and the slope of the diagonal $BD$ is $\frac{y_2}{x_2} = k$. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1:
\[
k \cdot k = -1 \implies k^2 = -1
\]
Substituting $k^2 = -1$ into the equation, we get:
\[
x_2^2 \left( \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{24} \right) = 1 \implies x_2^2 \left( \frac{12 + 10}{120} \right) = 1 \implies x_2^2 \left( \frac{22}{120} \right) = 1
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
x_2^2 = \frac{120}{22} = \frac{60}{11}
\]
Therefore, $BD^2 = 4x_2^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{60}{11} = \frac{240}{11}$.

The value of $BD^2$ is $\boxed{\frac{240}{11}}$.

The problem involves calculating the number of people who attended the festival in Aimeville. We are given the total number of people who attended the festival from different categories (golf, fashion, and other) and the number of people who did not attend the festival from each category.

Let's denote the total number of people who attended the festival as \( T \). We are given:
- The total number of people who attended from golf, fashion, and other categories is 900.
- The number of people who did not attend from each category is given, and we need to find the number of people who attended.

We can calculate the number of people who attended the festival by subtracting the number of people who did not attend from the total number of people in each category and then summing them up.

However, the problem statement seems to be cut off, and we need to clarify the number of people who did not attend the festival from each category to proceed with the calculation.

Assuming the number of people who did not attend the festival from each category is given as follows:
- Golf: 900 - 367 = 533 attended
- Fashion: 900 - 562 = 338 attended
- Other: 900 - 437 = 463 attended
- Other (saddex): 900 - 234 = 666 attended

We can now calculate the total number of people who attended the festival.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

The total number of people who attended the festival is the sum of the people who attended from each category:
\[ T = 533 + 338 + 463 + 666 \]

Let's calculate the sum.

\[ T = 533 + 338 = 871 \]
\[ T = 871 + 463 = 1334 \]
\[ T = 1334 + 666 = 2000 \]

So, the total number of people who attended the festival is \( \boxed{900} \).

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The problem states that the total number of people who attended the festival from different categories is 900, but it also provides the number of people who did not attend from each category. We should use the correct information to find the total number of attendees.

The correct approach is to use the given information to find the number of people who attended the festival. We can use the fact that the total number of people who attended the festival is the sum of the people who attended from each category.

Since the problem does not provide the correct total number of attendees, we need to use the given information to find the correct answer.

[ADVANCE]

1. Recall that the distance from the incenter \( I \) to a vertex \( A \) of the triangle can be expressed as \( IA = r \csc \frac{A}{2} \), where \( r \) is the inradius and \( \angle A \) is the angle at vertex \( A \).
2. The distance from the circumcenter \( O \) to a vertex \( A \) of the triangle is the circumradius \( R \), which is given as 13.
3. Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OIA \) to relate the distances \( OA \), \( OI \), and \( IA \). Let \( OI = d \). Then, \( OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \), which gives \( 13^2 = d^2 + IA^2 \).
4. We also know that \( OI^2 = R^2 - 2rR \), where \( R \) is the circumradius and \( r \) is the inradius. Substituting the given values, we get \( d^2 = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 13 = 169 - 156 = 13 \).
5. Now, substituting \( d^2 = 13 \) into the equation \( 13^2 = d^2 + IA^2 \), we get \( 169 = 13 + IA^2 \), which simplifies to \( IA^2 = 156 \). Since \( IA = r \csc \frac{A}{2} \), we have \( IA^2 = r^2 \csc^2 \frac{A}{2} \), so \( 156 = 6^2 \csc^2 \frac{A}{2} \), which gives \( \csc^2 \frac{A}{2} = \frac{156}{36} = \frac{13}{3} \).
6. We can use the identity \( \csc^2 \frac{A}{2} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 \frac{A}{2}} \) to find \( \sin^2 \frac{A}{2} = \frac{3}{13} \).
7. The product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be expressed using the formula \( AB \cdot AC = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2} \cos A + 2R^2 \cos A \), but we can also use the fact that \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 4R^2 \sin A \sin C \sin B / \sin A = 4R^2 \sin B \sin C \). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the formula involving the inradius and the semiperimeter.
8. We can use the formula \( AB \cdot AC = (s-b)(s-c) + s^2 - a^2 \), but a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( AB \cdot AC = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2} \cos A + 2R^2 \cos A \) and the relation between the inradius, circumradius, and the angles of the triangle.

However, we can use a known result that for a triangle with circumradius \( R \) and inradius \( r \), if \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), then \( AB \cdot AC = 2R(R-2r) \).

[ADVANCE]

Using the formula \( AB \cdot AC = 2R(R-2r) \), we substitute the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):

\[ AB \cdot AC = 2 \cdot 13 (13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 2 \cdot 13 (13 - 12) = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 1 = 26. \]

We can start by recognizing that the expression \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b\) can be rewritten in a more symmetric form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
ab + bc + ca - \frac{1}{100}abc = 20,000.
\]
We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation along with \(a + b + c = 300\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

To proceed, we can hypothesize that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) might be close to each other, given the symmetry of the problem. Let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then, from \(a + b + c = 300\), we get:
\[
3a = 300 \implies a = 100.
\]
So, \(a = b = c = 100\). We can substitute these values into the equation \(ab + bc + ca - \frac{1}{100}abc = 20,000\) to verify:
\[
100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 - \frac{1}{100} \cdot 100 \cdot 100 \cdot 100 = 30000 - 10000 = 20000.

Since the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) intersects the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) at point \(C\), we can find the coordinates of \(C\) by solving the system of equations formed by the line segments \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{PQ}\).

The line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) can also be represented in the form \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\), respectively. Since \(P = (a, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, b)\), the equation of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\).

The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) can be represented in the form \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). We can substitute this expression for \(y\) into the equation of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) to find the \(x\)-coordinate of point \(C\).

Substitute \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the equation \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\):

\[
\frac{x}{a} + \frac{-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{b} = 1
\]

Multiply through by \(ab\) to clear the denominators:

\[
bx - a\sqrt{3}x + \frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2} = ab
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
(b - a\sqrt{3})x = ab - \frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{ab - \frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2}}{b - a\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2ab - a\sqrt{3}}{2b - 2a\sqrt{3}}
\]

The \(y\)-coordinate of point \(C\) can be found by substituting this value of \(x\) into the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\):

\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{2ab - a\sqrt{3}}{2b - 2a\sqrt{3}}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Simplify the expression for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{-\sqrt{3}(2ab - a\sqrt{3}) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(2b - 2a\sqrt{3})}{2b - 2a\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-2\sqrt{3}ab + 3a + \sqrt{3}b - 3a}{2b - 2a\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-2\sqrt{3}ab + \sqrt{3}b}{2b - 2a\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}b(1 - 2a)}{2b(1 - a\sqrt{3})} = \frac{\sqrt{3}(1 - 2a)}{2(1 - a\sqrt{3})}
\]

The coordinates of point \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{2ab - a\sqrt{3}}{2b - 2a\sqrt{3}}, \frac{\sqrt{3}(1 - 2a)}{2(1 - a\sqrt{3})}\right)\).

The distance \(OC^2\) is given by:

\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{2ab - a\sqrt{3}}{2b - 2a\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}(1 - 2a)}{2(1 - a\sqrt{3})}\right)^2
\]

To find the value of \(OC^2\), we need to determine the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\). Since point \(C\) lies on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), we can use the fact that the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is a family of line segments that intersect \(\overline{AB}\) at a fixed ratio.

By symmetry and the properties of the equilateral triangle formed by the line segments, we can deduce that the point \(C\) is the midpoint of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\) are:

\[
\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2} + 0}{2}, \frac{0 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)
\]

The distance \(OC^2\) is:

\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), and \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).

Next action: [ADVANCE]

We can start by expressing the product in a more manageable form. Notice that the expression $2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}$ can be rewritten using the fact that $\omega^{13} = 1$. We can also utilize the properties of roots of unity.

Consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^{13} - 1$, which has roots $\omega^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12$. We can factorize $P(x)$ as:
\[ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - \omega)(x - \omega^2) \cdots (x - \omega^{12}). \]
We are interested in the product $\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})$. To simplify this, we can consider the polynomial $Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2$, and evaluate the product of $Q(\omega^k)$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12$.

We can use the fact that $\omega^{13} = 1$ to simplify the expression $2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}$. Notice that:
\[ 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2. \]
This is a quadratic expression in terms of $\omega^k$. We can evaluate the product:

where $P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2$. We can evaluate $P(1)$, $P(2)$, $P(i)$, and $P(-i)$:
\[ P(1) = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1, \]
\[ P(2) = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 2 + 2 = 2, \]
\[ P(i) = i^2 - 2i + 2 = -1 - 2i + 2 = 1 - 2i, \]
\[ P(-i) = (-i)^2 - 2(-i) + 2 = -1 + 2i + 2 = 1 + 2i. \]
The product is:
\[ P(1)P(2)P(i)P(-i) = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot (1 - 2i) \cdot (1 + 2i) = 2(1 + 4) = 2 \cdot 5 = 10. \]

\[ x^{13} - 1 = (x - 1)(x - \omega)(x - \omega^2) \cdots (x - \omega^{12}). \]
We can evaluate the product by considering the polynomial $x^{13} - 1$ and the quadratic $x^2 - 2x + 2$.

The problem involves finding the number of integers \( n \) that have exactly two base-\( b \) digits, where \( b \geq 2 \), and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

[ADVANCE]

An integer \( n \) with exactly two base-\( b \) digits can be expressed as \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits, and \( 1 \leq a \leq b-1 \) and \( 0 \leq c \leq b-1 \). The sum of the digits is \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).

Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \), we get \( a + c = \sqrt{ab + c} \). Squaring both sides gives \( (a + c)^2 = ab + c \), which expands to \( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \).

Rearranging terms, we have \( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \). This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \) and \( c \).

[ADVANCE]

We need to find the values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation \( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \) for \( b \geq 2 \), \( 1 \leq a \leq b-1 \), and \( 0 \leq c \leq b-1 \).

Let's analyze the equation further. We can rewrite it as \( a^2 + c^2 + 2ac - ab - c = 0 \). We need to find the integer solutions for \( a \) and \( c \) that satisfy this equation for different values of \( b \).

[ADVANCE]

We can try to find the solutions by iterating over possible values of \( b \) and checking for valid \( a \) and \( c \) that satisfy the equation.

For each \( b \), we can iterate over \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \) and \( c \) from 0 to \( b-1 \), and check if the equation \( a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \) holds.

However, we can also approach this problem by considering the range of \( n \). Since \( n \) has exactly two base-\( b \) digits, the range of \( n \) is from \( b \) to \( b^2 - 1 \). The sum of the digits \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \) implies that \( \sqrt{n} \) must be an integer, so \( n \) must be a perfect square.

Let's find the number of perfect squares in the range from \( b \) to \( b^2 - 1 \) that can be expressed as \( n = ab + c \) with \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).

[ADVANCE]

We can calculate the number of perfect squares in the range from \( b \) to \( b^2 - 1 \). The smallest perfect square in this range is \( b \) and the largest is \( b^2 - 1 \). The perfect squares in this range are \( k^2 \) where \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \leq k \leq b-1 \).

For each perfect square \( k^2 \), we need to check if it can be expressed as \( n = ab + c \) with \( a + c = k \).

Let's calculate the number of valid \( n \) for each \( b \).

After calculating, we find that the number of integers \( n \) that have exactly two base-\( b \) digits, where \( b \geq 2 \), and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \) is \(\boxed{6}\).

The problem involves finding the ratio of the area of a specific region within a dodecagon to the area of the entire dodecagon. The dodecagon is a 12-sided polygon, and we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships within it.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the dodecagon and the area of the specific region within it. Let's start by considering the dodecagon as being composed of 12 congruent equilateral triangles, each with a side length equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle.

The area of one equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$. Since the dodecagon is composed of 12 such triangles, the area of the dodecagon is $12 \times \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 3s^2 \sqrt{3}$.

Next, we need to find the area of the specific region within the dodecagon. The region is a pentagon formed by connecting every third vertex of the dodecagon. We can divide this pentagon into 5 congruent isosceles triangles, each with a base equal to the side length of the dodecagon and a height that can be calculated using the properties of the dodecagon.

The area of the pentagon can be calculated by finding the area of one of these isosceles triangles and multiplying it by 5. The area of one isosceles triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times s \times \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$. Therefore, the area of the pentagon is $5 \times \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{5s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$.

However, we need to consider the specific region within the dodecagon, which is a pentagon with a different configuration. We can see that the specific region is actually composed of 3 of the smaller triangles that form the dodecagon, plus 2 additional triangles that are formed by the intersection of the diagonals.

The area of the specific region is $\frac{3s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} + 2 \times \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{12} = \frac{3s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{9s^2 \sqrt{3}}{12} + \frac{2s^2 \sqrt{3}}{12} = \frac{11s^2 \sqrt{3}}{12}$.

However, we can simplify this by considering the symmetry and the fact that the specific region is actually $\frac{1}{3}$ of the area of the dodecagon.

The ratio of the area of the specific region to the area of the entire dodecagon is $\frac{\frac{1}{3} \times 3s^2 \sqrt{3}}{3s^2 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{3}$.

Therefore, the ratio of the area of the specific region to the area of the entire dodecagon is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

The problem involves finding the average weight of a group of people, given the total weight of the group, the number of people, and some additional information. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given:
- The total weight of the group is 30.
- The number of people in the group is 9.
- The difference between the heaviest and lightest person's weight is equal to the weight of the remaining 7 people.

Let's denote the weight of the heaviest person as $h$ and the weight of the lightest person as $l$. The weight of the remaining 7 people is then $h - l$.

The total weight of the group can be expressed as the sum of the weights of the heaviest person, the lightest person, and the remaining 7 people:
\[ h + l + (h - l) = 30 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2h = 30 \]
So, the weight of the heaviest person is:
\[ h = 15 \]

The weight of the lightest person is $l$, and the weight of the remaining 7 people is $h - l = 15 - l$. The total weight of the group is the sum of these weights, which we already know is 30.

To find the average weight of the group, we need to find the total weight and divide it by the number of people. The total weight is 30, and the number of people is 9, so the average weight is:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{30}{9} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Let's confirm our solution with Python code to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Given values
total_weight = 30
number_of_people = 9

# Calculate the average weight
average_weight = total_weight / number_of_people

We are given that $0 + 0 + a = 999$ and $b + c + 1 = 99$. From the first equation, we can determine that $a = 999$. From the second equation, we can determine that $b + c = 98$.

We need to maximize the sum of the numbers in the first column, which is $0 + b = b$. To maximize $b$, we need to minimize $c$. Since $c$ is a digit, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $0$. If $c = 0$, then $b = 98$.

Therefore, the maximum possible sum of the numbers in the first column is $0 + 98 = 98$.

However, we need to check if the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ satisfy the conditions of the problem. The sum of the first row is $0 + 0 + 999 = 999$, which is correct. The sum of the second row is $98 + 0 + 1 = 99$, which is also correct.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We start with the given system of logarithmic equations:
\[
\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}
\]

Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite each equation as:
\[
\log_2 x - \log_2 yz = \frac{1}{2} \implies \log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2 y - \log_2 xz = \frac{1}{3} \implies \log_2 y - \log_2 x - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2 z - \log_2 xy = \frac{1}{4} \implies \log_2 z - \log_2 x - \log_2 y = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let's denote $\log_2 x = a$, $\log_2 y = b$, and $\log_2 z = c$. Then the system of equations becomes:
\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Next, we can add all three equations to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$:
\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can solve for each variable by subtracting the original equations from this sum:
\[
a + b + c - (a - b - c) = -\frac{13}{12} - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{13}{12} - \frac{6}{12} = -\frac{19}{12}
\]
\[
2b + 2c = -\frac{19}{12}
\]
\[
b + c = -\frac{19}{24}
\]
\[
a = -\frac{13}{12} - (b + c) = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{19}{24} = -\frac{26}{24} + \frac{19}{24} = -\frac{7}{24}
\]

Similarly, we can find $b$ and $c$:
\[
a + b + c - (b - a - c) = -\frac{13}{12} - \frac{1}{3} = -\frac{13}{12} - \frac{4}{12} = -\frac{17}{12}
\]
\[
2a + 2c = -\frac{17}{12}
\]
\[
a + c = -\frac{17}{24}
\]
\[
b = -\frac{13}{12} - (a + c) = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{17}{24} = -\frac{26}{24} + \frac{17}{24} = -\frac{9}{24} = -\frac{3}{8}
\]

And finally, we can find $c$:
\[
a + b + c - (c - a - b) = -\frac{13}{12} - \frac{1}{4} = -\frac{13}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = -\frac{16}{12} = -\frac{4}{3}
\]
\[
2a + 2b = -\frac{4}{3}
\]
\[
a + b = -\frac{2}{3}
\]
\[
c = -\frac{13}{12} - (a + b) = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{8}{12} = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

Now that we have $a = \log_2 x = -\frac{7}{24}$, $b = \log_2 y = -\frac{3}{8} = -\frac{9}{24}$, and $c = \log_2 z = -\frac{5}{12} = -\frac{10}{24}$, we can find $\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)$:
\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{9}{24}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{10}{24}\right)
\]
\[
= -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Finally, we need to find $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$:
\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}

The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction $\frac{25}{8}$, which is $25 + 8 = 33$.

To find the LCM of the six numbers A, B, C, D, E, and F, we can use the fact that the LCM of the six numbers will be the least common multiple of the LCMs of the pairs. We need to calculate the LCM of 200, 240, and 300.

First, we find the prime factorizations of the given numbers:
- $200 = 2^3 \cdot 5^2$
- $240 = 2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$
- $300 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$

Next, we calculate the LCM of these three numbers by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is $2^4$ (from 240)
- The highest power of 3 is $3^1$ (from 240 and 300)
- The highest power of 5 is $5^2$ (from 200 and 300)

So, the LCM of 200, 240, and 300 is $2^4 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^2 = 1200$.

- For \(n = 4\), \(2^4 = 16 \neq 4\), so \(n = 4\) is not a solution.
- For \(n = 5\), \(2^5 = 32 \neq 5\), so \(n = 5\) is not a solution.
- We can see that as \(n\) increases, \(2^n\) grows much faster than \(n\), so there are no solutions for \(n \geq 5\).

However, we need to consider the case where \(n = 0\) again, but this time in the context of the problem. If \(n = 0\), it means set \(A\) is empty. In this case, the only subset of \(B\) that is also a subset of \(A\) is the empty set itself. Since the empty set is a subset of any set, including \(B\), the number of subsets of \(B\) that are also subsets of \(A\) is 1, not 0. Therefore, \(n = 0\) is not a valid solution in the context of the problem.

We need to reconsider the problem and the equation \(2^n = n\). The equation \(2^n = n\) has no valid solution for \(n\) being a positive integer or zero in the context of this problem.

However, we can consider the number of possible sets \(A\) that can be formed. Since set \(B\) has 2024 elements, the number of possible subsets of \(B\) is \(2^{2024}\). But we are looking for the number of sets \(A\) such that the number of subsets of \(B\) that are also subsets of \(A\) is equal to the number of elements in \(A\).

Given the equation \(2^n = n\) has no valid solution, we need to reconsider the problem statement. The problem asks for the number of possible sets \(A\), and we know that the number of subsets of \(B\) that are also subsets of \(A\) is \(2^n\), which is equal to the number of elements in \(A\). However, we found that there is no \(n\) that satisfies this equation.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The number of subsets of \(B\) that are also subsets of \(A\) is \(2^k\) where \(k\) is the number of elements in \(A\). We are given that this number is equal to the number of elements in \(A\), so \(2^k = k\). We already found that there is no positive integer \(k\) that satisfies this equation.

However, we can consider the case where set \(A\) is a subset of set \(B\) and the number of elements in \(A\) is equal to the number of subsets of \(B\) that are also subsets of \(A\). This means we need to find the number of subsets of \(B\) that satisfy this condition.

Given the equation \(2^n = n\) has no valid solution, we can conclude that the number of possible sets \(A\) is 0, because there is no set \(A\) that satisfies the given condition.

Therefore, the number of possible sets \(A\) is \(\boxed{0}\).

The problem involves finding the quotient $Q$ and remainder $R$ when a number $N$ is divided by 7, and then finding the sum $Q+R$ given that $N$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

We are given that $N$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000, which can be expressed as:
\[ N \equiv 1 \pmod{1000} \]
This means $N = 1000k + 1$ for some integer $k$.

We are also given that when $N$ is divided by 7, the remainder is $R$ and the quotient is $Q$, so:
\[ N = 7Q + R \]
where $0 \leq R < 7$.

Since $N = 1000k + 1$, we can substitute this into the second equation:
\[ 1000k + 1 = 7Q + R \]
This can be rearranged to:
\[ 7Q + R = 1000k + 1 \]
We need to find the value of $R$ and $Q$ such that the equation holds true.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

To find the value of $R$, we can reduce $1000k + 1$ modulo 7:
\[ 1000k + 1 \equiv 6k + 1 \pmod{7} \]
Since $6 \equiv -1 \pmod{7}$, we have:
\[ 6k + 1 \equiv -k + 1 \pmod{7} \]
This means the remainder $R$ when $N$ is divided by 7 is $1 - k \pmod{7}$.

Since $0 \leq R < 7$, we need to find the value of $k$ that satisfies this condition. We can try different values of $k$ to find a valid $R$.

Let's try $k = 0$:
\[ R \equiv 1 - 0 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
So, $R = 1$ is a possible value.

Now, we can find the corresponding value of $Q$:
\[ 7Q + 1 = 1000k + 1 \]
\[ 7Q = 1000k \]
\[ Q = \frac{1000k}{7} \]
For $k = 0$, we have:
\[ Q = \frac{1000 \cdot 0}{7} = 0 \]
So, $Q = 0$ and $R = 1$ is a valid solution.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

Now, we can find the sum $Q + R$:
\[ Q + R = 0 + 1 = 1 \]

Since we have found a valid solution, we can conclude that the sum $Q + R$ is 1.

Next action: [OUTPUT]

The problem requires finding the quotient $Q$ and remainder $R$ when a number $N$ is divided by 7, given that $N$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000. We expressed $N$ as $1000k + 1$ and substituted it into the equation $N = 7Q + R$. By reducing $1000k + 1$ modulo 7, we found that $R = 1$ and corresponding $Q = 0$ is a valid solution. Therefore, the sum $Q + R$ is:

The problem involves finding the difference between the internal and external radii of a torus $T$ that is tangent to a sphere $S$ with a radius of 11. The distance between the centers of the torus and the sphere is 6.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

The torus $T$ can be visualized as a doughnut-shaped object with a major radius (distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and a minor radius (radius of the tube itself). The sphere $S$ has a radius of 11 and is tangent to the torus $T$. The distance between the centers of the torus and the sphere is 6.

Let's denote the major radius of the torus as $R$ and the minor radius as $r$. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is $R$, and the radius of the sphere is 11. Since the torus is tangent to the sphere, the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency on the sphere is $R - r$ ( internally tangent) or $R + r$ (externally tangent). Given the distance between the centers is 6, we can set up the following equations:

For the internal radius $r_i$: $R - r_i = 6$ and $R^2 = (r_i + 11)^2 - 6^2$.

For the external radius $r_o$: $R + r_o = 6$ and $R^2 = (r_o + 11)^2 - 6^2$.

We can solve these equations to find $r_i$ and $r_o$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

First, let's solve for the internal radius $r_i$. We have two equations:
1. $R - r_i = 6$
2. $R^2 = (r_i + 11)^2 - 6^2$

From the first equation, we can express $R$ as $R = r_i + 6$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:
$(r_i + 6)^2 = (r_i + 11)^2 - 36$

Expanding and simplifying:
$r_i^2 + 12r_i + 36 = r_i^2 + 22r_i + 121 - 36$
$12r_i + 36 = 22r_i + 85$
$10r_i = -49$
$r_i = -\frac{49}{10}$

Since the radius cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's consider the external radius $r_o$ instead.

For the external radius $r_o$, we have:
1. $R + r_o = 6$
2. $R^2 = (r_o + 11)^2 - 6^2$

From the first equation, we can express $R$ as $R = 6 - r_o$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:
$(6 - r_o)^2 = (r_o + 11)^2 - 36$

Expanding and simplifying:
$36 - 12r_o + r_o^2 = r_o^2 + 22r_o + 121 - 36$
$36 - 12r_o = 22r_o + 85$
$36 - 85 = 34r_o$
$-49 = 34r_o$
$r_o = -\frac{49}{34}$

Again, the radius cannot be negative. We need to reconsider the problem setup. The correct approach involves using the correct geometric relationships.

Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct geometric relationships. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is 6, and the radius of the sphere is 11. The correct equations should be:

For the internal radius $r_i$: $R - r_i = 6$ and $(R - 11)^2 = 6^2 + r_i^2$.

For the external radius $r_o$: $R + r_o = 6$ and $(R - 11)^2 = 6^2 + r_o^2$.

We can solve these equations to find $r_i$ and $r_o$.

Next action: [ADVANCE]

[ADVANCE]

For the internal radius $r_i$, we have:
1. $R - r_i = 6$
2. $(R - 11)^2 = 6^2 + r_i^2$

From the first equation, we can express $R$ as $R = r_i + 6$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:
$(r_i + 6 - 11)^2 = 36 + r_i^2$
$(r_i - 5)^2 = 36 + r_i^2$
$r_i^2 - 10r_i + 25 = 36 + r_i^2$
$-10r_i + 25 = 36$
$-10r_i = 11$
$r_i = -\frac{11}{10}$

Since the radius cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's consider the external radius $r_o$ instead.

For the external radius $r_o$, we have:
1. $R + r_o = 6$
2. $(R - 11)^2 = 6^2 + r_o^2$

From the first equation, we can express $R$ as $R = 6 - r_o$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:
$(6 - r_o - 11)^2 = 36 + r_o^2$
$(-5 - r_o)^2 = 36 + r_o^2$
$25 + 10r_o + r_o^2 = 36 + r_o^2$
$10r_o = 11$
$r_o = \frac{11}{10}$

Now we have the correct values for $r_i$ and $r_o$. The difference between the internal and external radii is:
$r_i - r_o = -\frac{11}{10} - \frac{11}{10} = -\frac{22}{10} = -\frac{11}{5}$

However, we need to find the difference in the absolute sense, so we take the absolute value:
$|r_i - r_o| = \left| -\frac{11}{5} \right| = \frac{11}{5}$

The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, $m = 11$ and $n = 5$, so the sum is:
$m + n = 11 + 5 = 16$

The problem involves determining the probability of drawing a certain type of chip from a $5 \times 5$ grid of chips, where half of the chips are ""good"" and the other half are ""bad"". We need to find the probability that the remaining chip drawn will be ""good"" after one ""good"" chip and one ""bad"" chip have been drawn.

[ADVANCE]

1. **Total number of chips**: The grid is $5 \times 5$, so there are $25$ chips in total.
2. **Number of good and bad chips**: Since half of the chips are good and the other half are bad, there are $12.5$ good chips and $12.5$ bad chips. However, since we can't have a fraction of a chip, we'll assume there are 12 good chips and 13 bad chips or vice versa. For simplicity, let's assume there are 12 good chips and 13 bad chips.
3. **Chips drawn**: One good chip and one bad chip are drawn, so the number of remaining chips is $25 - 2 = 23$. The number of remaining good chips is $12 - 1 = 11$, and the number of remaining bad chips is $13 - 1 = 12$.
4. **Probability of drawing a good chip**: The probability of drawing a good chip from the remaining 23 chips is the number of remaining good chips divided by the total number of remaining chips.

\[ P(\text{good chip}) = \frac{\text{Number of remaining good chips}}{\text{Total number of remaining chips}} = \frac{11}{23} \]

The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{11}{23}}$.
