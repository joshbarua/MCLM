"4시간 24分 = $4\cdot60+24=264$ 分
\begin{align*}
\frac{9}{s}&=t+240\quad\cdots(1)\\
\frac{9}{s+2}&=t+144\quad\cdots(2)
\end{align*}
(1)-(2) gives $\frac{9}{s}-\frac{9}{s+2}=240-144=96$, so $\frac{9}{s}-\frac{9}{s+2}=96$.
This simplifies to $s^2-2s-3=0$, which factors as $(s-3)(s+1)=0$. Since $s>0$, we have $s=3$.
Substituting $s=3$ into (1) gives $t=240-3=237$.
Thus, the time taken when $s+\frac{1}{2}=3+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{7}{2}$ is $\frac{9}{\frac{7}{2}}=\frac{18}{7}$ hours, which is $\frac{18}{7}\cdot60=\boxed{154\frac{2}{7}}$ minutes. ","[1080/7, '154\\frac{2}{7}']",204,"[204, '204']",False

"First, we count the number of ways to color the vertices. There are $2^4=16$ ways to color the vertices. Then, we count the number of ways to rotate the square so that all the blue vertices are in their original positions. There are 4 ways to rotate the square, but only 2 of these rotations will have all the blue vertices in their original positions. Therefore, the probability that all the blue vertices are in their original positions is $\frac{2}{16}=\frac{1}{8}$. The answer is $1+8=\boxed{9}$. ","[9, '9']",371,"[371, '371']",False

"First, we note that if $n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, then the second player can win by removing $4$ tokens on their turn. Therefore, we only need to consider the cases where $n \equiv 1,2,3,4 \pmod{5}$.

If $n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$, then the first player can win by removing $2$ tokens on their first turn, leaving $n-2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ tokens. If $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, then the first player can win by removing $3$ tokens on their first turn, leaving $n-3 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ tokens. If $n \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$, then the first player can win by removing $4$ tokens on their first turn, leaving $n-4 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ tokens.

"First, we find the probability that Jen is not given the opportunity to take the prize.  This is the probability that the four numbers she selects are all among the four numbers that are selected at random.  There are $\binom{10}{4}$ ways to choose four numbers from the ten numbers, and only one of these ways will have the four numbers that are selected at random.  Therefore, the probability that Jen is not given the opportunity to take the prize is $\frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210}$.  Therefore, the probability that she is given the opportunity to take the prize is $1 - \frac{1}{210} = \frac{209}{210}$.  If she is given the opportunity to take the prize, the probability that she is given the prize is $\frac{1}{\binom{4}{2}} = \frac{1}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that she is given the prize is $\frac{209}{210} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{209}{1260}$.  Therefore, $m+n = 209 + 1260 = \boxed{1469}$.

"$\emph{First}$, we count the number of ways to go from the bottom left to the top right without going above the diagonal.  This is the number of ways to choose $8$ of the $16$ moves to be rightward, which is $\binom{16}{8}$.  We can also count the number of ways to go from the bottom left to the top right without going below the diagonal.  This is the number of ways to choose $8$ of the $16$ moves to be upward, which is also $\binom{16}{8}$.  However, we have double-counted the number of ways to go from the bottom left to the top right without going above or below the diagonal.  This is the number of ways to choose $8$ of the $16$ moves to be upward and $8$ of the $16$ moves to be rightward, which is $\binom{16}{8}$.  Therefore, the number of ways to go from the bottom left to the top right without going above or below the diagonal is $\binom{16}{8} - \binom{16}{8} + \binom{16}{8} = \binom{16}{8}$.  The answer is $\boxed{12870}$. ","[12870, '12870']",294,"[294, '294']",False

"First, we find the radius of the incircle of triangle $ABC$. Let $r$ be the radius of the incircle of triangle $ABC$. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of triangle $ABC$. Then, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $rs$. Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the side lengths of triangle $ABC$. Then, the area of triangle $ABC$ is also $\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$. Therefore, $rs = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$. Squaring both sides, we get $r^2s^2 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)$. Dividing both sides by $s$, we get $r^2s = (s-a)(s-b)(s-c)$. By Heron's formula, $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$. Therefore, $r^2 \cdot \frac{a+b+c}{2} = \left(\frac{a+b+c}{2}-a\right)\left(\frac{a+b+c}{2}-b\right)\left(\frac{a+b+c}{2}-c\right)$. Simplifying, we get $r^2 \cdot \frac{a+b+c}{2} = \frac{(b+c-a)(a+c-b)(a+b-c)}{8}$. Multiplying both sides by 8, we get $4r^2(a+b+c) = (b+c-a)(a+c-b)(a+b-c)$. By the triangle inequality, $a+b-c > 0$, $a+c-b > 0$, and $b+c-a > 0$. Therefore, $4r^2(a+b+c) = (b+c-a)(a+c-b)(a+b-c) > 0$. Therefore, $r^2 > 0$. Therefore, $r > 0$.

"First, we can rewrite the given equations as
\begin{align*}
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
\log_2 y - \log_2 x - \log_2 z &= \frac{1}{3}, \\
\log_2 z - \log_2 x - \log_2 y &= \frac{1}{4}.
\end{align*}Adding these equations, we get
\[3 \log_2 x + 3 \log_2 y + 3 \log_2 z = \frac{15}{12} = \frac{5}{4}.\]Thus, $\log_2 (xyz) = \frac{5}{12}.$

Now, we can rewrite the given equations as
\begin{align*}
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
\log_2 y - \log_2 x - \log_2 z &= \frac{1}{3}, \\
\log_2 z - \log_2 x - \log_2 y &= \frac{1}{4}.
\end{align*}Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get
\[2 \log_2 y - 2 \log_2 x = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{6}.\]Thus, $\log_2 \left( \frac{y}{x} \right) = -\frac{1}{12}.$

Subtracting the second equation from the third, we get
\[2 \log_2 z - 2 \log_2 y = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{3} = -\frac{1}{12}.\]Thus, $\log_2 \left( \frac{z}{y} \right) = -\frac{1}{12}.$

Therefore, $\log_2 y = \log_2 x - \frac{1}{12}$ and $\log_2 z = \log_2 y - \frac{1}{12} = \log_2 x - \frac{1}{6}.$

Then, we have
\begin{align*}
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z &= \log_2 x - \left( \log_2 x - \frac{1}{12} \right) - \left( \log_2 x - \frac{1}{6} \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{4} - \log_2 x = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}Thus, $\log_2 x = -\frac{1}{4}.$

Then, we have
\begin{align*}
\log_2 y &= \log_2 x - \frac{1}{12} = -\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{12} = -\frac{1}{3}, \\
\log_2 z &= \log_2 x - \frac{1}{6} = -\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{6} = -\frac{5}{12}.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
\log_2 (x^4 y^3 z^2) &= 4 \log_2 x + 3 \log_2 y + 2 \log_2 z \\
&= 4 \left( -\frac{1}{4} \right) + 3 \left( -\frac{1}{3} \right) + 2 \left( -\frac{5}{12} \right) \\
&= -\frac{15}{12} = -\frac{5}{4}.
\end{align*}Thus, $\left| \log_2 (x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \frac{5}{4},$ and $m+n = \boxed{9}.$ ","[9, '9']",33,"[33, '33']",False

"First, we find the radius of the smaller circle. Let $O$ be the center of the sphere, and let $A$ and $B$ be the points of tangency of the smaller circle with the sphere. Let $C$ be the center of the smaller circle. Then $OACB$ is a rectangle, so $OC=AB=6$. Let $D$ be the center of the sphere, and let $E$ be the point of tangency of the sphere with the larger circle. Then $DE=11$, and $DO=11+6=17$. Let $F$ be the center of the larger circle. Then $DOF$ is a right triangle, so $OF=\sqrt{17^2-11^2}=12$. Let $G$ be the point of tangency of the smaller circle with the larger circle. Then $OG=12-6=6$, so the radius of the smaller circle is $\boxed{6}$. Similarly, the radius of the larger circle is $\boxed{12}$. The difference is $12-6=\boxed{6}$. ","[6, '6']",127,"[127, '127']",False

There are $1$ choice if the first two rows are all white, and $1$ choice if the first two rows are all black. Then, we choose the color of the fourth row.

There are $1$ choice if the first four rows are all white, and $1$ choice if the first four rows are all black. So, there are $2$ ways to color the rows.

Now, we choose the color of the first column. There are $2$ choices. Then, we choose the color of the second column. There are $1$ choice if the first column is all white, and $1$ choice if the first column is all black. Then, we choose the color of the third column. There are $1$ choice if the first two columns are all white, and $1$ choice if the first two columns are all black. Then, we choose the color of the fourth column.

There are $1$ choice if the first four columns are all white, and $1$ choice if the first four columns are all black. So, there are $2$ ways to color the columns.
