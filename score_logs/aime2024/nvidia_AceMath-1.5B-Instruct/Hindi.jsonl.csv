"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the person to walk to the coffee shop and back to the bus stop when the bus speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h. We will use the information given in the problem to set up and solve a system of equations.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( s \) is the speed of the bus in km/h.
- \( t \) is the time spent at the coffee shop in minutes.
- The distance to the coffee shop is 9 km.

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the given information

1. When the speed of the bus is \( s \) km/h:
   - The time taken to walk to the coffee shop is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours.
   - The time taken to walk back to the bus stop is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours.
   - The total time is 4 hours, which includes \( t \) minutes at the coffee shop.
   - Convert 4 hours to minutes: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{9}{s} + \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{18}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
     \]

2. When the speed of the bus is \( s + 2 \) km/h:
   - The time taken to walk to the coffee shop is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours.
   - The time taken to walk back to the bus stop is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours.
   - The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is \( 2 \times 60 + 24 = 144 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 144
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{18}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 144
     \]

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

We have the following system of equations:
1. \(\frac{18}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 240\)
2. \(\frac{18}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 144\)

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
\left( \frac{18}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{18}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 240 - 144
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{18}{s} - \frac{18}{s+2} = 96
\]
Factor out 18:
\[
18 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = 96
\]
Simplify the fraction inside the parentheses:
\[
\frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} = \frac{(s+2) - s}{s(s+2)} = \frac{2}{s(s+2)}
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
18 \cdot \frac{2}{s(s+2)} = 96
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{36}{s(s+2)} = 96
\]
Multiply both sides by \( s(s+2) \):
\[
36 = 96s(s+2)
\]
Divide both sides by 12:
\[
3 = 8s(s+2)
\]
Expand and rearrange:
\[
3 = 8s^2 + 16s
\]
\[
8s^2 + 16s - 3 = 0
\]
Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 8 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -3 \):
\[
s = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{16^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 8}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{256 + 96}}{16}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{352}}{16}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-16 \pm 4\sqrt{22}}{16}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{22}}{4}
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, we take the positive root:
\[
s = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{22}}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Find the time \( t \)

Substitute \( s = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{22}}{4} \) back into one of the original equations to find \( t \). We will use the first equation:
\[
\frac{18}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
\]
\[
\frac{18}{\frac{-4 + \sqrt{22}}{4}} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
\]
\[
\frac{72}{-4 + \sqrt{22}} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
\]
Rationalize the denominator:
\[
\frac{72(-4 - \sqrt{22})}{(-4 + \sqrt{22})(-4 - \sqrt{22})} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
\]
\[
\frac{72(-4 - \sqrt{22})}{16 - 22} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
\]
\[
\frac{72(-4 - \sqrt{22})}{-6} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
\]
\[
-12(-4 - \sqrt{22}) + \frac{t}{60} = 240
\]
\[
48 + 12\sqrt{22} + \frac{t}{60} = 240
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 192 - 12\sqrt{22}
\]
\[
t = 11520 - 720\sqrt{22}
\]

### Step 4: Find the time to walk to the coffee shop and back to the bus stop

When the speed of the bus is \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h:
\[
s + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{22}}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{22} + 2}{4} = \frac{-2 + \sqrt{22}}{4}
\]
The time taken to walk to the coffee shop is:
\[
\frac{9}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{9}{\frac{-2 + \sqrt{22}}{4}} = \frac{36}{-2 + \sqrt{22}} = \frac{36(-2 - \sqrt{22})}{(-2 + \sqrt{22})(-2 - \sqrt{22})} = \frac{36(-2 - \sqrt{22})}{4 - 22} = \frac{36(-2 - \sqrt{22})}{-18} = 2(2 + \sqrt{22}) = 4 + 2\sqrt{22}
\]
The time taken to walk back to the bus stop is the same:
\[
4 + 2\sqrt{22}
\]
The total time is:
\[
(4 + 2\sqrt{22}) + (4 + 2\sqrt{22}) = 8 + 4\sqrt{22}
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the person to walk to the coffee shop and back to the bus stop is \(\boxed{8 + 4\sqrt{22}}\) minutes.","[8 + 4*sqrt(22), '8 + 4\\sqrt{22}']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we start by finding the area of triangle \(ABC\) using Heron's formula. First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):

\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]

Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\):

\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]

The area of a triangle can also be expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C
\]

Using the Law of Cosines to find \(\cos C\):

\[
\cos C = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = \frac{5^2 + 10^2 - 9^2}{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10} = \frac{25 + 100 - 81}{100} = \frac{44}{100} = \frac{11}{25}
\]

Then, \(\sin C\) is:

\[
\sin C = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 C} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{11}{25}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{121}{625}} = \sqrt{\frac{504}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{504}}{25} = \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{25}
\]

Now, we can find the altitude \(h\) from vertex \(A\) to side \(BC\):

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h \implies 6\sqrt{14} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9 \cdot h \implies h = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]

The point \(D\) is the point where the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\) to the incircle meet, and it lies on the line \(AD\). The length \(AP\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent segment from a point to a circle, which is also the length of the segment from the vertex to the point of tangency of the incircle with the opposite side. This length is given by:

\[
AP = \frac{2K}{a} = \frac{2 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]

However, we need to find the correct value of \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). The correct value of \(AP\) is:

\[
AP = \frac{2K}{s} = \frac{2 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}}{12} = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{12} = \sqrt{14}
\]

Thus, \(m = 14\) and \(n = 1\), and \(m + n = 14 + 1 = 15\).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon, with each vertex colored either red or blue, can be rotated such that all blue vertices land on the original positions of the red vertices. This means that the blue vertices must be in the positions originally occupied by the red vertices after a rotation.

First, let's consider the possible colorings of the octagon. There are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings since each of the 8 vertices can be either red or blue.

Next, we need to identify the rotations that will map the octagon back to a configuration where the blue vertices are in the positions originally occupied by the red vertices. The only such rotation is a rotation by 4 vertices, i.e., a rotation by 1/2 of a full turn. This is because a rotation by 4 vertices will map each blue vertex to a red vertex and each red vertex to a blue vertex.

Now, let's count the number of colorings that remain unchanged under this rotation. If we color the vertices in a pattern such that the vertices in positions 1, 5, 2, and 6 are blue, and the vertices in positions 3, 7, 4, and 8 are red, then this coloring will remain unchanged under a rotation by 4 vertices. Any other pattern will not remain unchanged.

There are exactly 2 such patterns:
1. Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red
2. Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue

These are the only two colorings that satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 2 favorable colorings out of the 256 possible colorings.

The probability is given by the ratio of the number of favorable colorings to the total number of colorings:
\[
\frac{2}{256} = \frac{1}{128}
\]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 1\) and \(n = 128\). The sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
1 + 128 = 129
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{129}

"To find the number of points of intersection of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( x \geq 0 \) and \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( x < 0 \).
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) if \( x \geq 0 \) and \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{4} \right| \) if \( x < 0 \).

Now, let's consider the function \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq 0 \) and \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| \sin(2\pi x) + \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( \sin(2\pi x) < 0 \).

Similarly, let's consider the function \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| \cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) if \( \cos(3\pi y) \geq 0 \) and \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| \cos(3\pi y) + \frac{1}{4} \right| \) if \( \cos(3\pi y) < 0 \).

Now, we need to find the points of intersection of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). This is equivalent to finding the points where \( 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), or \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

Since \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) is symmetric about \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) is symmetric about \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), the function \( g(f(x)) \) is symmetric about \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( x = \frac{1}{2} \).

The function \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) is periodic with period 1 and symmetric about \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), and the function \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and symmetric about \( y = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( y = \frac{3}{4} \).

Given the symmetry and periodicity, the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will intersect at 4 points in each period of \( x \) and \( y \). Since the functions are periodic with periods 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\), respectively, the graphs will intersect at 4 points in the interval \([0, 1]\) and 4 points in the interval \([0, \frac{2}{3}]\), and so on.

Therefore, the number of points of intersection is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given condition that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) for some prime \( p \) and positive integer \( n \). We need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is also divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's factorize \( n^4 + 1 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^4 + 2n^2 + 1) - 2n^2 = (n^2 + 1)^2 - (n\sqrt{2})^2 = (n^2 + n\sqrt{2} + 1)(n^2 - n\sqrt{2} + 1).
\]
However, since \( n \) is an integer, we can use the identity for the sum of fourth powers:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
But for integer \( n \), we can use the factorization:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + n\sqrt{2} + 1)(n^2 - n\sqrt{2} + 1) = (n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) + 2n^2.
\]
This factorization is not directly useful for divisibility by \( p^2 \), so we consider the polynomial modulo \( p \).

Let \( p \) be a prime such that \( p^2 \mid n^4 + 1 \). Then \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}.
\]
This means that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8 but not a divisor of 4. Therefore, the order must be 8. This implies that \( p \) must be a prime such that \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) or \( p = 2 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( p \) is the smallest prime for which \( p^2 \mid n^4 + 1 \), we consider the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). The smallest such \( m \) is \( m = n \).

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is:

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCD \) to any of its sides, we start by noting that \( ABCD \) is a kite with \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \). The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, and the incenter \( I \) of a kite lies at the intersection of its diagonals.

First, we calculate the lengths of the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \):
\[ AC = BD = \sqrt{80} = 4\sqrt{5}. \]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the diagonals. Let \( O \) be the intersection of the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \). Since \( O \) is the midpoint of both diagonals, we have:
\[ AO = OC = \frac{AC}{2} = 2\sqrt{5}, \]
\[ BO = OD = \frac{BD}{2} = 2\sqrt{5}. \]

Now, we consider the right triangle \( AOB \) to find the length of \( AB \):
\[ AB^2 = AO^2 + BO^2 = (2\sqrt{5})^2 + (2\sqrt{5})^2 = 20 + 20 = 40. \]
Since \( AB = \sqrt{41} \), this calculation seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct approach.

We use the formula for the area of a kite:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\sqrt{5} \times 4\sqrt{5} = 40. \]

We also use the formula for the area of a kite in terms of its sides and the sine of the included angle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BC \times \sin(\angle ABC) = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{41} \times \sqrt{89} \times \sin(\angle ABC). \]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[ 40 = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{41} \times \sqrt{89} \times \sin(\angle ABC). \]
\[ \sin(\angle ABC) = \frac{80}{\sqrt{41} \times \sqrt{89}} = \frac{80}{\sqrt{3649}}. \]

The inradius \( r \) of a kite is given by:
\[ r = \frac{\text{Area}}{s}, \]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the kite:
\[ s = \frac{AB + BC + CD + DA}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}}{2} = \sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}. \]
Thus,
\[ r = \frac{40}{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}}. \]
Rationalizing the denominator, we get:
\[ r = \frac{40(\sqrt{41} - \sqrt{89})}{(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89})(\sqrt{41} - \sqrt{89})} = \frac{40(\sqrt{41} - \sqrt{89})}{41 - 89} = \frac{40(\sqrt{41} - \sqrt{89})}{-48} = \frac{5(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{6}. \]

Therefore, the distance from the incenter \( I \) to any side of the kite is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{5\sqrt{89} - 5\sqrt{41}}{6}}. \]

The values of \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) are 5, 89, and 6, respectively. Thus, \( m + n + p = 5 + 89 + 6 = 99 \). The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{99}. \]","[99, '99']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can completely contain any of the rectangular boxes in the set \(\mathcal{B}\). The rectangular boxes have a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). We have the following equations:

1. Surface area: \( 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \)
2. Volume: \( abc = 23 \)

We need to find the maximum of the circumradius \( R \) of the rectangular box, which is given by:

\[ R = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}}}{2} \]

First, we express \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) in terms of \( ab + bc + ca \) and \( abc \). Using the identity for the sum of squares, we have:

\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) \]

We already know \( ab + bc + ca = 27 \). To find \( a + b + c \), we use the polynomial whose roots are \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0 \]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0 \]

We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of 23, which are \( \pm 1 \) and \( \pm 23 \). Testing these values, we find:

\[ 1^3 - 1 \cdot 1^2 + 27 \cdot 1 - 23 = 1 - 1 + 27 - 23 = 4 \neq 0 \]
\[ (-1)^3 - (-1)^2 + 27 \cdot (-1) - 23 = -1 - 1 - 27 - 23 = -52 \neq 0 \]
\[ 23^3 - 23 \cdot 23^2 + 27 \cdot 23 - 23 = 23(23^2 - 23^2 + 27 - 1) = 23 \cdot 26 = 598 \neq 0 \]
\[ (-23)^3 - (-23)^2 + 27 \cdot (-23) - 23 = -23(23^2 + 23 + 1) = -23 \cdot 559 = -12857 \neq 0 \]

Since none of these are roots, the polynomial does not have any rational roots. However, we can use numerical methods or the cubic formula to find the roots, but for the purpose of this problem, we can approximate the roots or use the fact that the sum of the squares of the roots can be found using the identity for the sum of squares.

Using the identity and the fact that the roots are positive, we can approximate the sum of the squares. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the maximum radius of the sphere that can contain the box is the circumradius, which is given by:

\[ R = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}}}{2} \]

Given the constraints, we can use the fact that the maximum radius is approximately the cube root of the volume divided by the surface area divided by 2, which is:

\[ R \approx \sqrt{\frac{23}{27}} \]

The exact value of \( R \) is:

\[ R = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{23}{27}}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{23}}{6} \]

Thus, \( r^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{23}}{6} \right)^2 = \frac{23}{36} \). Therefore, \( p = 23 \) and \( q = 36 \), and \( p + q = 23 + 36 = 59 \).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each equation using the properties of logarithms. Recall that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\log_b(b) = 1\). Therefore, \(\log_x(x) = 1\) and \(\log_y(y) = 1\). This implies that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\). Substituting this into the equations, we get:

\[
x \cdot \frac{1}{\log_y(x)} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Let \(k = \log_y(x)\). Then the equations become:

\[
\frac{x}{k} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4yk = 10
\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \(k\):

\[
k = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Substituting this value of \(k\) into the first equation, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{\frac{5}{2y}} = 10
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
\frac{2xy}{5} = 10
\]

To solve for \(xy\), we multiply both sides by 5:

\[

"To determine the number of integers \( n \) such that \( n < 2024 \) and Bob can guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game and the conditions under which Bob can ensure his victory.

First, let's define the game more clearly:
- There are \( n \) tokens on the table.
- Alice starts the game, and in each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens.
- The player who removes the last token wins.

We need to find the values of \( n \) for which Bob can always win, regardless of how Alice plays. This means that for these values of \( n \), Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Winning and Losing Positions:**
   - A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
   - A position is a losing position if any move the player makes leaves the opponent in a winning position.

2. **Determine the Base Cases:**
   - \( n = 0 \): This is a losing position because there are no tokens left to remove.
   - \( n = 1 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove the last token and win.
   - \( n = 2 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who will then lose.
   - \( n = 3 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose.
   - \( n = 4 \): This is a losing position because the player can only remove 1 or 4 tokens, leaving 3 or 0 tokens for the opponent, both of which are winning positions.

3. **Find the Pattern:**
   - From the base cases, we observe that \( n = 4 \) is a losing position.
   - If \( n \) is a multiple of 5, the player can always remove 4 tokens, leaving a multiple of 5 - 4 = 1 token for the opponent, which is a winning position. Therefore, \( n = 5, 10, 15, \ldots \) are winning positions.
   - If \( n \) is not a multiple of 5, the player can always remove 1 token, leaving a multiple of 5 for the opponent, which is a winning position. Therefore, \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, \ldots \) are winning positions.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The losing positions are the multiples of 5.
   - The winning positions are all other integers.

5. **Count the Number of Valid \( n \):**
   - We need to count the integers \( n \) such that \( n < 2024 \) and \( n \) is a multiple of 5.
   - The largest multiple of 5 less than 2024 is 2020.
   - The sequence of multiples of 5 less than 2024 is \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \).
   - This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 5 \), the common difference \( d = 5 \), and the last term \( l = 2020 \).
   - The number of terms \( k \) in this sequence can be found using the formula for the \( k \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence: \( l = a + (k-1)d \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( 2020 = 5 + (k-1) \cdot 5 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( 2020 = 5 + 5(k-1) \), which gives \( 2015 = 5(k-1) \), and further simplifying, we get \( 403 = k-1 \), so \( k = 404 \).

Therefore, the number of integers \( n \) such that \( n < 2024 \) and Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{404}\).","[404, '404']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that the player wins a prize, which means the player either wins a first prize or a second prize. We will do this by finding the probability of each event separately and then summing them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of winning a first prize
A first prize is won if the player has at least two of the four chosen numbers. We will use the complementary probability approach, i.e., find the probability that the player does not win a first prize and subtract it from 1.

The player does not win a first prize if the player has at most one of the four chosen numbers. There are two cases to consider:
1. The player has no of the four chosen numbers.
2. The player has exactly one of the four chosen numbers.

**Case 1: The player has no of the four chosen numbers.**

The player must choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in \( S \) that are not in the chosen set. The number of ways to do this is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]

**Case 2: The player has exactly one of the four chosen numbers.**

The player must choose 1 number from the chosen set of 4 numbers and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in \( S \) that are not in the chosen set. The number of ways to do this is:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

The total number of ways in which the player does not win a first prize is:
\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

The probability that the player does not win a first prize is:
\[
\frac{95}{210} = \frac{19}{42}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the player wins a first prize is:
\[
1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of winning a second prize
A second prize is won if the player has all four chosen numbers. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the chosen set of 4 numbers is:
\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

The probability that the player wins a second prize is:
\[
\frac{1}{210}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total probability of winning a prize
The total probability of winning a prize is the sum of the probabilities of winning a first prize and winning a second prize:
\[
\frac{23}{42} + \frac{1}{210} = \frac{115}{210} + \frac{1}{210} = \frac{116}{210} = \frac{58}{105}
\]

Thus, the probability that the player wins a prize is \(\frac{58}{105}\). The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 58 and 105, respectively. Therefore, \(m + n = 58 + 105 = 163\).

"Given the problem, we need to find the length of \(CE\) in the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) with the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
   - \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic ( lie on the same circle).
   - \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

2. **Use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals:**
   Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). However, we don't need this property directly to find \(CE\).

3. **Use the property of collinear points:**
   Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) lies on the line segment \(DF\) extended. We need to find the length of \(CE\).

4. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   The Power of a Point Theorem states that for two chords \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at a point \(E\) inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one chord are equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. However, since \(E\) is on the line \(DF\) and not inside a circle, we need to use the fact that \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals of the cyclic quadrilateral \(ADGH\) and \(CDGF\).

5. **Use the fact that \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals:**
   Since \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(DF\) of the cyclic quadrilateral \(ADGH\) and \(CDGF\), we can use the fact that the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral intersect such that the products of the lengths of the segments of one diagonal are equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of the other diagonal.

6. **Calculate \(CE\):**
   Since \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(DF\), we can use the fact that \(CE\) is the geometric mean of the segments \(CD\) and \(EF\). However, we need to find the length of \(CD\) first.

7. **Use the Pythagorean theorem:**
   Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle (because \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic and \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(CD\).

8. **Calculate \(CD\):**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ABC\):
   \[
   AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
   \]
   \[
   107^2 + 16^2 = AC^2
   \]
   \[
   11449 + 256 = AC^2
   \]
   \[
   11705 = AC^2
   \]
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{11705}
   \]

9. **Calculate \(CE\):**
   Since \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(DF\), we can use the fact that \(CE\) is the geometric mean of the segments \(CD\) and \(EF\):
   \[
   CE = \sqrt{CD \cdot EF}
   \]
   However, we need to find the length of \(CD\) first.

10. **Use the fact that \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals:**
    Since \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(DF\), we can use the fact that \(CE\) is the geometric mean of the segments \(CD\) and \(EF\):
    \[
    CE = \sqrt{CD \cdot EF}
    \]
    However, we need to find the length of \(CD\) first.

11. **Calculate \(CE\):**
    Since \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(DF\), we can use the fact that \(CE\) is the geometric mean of the segments \(CD\) and \(EF\):
    \[
    CE = \sqrt{CD \cdot EF}
    \]

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, with exactly four direction changes. Each path consists of 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), and a direction change occurs whenever the direction of the path changes from R to U or from U to R.

We can represent a path as a sequence of 16 moves, where each move is either R or U. A path with exactly four direction changes can be thought of as a sequence of four segments, where each segment is a sequence of consecutive R's or U's, and the total number of R's and U's in the entire sequence is 8 each.

Let's denote the number of R's in the first segment as \(a_1\), the number of U's in the first segment as \(b_1\), the number of R's in the second segment as \(a_2\), the number of U's in the second segment as \(b_2\), and so on. We have the following conditions:
1. \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 8\) (since there are 8 R's and 8 U's in total)
2. \(a_1 + b_1 = a_2 + b_2 = a_3 + b_3 = a_4 + b_4 = 4\) (since each segment must have exactly 4 moves)

We need to count the number of ways to assign values to \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\) that satisfy these conditions. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of 8 for the R's in the first segment, then 4 positions out of the remaining 4 for the R's in the second segment, and so on.

The number of ways to do this is given by the product of the binomial coefficients:
\[
\binom{8}{4} \times \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{4}{4} = \binom{8}{4} = 70

Therefore, the number of paths that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, with exactly four direction changes, is \(\boxed{70}\).","[70, '70']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the largest real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta)
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this simplifies to:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(468\cos\theta + 300\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
\]

Combining the real and imaginary parts, we have:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(468\cos\theta + 336\sin\theta)
\]

The real part of this expression is:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To maximize this real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). The maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so the maximum value is:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) given that there are 2024 circles of radius 34 that are tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle, and 2024 circles of radius 1 that are tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle.

First, let's consider the general formula for the inradius \(r\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[ r = \frac{A}{s} \]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

For a circle of radius \(R\) that is tangent to the sides of the triangle and to other circles of radius \(R\), the distance from the center of the circle to the incenter of the triangle is \(R + r\). The number of such circles that can be tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle is given by the formula:
\[ \frac{2\pi}{\theta} \]
where \(\theta\) is the angle at the incenter subtended by the arc between the centers of two adjacent circles. For a circle of radius \(R\), this angle is:
\[ \theta = \frac{2\pi}{n} \]
where \(n\) is the number of circles. Therefore, the number of circles is:
\[ n = \frac{2\pi}{\theta} = \frac{2\pi}{\frac{2\pi}{n}} = n \]

Given that there are 2024 circles of radius 34, we have:
\[ n = 2024 \]

The distance from the incenter to the center of one of these circles is:
\[ R + r = 34 \]

For a circle of radius 1, the distance from the incenter to the center of one of these circles is:
\[ R + r = 1 \]

The ratio of the distances is:
\[ \frac{34}{1} = 34 \]

This means that the semi-perimeter \(s\) of the triangle is 34 times the inradius \(r\):
\[ s = 34r \]

The area \(A\) of the triangle can be expressed as:
\[ A = r \cdot s = r \cdot 34r = 34r^2 \]

The inradius \(r\) is:
\[ r = \frac{A}{s} = \frac{34r^2}{34r} = r \]

"To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a square \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we start by considering the properties of the hyperbola and the square.

The hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) has its center at the origin \((0,0)\) and its asymptotes are given by the equations \(y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{24}{20}} x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\).

For a square inscribed in a hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the vertices of the square can be represented as \((x, y)\), \((-x, y)\), \((-x, -y)\), and \((x, -y)\). Since these points lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) of the square is given by the distance between the points \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\), which is:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2} = 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\).

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x^2 + y^2\) subject to the constraint \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). We can express \(y^2\) in terms of \(x^2\) using the hyperbola equation:

\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{y^2}{24} = \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \implies y^2 = 24\left(\frac{x^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24.
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \(x^2 + y^2\), we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24 = \frac{11x^2}{5} - 24.
\]
To maximize \(x^2 + y^2\), we need to maximize \(\frac{11x^2}{5} - 24\). Since \(x^2\) can be arbitrarily large, the maximum value of \(x^2 + y^2\) is unbounded. However, we are asked for the maximum value of \(BD^2\) in the context of the problem, which implies we need to consider the geometric constraints and the fact that the square is inscribed in the hyperbola.

The maximum value of \(BD^2\) occurs when the square is as large as possible, which happens when the vertices of the square are at the points where the asymptotes intersect the hyperbola. At these points, the hyperbola approaches its asymptotes, and the values of \(x\) and \(y\) are such that the square is maximized.

By symmetry and the properties of the hyperbola, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:
- Let \( A \) be the set of students with a baseball cap.
- Let \( B \) be the set of students with a golf club.
- Let \( C \) be the set of students with a basketball.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of students is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of students with a baseball cap is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of students with a golf club is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of students with a basketball is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of students with a basketball hat is \( |A^c \cap B^c \cap C^c| = 437 \).
- The number of students with exactly two items is 234.

First, we find the number of students who have at least one of the items:
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |U| - |A^c \cap B^c \cap C^c| = 900 - 437 = 463. \]

Next, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to express \( |A \cup B \cup C| \):
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|. \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ 463 = 195 + 367 + 562 - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|. \]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
\[ 463 = 1124 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|) + |A \cap B \cap C|. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - |A \cap B \cap C| = 1124 - 463 = 661. \]

We also know that the number of students with exactly two items is 234. This can be expressed as:
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - 3|A \cap B \cap C| = 234. \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - |A \cap B \cap C| = 661 \)
2. \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - 3|A \cap B \cap C| = 234 \)

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
\[ (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - |A \cap B \cap C|) - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - 3|A \cap B \cap C|) = 661 - 234. \]
Simplifying, we have:
\[ 2|A \cap B \cap C| = 427. \]
Thus,
\[ |A \cap B \cap C| = \frac{427}{2} = 213.5. \]

Now, substituting \( |A \cap B \cap C| = 213.5 \) back into the first equation, we get:
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| - 213.5 = 661. \]
Simplifying, we have:
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| = 874.5. \]

Finally, we substitute \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| = 874.5 \) and \( |A \cap B \cap C| = 213.5 \) into the expression for the number of students with exactly three items:
\[ |A \cap B \cap C| = 213.5. \]

Therefore, the number of students who have exactly three items is \(\boxed{213}\).","[213, '213']",73,"[73, '73']",False
"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) has a circumcenter \( O \) and an incenter \( I \) such that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the perimeter of the triangle is 13, and the inradius is 6, we need to find the value of \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall that the distance between the incenter \( I \) and the circumcenter \( O \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
where \( R \) is the circumradius and \( r \) is the inradius. Here, \( r = 6 \). We also know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), which implies that \( I \) lies on the angle bisector of \( \angle BAC \) and \( \overline{IA} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{OI} \). This configuration suggests that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).

For a right triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is half the hypotenuse \( BC \). The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides, which is given by:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 13
\]
Since \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \), we have \( BC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} \). The inradius \( r \) of a right triangle is given by:
\[
r = \frac{a + b - c}{2}
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the legs and \( c \) is the hypotenuse. Here, \( r = 6 \), so:
\[
6 = \frac{AB + AC - BC}{2} \implies 12 = AB + AC - BC \implies BC = AB + AC - 12
\]
Substituting \( BC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} \) into the equation, we get:
\[
\sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} = AB + AC - 12
\]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[
AB^2 + AC^2 = (AB + AC - 12)^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 + 2AB \cdot AC + 144 - 24(AB + AC)
\]
Subtracting \( AB^2 + AC^2 \) from both sides, we get:
\[
0 = 2AB \cdot AC + 144 - 24(AB + AC)
\]
Since \( AB + AC = 13 - BC \) and \( BC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} \), we substitute \( AB + AC = 13 - \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} \) into the equation:
\[
0 = 2AB \cdot AC + 144 - 24(13 - \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2})
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
0 = 2AB \cdot AC + 144 - 312 + 24\sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} \implies 0 = 2AB \cdot AC - 168 + 24\sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2}
\]
Since \( \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} = 12 \), we substitute \( \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} = 12 \) into the equation:
\[
0 = 2AB \cdot AC - 168 + 24 \cdot 12 \implies 0 = 2AB \cdot AC - 168 + 288 \implies 0 = 2AB \cdot AC + 120 \implies 2AB \cdot AC = 120 \implies AB \cdot AC = 60

Thus, the value of \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To find the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the given equation. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), the equation becomes:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We can divide the entire equation by 3:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.
\]

To find possible solutions, we can test some values. Let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equation, we get:

\[
100(100)(100) - 100(100)(100) = 1,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0,
\]

which does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, \(a, b, c\) cannot all be equal.

Next, let's try another approach. Suppose \(a = 200\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 0\). Then \(a + b + c = 200 + 100 + 0 = 300\). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[
200(100)(0) + 200(0)(0) + 100(200)(0) + 100(0)(0) + 0(200)(100) + 0(100)(0) = 0,
\]

which does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, \(a, b, c\) cannot all be 200, 100, and 0 in any permutation.

Now, let's try \(a = 200\), \(b = 0\), and \(c = 100\). Then \(a + b + c = 200 + 0 + 100 = 300\). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[
200(0)(100) + 200(100)(100) + 0(200)(100) + 0(200)(100) + 100(200)(0) + 100(0)(100) = 20,000,000,
\]

which does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, \(a, b, c\) cannot be 200, 0, and 100 in any permutation.

Finally, let's try \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\). Then \(a + b + c = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300\). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[
100(100)(100) + 100(100)(100) + 100(100)(100) = 3,000,000,
\]

which does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, \(a, b, c\) cannot all be equal.

After testing several values, we find that the only solution is \(a = 200\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 0\) in any permutation. There are 3 permutations of \((200, 100, 0)\), which are \((200, 100, 0)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), and \((100, 200, 0)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\), \((0, 100, 200)\).

Thus, the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that the distance from \(O\) to \(C\) is maximized while ensuring that \(C\) is not on any of the segments of \(\mathcal{F}\). The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) has endpoints \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The equation of the line passing through \(A\) and \(B\) can be found as follows:

The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

The point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) can be parameterized as \(C = (x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). The distance from \(O\) to \(C\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}}
\]
To maximize \(OC\), we need to maximize the quadratic expression inside the square root, \(4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}\). The maximum value of a quadratic function \(ax^2 + bx + c\) occurs at \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\). Here, \(a = 4\) and \(b = -3\), so:
\[
x = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into the equation of the line, we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{12}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{16}\). Here, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), so \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

"Given that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity and \(\omega \neq 1\), we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the 13th roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000.

First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]
We can factor this expression by considering it as a quadratic in terms of \(\omega^k\):
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = \frac{1}{2} \left(4 - 4\omega^k + 2\omega^{2k}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(2\omega^k - 2\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left(2(\omega^k - 1)\right)^2 = 2(\omega^k - 1)^2.\]
Thus, the product becomes:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} 2(\omega^k - 1)^2 = 2^{13} \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1)^2.\]
We know that the product of all 13th roots of unity except 1 is \((-1)^{12} = 1\), so:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} \omega^k = 1.\]
Therefore, the product of all 13th roots of unity is:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} \omega^k = \omega^0 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12} \omega^k = 1 \cdot 1 = 1.\]
This implies:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1) = 1.\]
Thus, we have:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1)^2 = \left(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1)\right)^2 = 1^2 = 1.\]
So the original product is:
\[2^{13} \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - 1)^2 = 2^{13} \cdot 1 = 8192.\]
Now, we need to find the remainder when 8192 is divided by 1000. We do this by performing the division:
\[8192 \div 1000 = 8 \text{ remainder } 192.\]
Therefore, the remainder is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than 10 \( b \)-elegant positive integers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant if its base \( b \) representation has exactly two digits, and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant, then it can be written as \( ab + c \) where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits in base \( b \) and \( 0 \leq c < b \). The sum of the digits is \( a + c \), and we need \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it satisfies \( b^2 \leq n < b^2 + b \). Therefore, \( b \leq \sqrt{n} < b + 1 \), which implies \( b \leq a + c < b + 1 \). Since \( a + c \) is an integer, we have \( a + c = b \).

Thus, \( n = ab + c = ab + (b - a) = b^2 \). The number \( n = b^2 \) is \( b \)-elegant because its base \( b \) representation is \( b0 \), and the sum of the digits is \( b + 0 = b \), which equals \( \sqrt{b^2} \).

Now, we need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than 10 \( b \)-elegant numbers. Since each \( b \)-elegant number is \( b^2 \), we need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than 10 perfect squares that are two-digit numbers in base \( b \).

The largest two-digit number in base \( b \) is \( b^2 - 1 \). Therefore, we need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than 10 perfect squares less than \( b^2 \). The perfect squares less than \( b^2 \) are \( 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots, (b-1)^2 \). We need \( b-1 > 10 \), which implies \( b > 11 \).

The smallest integer greater than 11 is 12. Therefore, the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than 10 \( b \)-elegant numbers is \( \boxed{12} \).","[12, '12']",211,"[211, '211']",False
"To determine how many rectangles can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) such that each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the conditions for forming a rectangle.

A rectangle in a regular dodecagon must have its sides as either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and the opposite sides of the rectangle must be equal and parallel. This means that the vertices of the rectangle must be vertices of the dodecagon such that the sides connecting them are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Let's denote the vertices of the dodecagon as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12}\) in order. A rectangle can be formed by choosing four vertices \(A_i, A_j, A_k, A_l\) such that the sides \(A_iA_j, A_jA_k, A_kA_l, A_lA_i\) are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and the opposite sides are equal and parallel.

This is equivalent to choosing two pairs of opposite vertices of the dodecagon. For example, if we choose vertices \(A_1\) and \(A_7\), then the opposite vertices must be \(A_2\) and \(A_8\), \(A_3\) and \(A_9\), and so on. This is because the dodecagon is regular, and the only way to form a rectangle is to choose vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center of the dodecagon.

There are 6 pairs of opposite vertices in a dodecagon:
\[
(A_1, A_7), (A_2, A_8), (A_3, A_9), (A_4, A_{10}), (A_5, A_{11}), (A_6, A_{12})

Thus, the number of rectangles that can be formed is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"Given the conditions for the set of positive integers, let's denote the set by \( S = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). The conditions are:

2. The minimum element of the set is 9, i.e., \( a_1 = 9 \).
3. The median of the set is a positive integer that is not in the set.

Since the median is the middle element of the set when \( n \) is odd, and it is not in the set, \( n \) must be even. Let \( n = 2k \). Then the median is the average of the \( k \)-th and \( (k+1) \)-th elements, i.e., \( \frac{a_k + a_{k+1}}{2} \), and it must be an integer, so \( a_k + a_{k+1} \) must be even. Therefore, \( a_k \) and \( a_{k+1} \) must both be either odd or even.

"To solve the problem, we need to find all possible ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the digits in each row is 999 and the sum of the digits in each column is 99. Let's denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we have the following conditions:
1. \(a + b + c = 999\)
2. \(d + e + f = 999\)
3. \(a + d = 99\)
4. \(b + e = 99\)
5. \(c + f = 99\)

First, let's express \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 99 - a, \quad e = 99 - b, \quad f = 99 - c
\]

Substituting these into the first two conditions, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 999
\]
\[
(99 - a) + (99 - b) + (99 - c) = 999
\]

Simplifying the second equation:
\[
297 - (a + b + c) = 999
\]
\[
297 - 999 = a + b + c
\]
\[
-702 = a + b + c

This is a contradiction because \(a + b + c = 999\) from the first condition. Therefore, there are no possible ways to fill the grid such that the sum of the digits in each row is 999 and the sum of the digits in each column is 99.

"Given the equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2},
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4},
\]
we can rewrite them in exponential form:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2},
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3},
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}.
\]
Next, we multiply all three equations together:
\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}.
\]
The left side simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1.
\]
So, we have:
\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}.
\]
Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:
\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}.
\]
To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}.
\]
So,
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
1 = 2^{13/12}.
\]
Taking the base-2 logarithm of both sides, we get:
\[
\log_2(1) = \log_2(2^{13/12}).
\]
Since \(\log_2(1) = 0\) and \(\log_2(2^{13/12}) = \frac{13}{12}\), we have:
\[
0 = \frac{13}{12},
\]
which is a contradiction. This indicates that there was a misinterpretation in the problem setup or a need to re-evaluate the constraints. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and the equations are consistent in some other context, we can proceed with the next part.

We need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the properties of logarithms, we have:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z).
\]
From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of each other. From \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\), we get:
\[
\log_2(x) = \log_2(yz) + \log_2(\sqrt{2}) = \log_2(y) + \log_2(z) + \frac{1}{2}.
\]
From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\), we get:
\[
\log_2(y) = \log_2(xz) + \log_2(2^{1/3}) = \log_2(x) + \log_2(z) + \frac{1}{3}.
\]
From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\), we get:
\[
\log_2(z) = \log_2(xy) + \log_2(2^{1/4}) = \log_2(x) + \log_2(y) + \frac{1}{4}.
\]
We can solve these equations simultaneously, but a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the logarithms must be consistent with the product of the original equations. By symmetry and the nature of the problem, we can assume:
\[
\log_2(x) = \frac{13}{12}, \quad \log_2(y) = \frac{13}{12}, \quad \log_2(z) = \frac{13}{12}.
\]
Then,
\[
4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) = 4 \cdot \frac{13}{12} + 3 \cdot \frac{13}{12} + 2 \cdot \frac{13}{12} = \frac{52}{12} + \frac{39}{12} + \frac{26}{12} = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\), and \(m = 39\) and \(n = 4\). The sum \(m + n\) is:

"Given that \(ABCDEF\) is a regular hexagon with all opposite sides parallel, we can consider the hexagon as composed of two equilateral triangles and a rectangle. The sides of the hexagon are \(AB = a\), \(BC = b\), \(CD = c\), \(DE = d\), \(EF = e\), and \(FA = f\). Since the hexagon is regular, all sides are equal, so \(a = b = c = d = e = f\).

The triangle formed by the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the length of one side of the hexagon, which is the same as the length of any side of the equilateral triangles that make up the hexagon.

Let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). The triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300 is a right triangle because \(200^2 + 240^2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600 = 300^2\).

In a regular hexagon, the distance between two opposite sides is equal to the height of two equilateral triangles with side length \(s\). The height \(h\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by:
\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]
Therefore, the distance between two opposite sides of the hexagon is:
\[ 2h = \sqrt{3} s \]

This distance is also the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. So, we have:
\[ \sqrt{3} s = 300 \]
Solving for \(s\), we get:
\[ s = \frac{300}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{300 \sqrt{3}}{3} = 100 \sqrt{3} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) and the set \( B \) that Bob constructs. Bob constructs all finite, non-empty subsets \( B \) of the real numbers such that the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The number of such subsets \( B \) is given as 2024.

First, let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), we can form subsets \( B \) where the maximum element is \( a_i \). These subsets are all the subsets of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}\} \) together with \( a_i \). The number of subsets of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}\} \) is \( 2^{i-1} \). Therefore, the number of subsets \( B \) where the maximum element is \( a_i \) is \( 2^{i-1} \).

Since the total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of the subsets for each element in \( A \), we have:
\[
2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-1} = 2024
\]
This is a geometric series with the sum:
\[
2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1
\]
Setting this equal to 2024, we get:
\[
2^n - 1 = 2024 \implies 2^n = 2025
\]
Since \( 2^{11} = 2048 \) and \( 2^{10} = 1024 \), we see that \( n = 11 \). Therefore, the elements of \( A \) are \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11} \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_{11} \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_{11}

However, the problem does not provide the specific values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11} \), but we can still find the sum of the elements of \( A \) by considering the sum of the subsets \( B \) for each element in \( A \). The sum of the elements of \( A \) is the sum of the maximum elements of all subsets \( B \) divided by the number of subsets \( B \) that have each element as the maximum.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that when any of its digits is replaced by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits.

First, we need to check the divisibility of the numbers formed by replacing each digit with 1:
- \( 1bcd \)
- \( a1cd \)
- \( ab1d \)
- \( abc1 \)

We can express these numbers as:
- \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)
- \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \)
- \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + 10d \)
- \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)

For \( N \) to satisfy the condition, each of these numbers must be divisible by 7. Let's start by checking the divisibility of \( N \) itself. We can write \( N \) as:
\[ N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \]

We need to find the largest \( N \) such that:
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

First, we find the remainders of the powers of 10 modulo 7:
\[ 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 100 \equiv 3^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000 \equiv 3^3 \equiv 27 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

Using these remainders, we can rewrite \( N \) modulo 7:
\[ N \equiv 6a + 2b + 3c + d \pmod{7} \]

We need to find the largest \( N \) such that:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

To maximize \( N \), we should start with the largest possible digit for \( a \), which is 9. Let's try \( a = 9 \):
\[ 6 \cdot 9 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]

Next, we try the largest possible digit for \( b \), which is 9:
\[ 2 \cdot 9 + 3c + d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 18 + 3c + d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 18 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 4 + 3c + d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c + d \equiv -2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

Next, we try the largest possible digit for \( c \), which is 9:
\[ 3 \cdot 9 + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 27 + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 27 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6 + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

\[ 9996 \div 1000 = 9 \text{ remainder } 996 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the two circles that are tangent to the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \), and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's analyze the geometry of the torus \( T \). The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube is 6 units, and the radius of the tube is 3 units.

The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11 units. We need to find the radii of the two circles that are tangent to both the torus and the sphere. These circles are the inner and outer circles of the torus when viewed from the side.

The inner circle is the circle that is closest to the axis of rotation of the torus, and the outer circle is the circle that is farthest from the axis of rotation. The radius of the inner circle is the distance from the axis of rotation to the inner surface of the torus, which is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units. The radius of the outer circle is the distance from the axis of rotation to the outer surface of the torus, which is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units.

However, we need to consider the tangency with the sphere \( S \). The inner circle must be tangent to the sphere, and the outer circle must also be tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 units, and the radius of the sphere is 11 units. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner surface of the torus is \( 11 - 3 = 8 \) units, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus is \( 11 + 9 = 20 \) units.

The radius of the inner circle \( r_i \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner surface of the torus minus the radius of the sphere, which is \( 8 - 11 = -3 \) units. However, since the inner circle is inside the sphere, the radius is actually 3 units. The radius of the outer circle \( r_o \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus minus the radius of the sphere, which is \( 20 - 11 = 9 \) units.

The difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is \( 9 - 3 = 6 \) units. Therefore, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) is \( \frac{6}{1} \), and the sum \( m + n \) is \( 6 + 1 = 7 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 25 red and 25 blue chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at most one chip, and then ensure that the chips in each row and each column are of the same color. Finally, we need to consider the additional condition that if any additional chips are placed, they must violate at least one of the first two conditions.

### Step 1: Count the number of ways to place the chips such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip of each color

First, we need to count the number of ways to place 5 red chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one red chip. This is equivalent to counting the number of permutations of 5 elements, which is \(5!\). Similarly, the number of ways to place 5 blue chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one blue chip is also \(5!\).

Since the placement of red chips and blue chips are independent, the total number of ways to place the chips such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip of each color is:
\[
5! \times 5! = 120 \times 120 = 14400

### Step 2: Consider the additional condition

The additional condition states that if any additional chips are placed, they must violate at least one of the first two conditions. This means that the only valid configurations are those where each row and each column contains exactly one chip of each color. If we place any additional chip, it will either violate the condition that each row and each column contains exactly one chip of each color, or it will not violate the condition that each row and each column contains at most one chip.

Therefore, the number of valid configurations is simply the number of ways to place the chips such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip of each color, which is:
