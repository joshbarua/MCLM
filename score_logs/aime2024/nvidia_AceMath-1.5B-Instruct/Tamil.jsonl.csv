"To solve the problem, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables first:

- \( s \) is the speed of the car in km/h.
- \( t \) is the time in minutes the car spends in the lake.

We will use the relationship between distance, speed, and time, which is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

### Step 1: Set up the equations

1. **First scenario:**
   - The car travels at \( s \) km/h and spends \( t \) minutes in the lake.
   - The distance traveled in the lake is \( 9 \) km.
   - The time spent in the lake is \( t \) minutes, which is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours.
   - The distance traveled in the lake is also \( s \times \frac{t}{60} \) km.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     s \times \frac{t}{60} = 9
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     st = 540 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

2. **Second scenario:**
   - The car travels at \( s + 2 \) km/h and spends \( 2 \) minutes in the lake.
   - The distance traveled in the lake is \( 9 \) km.
   - The time spent in the lake is \( 2 \) minutes, which is \( \frac{2}{60} = \frac{1}{30} \) hours.
   - The distance traveled in the lake is also \( (s + 2) \times \frac{1}{30} \) km.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     (s + 2) \times \frac{1}{30} = 9
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     s + 2 = 270
     \]
     \[
     s = 268 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

3. **Third scenario:**
   - The car travels at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h and spends \( t \) minutes in the lake.
   - The distance traveled in the lake is \( 9 \) km.
   - The time spent in the lake is \( t \) minutes, which is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours.
   - The distance traveled in the lake is also \( \left(s + \frac{1}{2}\right) \times \frac{t}{60} \) km.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \left(s + \frac{1}{2}\right) \times \frac{t}{60} = 9
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \left(268 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \times \frac{t}{60} = 9
     \]
     \[
     268.5 \times \frac{t}{60} = 9
     \]
     \[
     268.5t = 540
     \]
     \[
     t = \frac{540}{268.5}
     \]
     \[
     t = \frac{5400}{2685}
     \]
     \[
     t = \frac{1080}{537}
     \]
     \[
     t = \frac{360}{179}
     \]

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given problem, we start by using the properties of the circumcircle and the power of a point theorem. Let's denote the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\) as \(\omega\), and the center of \(\omega\) as \(O\). The point \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\), and \(P\) is the intersection of \(AD\) with \(\omega\).

First, we use the fact that \(D\) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle \(\omega\) and the circle with diameter \(BC\). The power of point \(A\) with respect to \(\omega\) is given by:
\[
AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC
\]
We know \(AB = 5\), \(AC = 10\), and we need to find \(AD\). The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle:
\[
AD = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + 10^2 + 9^2} = \sqrt{25 + 100 + 81} = \sqrt{206}
\]
Now, we substitute \(AB\), \(AC\), and \(AD\) into the power of point formula:
\[
AP \cdot \sqrt{206} = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
\]
Solving for \(AP\), we get:
\[
AP = \frac{50}{\sqrt{206}} = \frac{50 \sqrt{206}}{206} = \frac{25 \sqrt{206}}{103}
\]
Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 103\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 25 + 103 = 128

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the last white vertex is the first one to be visited in a random walk on a regular octagon (8-sided polygon) where each vertex is equally likely to be white or black.

First, let's label the vertices of the octagon as \( V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4, V_5, V_6, V_7, V_8 \) in a clockwise manner. We need to find the probability that the last white vertex is \( V_8 \), given that the walk starts at \( V_1 \) and each vertex is independently white with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).

This problem can be approached using the concept of a random walk on a graph and the properties of Markov chains. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the probability of reaching a specific vertex last in a random walk on a regular graph is proportional to the number of vertices of the same color.

Since the octagon is regular and each vertex is equally likely to be white or black, the probability of reaching any specific white vertex last is the same. There are 4 white vertices and 4 black vertices in the octagon. Therefore, the probability that the last white vertex is \( V_8 \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{4} \), which can be written as \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 4 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 4 = 5 \).

"To determine the number of solutions to the system of equations \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} + x \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} + x \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at these values:
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq \sin(2\pi x) < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - \sin(2\pi x) \).
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) < -\frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} + \sin(2\pi x) \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
Now, we need to evaluate \( g(x) \) at the values obtained from \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- For \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq f(\sin(2\pi x)) < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).
- For \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) < -\frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} + f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
Similarly, we need to evaluate \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) and then find the corresponding \( x \).

### Step 6: Solve the system of equations
To find the number of solutions, we need to consider the periodicity and symmetry of the functions involved. The functions \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \) are periodic with periods 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\), respectively. Therefore, we need to consider the behavior of the functions over one period of \( x \) and \( y \).

By analyzing the behavior of the functions and their compositions, we can determine that there are 4 solutions to the system of equations.

Thus, the number of solutions is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some integer \( n \), and then find the smallest integer \( m \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \).

First, let's consider the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since \( n \) is an integer, we need to consider the factorization over the integers. We can use the identity:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + n\sqrt{-1} + 1)(n^2 - n\sqrt{-1} + 1).
\]
But for integer \( n \), we can use the factorization:
\[

"To find the height of the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with given edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we can use the fact that the height from the vertex \(I\) to any face of the tetrahedron is the same. This implies that \(I\) is the incenter of the tetrahedron.

First, we calculate the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The determinant is given by:
\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\
1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\
1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\
1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Substituting the given edge lengths, we get:
\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we find:
\[
288 V^2 = -288 \cdot 41 \cdot 89 \cdot 41 \cdot 89
\]
\[
V^2 = 41 \cdot 89 \cdot 41 \cdot 89
\]
\[
V = 41 \cdot 89
\]
\[
V = 3649
\]

Next, we calculate the surface area \(S\) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. Each face is an isosceles triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). The area of one such triangle can be found using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]
The area \(A\) of one face is:
\[
A = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})}
\]
However, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)}
\]
Substituting \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), and \(c = \sqrt{89}\), we get:
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24 \sqrt{21}
\]
\[
A = 6 \sqrt{21}
\]
The total surface area \(S\) is:
\[
S = 4 \cdot 6 \sqrt{21} = 24 \sqrt{21}
\]

The height \(h\) of the tetrahedron is given by:
\[
h = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \cdot 3649}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{3649}{8 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{3649 \sqrt{21}}{168}
\]

Thus, the height is \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\) where \(m = 3649\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 168\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 3649 + 21 + 168 = 3838\).

\[ r = R \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{n} \right) \]

Here, \( n = 54 \) and \( R = 23 \). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ r = 23 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{54} \right) \]

We need to find \( r^2 \):

\[ r^2 = \left( 23 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{54} \right) \right)^2 = 529 \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{54} \right) \]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2} \), we can rewrite \( r^2 \) as:

\[ r^2 = 529 \cdot \frac{1 + \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{54} \right)}{2} = 529 \cdot \frac{1 + \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{27} \right)}{2} = \frac{529}{2} \left( 1 + \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{27} \right) \right) \]

The value of \( \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{27} \right) \) is not a simple fraction, but we can express \( r^2 \) in the form \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. Here, \( p = 529 \left( 1 + \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{27} \right) \right) \) and \( q = 2 \). Since 529 is \( 23^2 \), it is not divisible by 2, so \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime.

Thus, \( p = 529 \left( 1 + \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{27} \right) \right) \) and \( q = 2 \), and the sum \( p + q \) is:

\[ p + q = 529 \left( 1 + \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{27} \right) \right) + 2 \]

However, the problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction in its simplest form, which is \( 529 + 2 = 531 \).

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{531} \]","[531, '531']",721,"[721, '721']",False
"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Next, we apply the property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Similarly, \(\log_y(x)\) is the exponent to which \(y\) must be raised to get \(x\), so \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)\)
2. \(4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)\)

We can solve this system by eliminating one of the variables. First, we solve the first equation for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \left(\frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\right)
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]

Solving for \(y\), we get:

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now we substitute \(y = \frac{25}{x}\) back into the expression for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

We know that \(y = \frac{25}{x}\), so \(\log(y) = \log\left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = \log(25) - \log(x) = 2 \log(5) - \log(x)\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

To find a solution, we can test possible values of \(x\). Let's try \(x = 5\):

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(5) = \frac{10 \log(5)}{5}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\log(5) = 2 \log(5)
\]

This is not true, so \(x = 5\) is not a solution. Let's try \(x = 10\):

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of possible values of \( n \) such that the number of ways to distribute \( n \) dominoes into two players, where each player receives either 1 or 4 dominoes, is equal to 2024. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's define the problem more clearly. We have \( n \) dominoes, and we need to distribute them between two players, Alice and Bob. Alice receives either 1 or 4 dominoes, and Bob receives the remaining dominoes. Therefore, if Alice receives 1 domino, Bob receives \( n-1 \) dominoes, and if Alice receives 4 dominoes, Bob receives \( n-4 \) dominoes.

The number of ways to distribute the dominoes is the number of ways to choose 1 or 4 dominoes out of \( n \) for Alice, which is simply the number of ways to choose 1 domino out of \( n \) plus the number of ways to choose 4 dominoes out of \( n \). This can be expressed as:
\[
\binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{4} = n + \binom{n}{4}
\]
We are given that this number is equal to 2024:
\[
n + \binom{n}{4} = 2024
\]
The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{4}\) is given by:
\[
\binom{n}{4} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
n + \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} = 2024
\]
To clear the fraction, we multiply through by 24:
\[
24n + n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) = 48576
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) + 24n = 48576
\]
We need to find the integer values of \( n \) that satisfy this equation. Let's test some values of \( n \):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the two numbers that appear more frequently in the four randomly chosen numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \) are the same, given that the four numbers are chosen in such a way that they are the most frequent numbers in the set.

First, let's consider the possible scenarios for the four chosen numbers. Since the numbers are chosen to be the most frequent, they must appear more frequently than any other number in the set. This means that the four chosen numbers must be the four largest numbers in the set, i.e., \( \{7, 8, 9, 10\} \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 16 wooden planks in a \(8 \times 8\) grid such that there is a path from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner, and the path can only move right or up. This is a classic problem in combinatorics and can be solved using the concept of binomial coefficients.

A path from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid requires exactly 8 right moves and 8 up moves. The total number of such paths is the number of ways to arrange 8 right moves and 8 up moves in a sequence of 16 moves. This is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 16 for the right moves (or equivalently, the up moves).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{16}{8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
\[

(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 432\cos\theta).
\]

This can be written as:
\[
324(\cos\theta - \sin\theta) + 324i(\sin\theta + \cos\theta) = 324(\cos\theta - \sin\theta)(1 + i).
\]

To find the minimum value of the magnitude of this complex number, we need to find the minimum value of \( |324(\cos\theta - \sin\theta)(1 + i)| \). The magnitude of \( 1 + i \) is:
\[
|1 + i| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}.
\]

Therefore, the magnitude of the expression is:
\[
324\sqrt{2}|\cos\theta - \sin\theta|.
\]

The minimum value of \( |\cos\theta - \sin\theta| \) is 0, which occurs when \( \cos\theta = \sin\theta \). Thus, the minimum value of the expression is:
\[
324\sqrt{2} \cdot 0 = 0.
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",540,"[540, '540']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the circumradius \( R \) of the triangle \( ABC \) given the conditions about the inscribed circles and the number of circles.

First, let's denote the sides of the triangle \( ABC \) as \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), and \( c = AB \). The semiperimeter \( s \) of the triangle is given by:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]

The area \( K \) of the triangle can be expressed using Heron's formula:
\[ K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]

The circumradius \( R \) of the triangle is given by:
\[ R = \frac{abc}{4K} \]

We are given that the radius of the \( n \)-th inscribed circle is \( \frac{34}{n} \). The radius of the \( n \)-th inscribed circle of a triangle is given by:
\[ r_n = \frac{K}{s + \frac{a}{n} + \frac{b}{n} + \frac{c}{n}} = \frac{K}{s + \frac{a + b + c}{n}} = \frac{K}{s + \frac{2s}{n}} = \frac{K}{s \left(1 + \frac{2}{n}\right)} = \frac{K}{s} \cdot \frac{n}{n+2} \]

Given that \( r_n = \frac{34}{n} \), we have:
\[ \frac{K}{s} \cdot \frac{n}{n+2} = \frac{34}{n} \]
\[ \frac{K}{s} = \frac{34}{n} \cdot \frac{n+2}{n} = \frac{34(n+2)}{n^2} \]

We are also given that the radius of the \( 2024 \)-th inscribed circle is \( \frac{1}{2024} \). Therefore:
\[ r_{2024} = \frac{K}{s} \cdot \frac{2024}{2024+2} = \frac{K}{s} \cdot \frac{2024}{2026} = \frac{K}{s} \cdot \frac{1012}{1013} = \frac{1}{2024} \]
\[ \frac{K}{s} = \frac{1}{2024} \cdot \frac{1013}{1012} = \frac{1013}{2024 \cdot 1012} = \frac{1013}{2048288} \]

Equating the two expressions for \( \frac{K}{s} \):
\[ \frac{34(n+2)}{n^2} = \frac{1013}{2048288} \]
\[ 34(n+2) \cdot 2048288 = 1013 \cdot n^2 \]
\[ 70001712(n+2) = 1013n^2 \]
\[ 70001712n + 140003424 = 1013n^2 \]
\[ 1013n^2 - 70001712n - 140003424 = 0 \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1013 \), \( b = -70001712 \), and \( c = -140003424 \):
\[ n = \frac{70001712 \pm \sqrt{70001712^2 - 4 \cdot 1013 \cdot (-140003424)}}{2 \cdot 1013} \]
\[ n = \frac{70001712 \pm \sqrt{490020000000000 + 5656137216}}{2026} \]
\[ n = \frac{70001712 \pm \sqrt{490025656137216}}{2026} \]
\[ n = \frac{70001712 \pm 2213640}{2026} \]

We take the positive root:
\[ n = \frac{70001712 + 2213640}{2026} = \frac{72215352}{2026} = 3576 \]

Now, we substitute \( n = 3576 \) back into the expression for \( \frac{K}{s} \):
\[ \frac{K}{s} = \frac{1013}{2048288} \]

The area \( K \) of the triangle is:
\[ K = \frac{1013}{2048288} \cdot s \]

The circumradius \( R \) is:
\[ R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot \frac{1013}{2048288} \cdot s} = \frac{abc \cdot 2048288}{4 \cdot 1013 \cdot s} = \frac{abc \cdot 512072}{1013 \cdot s} \]

Since \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), we have:
\[ R = \frac{abc \cdot 512072}{1013 \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2}} = \frac{2abc \cdot 512072}{1013 \cdot (a + b + c)} \]

However, we can use the fact that \( R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot \frac{1013}{2048288} \cdot s} = \frac{abc \cdot 2048288}{4 \cdot 1013 \cdot s} = \frac{abc \cdot 512072}{1013 \cdot s} \)

Given that \( R = \frac{m}{n} \), we have:
\[ R = \frac{1013}{2026} \]

Thus, \( m = 1013 \) and \( n = 2026 \), and \( m + n = 1013 + 2026 = 3039 \).

\[ \boxed{3039} \]","[3039, '3039']",197,"[197, '197']",False
"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the minimum value of \(BD^2\) for a rectangle \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola with its center at the origin and its sides parallel to the asymptotes of the hyperbola.

First, let's identify the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The asymptotes of the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\) are given by \(y = \pm \frac{b}{a} x\). For our hyperbola, \(a^2 = 20\) and \(b^2 = 24\), so the asymptotes are \(y = \pm \frac{\sqrt{24}}{\sqrt{20}} x = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\).

Since the rectangle is inscribed in the hyperbola and its sides are parallel to the asymptotes, the vertices of the rectangle can be written as \((x, \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\), \((-x, \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\), \((-x, -\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\), and \((x, -\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\).

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) (or any other diagonal of the rectangle) is given by the distance between \((x, \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\) and \((-x, -\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\):
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x - (-\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\right)^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + \left(2\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\right)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{6}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + \frac{24}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{20}{5} x^2 + \frac{24}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{44}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{44}{5}} |x| = \frac{2\sqrt{11}}{\sqrt{5}} |x| = \frac{2\sqrt{55}}{5} |x|.
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{55}}{5} |x|\right)^2 = \frac{4 \cdot 55}{25} x^2 = \frac{220}{25} x^2 = \frac{44}{5} x^2\).

To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we need to determine the value of \(x^2\). Since the point \((x, \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{(\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)^2}{24} = 1\):
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{\frac{6}{5} x^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{6 x^2}{120} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{x^2}{20} = 1 \implies \frac{4 x^2}{20} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{5} = 1 \implies x^2 = 5.
\]
Substituting \(x^2 = 5\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44}{5} \cdot 5 = 44.
\]
Therefore, the minimum value of \(BD^2\) is \(\boxed{44}\).","[44, '44']",480,"[480, '480']",False
"To determine the number of players who have been to all four events in Emily's village, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of players who attended the painting event.
- Let \( B \) be the set of players who attended theknight's tour event.
- Let \( C \) be the set of players who attended the chess tournament.
- Let \( D \) be the set of players who attended the trivia quiz.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of players is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of players who attended the painting event is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of players who attended the knight's tour event is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of players who attended the chess tournament is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of players who attended the trivia quiz is \( |D| = 437 \).
- The number of players who attended the painting and knight's tour events is \( |A \cap B| = 437 \).
- The number of players who attended the painting and chess tournament events is \( |A \cap C| = 234 \).
- The number of players who attended the painting and trivia quiz events is \( |A \cap D| = 195 \).
- The number of players who attended the knight's tour and chess tournament events is \( |B \cap C| = 234 \).
- The number of players who attended the knight's tour and trivia quiz events is \( |B \cap D| = 195 \).
- The number of players who attended the chess tournament and trivia quiz events is \( |C \cap D| = 437 \).
- The number of players who attended all four events is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = x \).

We need to find the number of players who attended at least one of the four events, which is \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| \). According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Since we don't have the values of \( |A \cap B \cap C| \), \( |A \cap B \cap D| \), \( |A \cap C \cap D| \), and \( |B \cap C \cap D| \), we assume that the number of players who attended exactly three events is zero (because the problem does not provide this information and it simplifies the calculation). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|

Substituting the given values, we get:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - 437 - 234 - 195 - 234 - 195 - 437 + x

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - 437 - 234 - 195 - 234 - 195 - 437 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - 1504 + x = 1551 - 1504 + x = 47 + x
\]

Since the number of players who attended at least one of the four events cannot exceed the total number of players, we have:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| \leq 900
\]

Therefore:

\[
47 + x \leq 900
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x \leq 853

However, we need to find the exact number of players who attended all four events. Since the problem does not provide the values of \( |A \cap B \cap C| \), \( |A \cap B \cap D| \), \( |A \cap C \cap D| \), and \( |B \cap C \cap D| \), we assume that the number of players who attended exactly three events is zero (because the problem does not provide this information and it simplifies the calculation).

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( I \) and incenter \( O \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \), we need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). This implies that \( I \) lies on the circle with diameter \( \overline{OA} \). The length of \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). The distance \( IA \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( OIA \):
\[
IA^2 = OA^2 - OI^2 = 13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2 = 169 - 13 = 156
\]
Thus,
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) is also given by the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex of the triangle:
\[
IA = \sqrt{\frac{(bc(s-a))^2}{s(s-a)}}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle and \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the sides opposite to vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be expressed in terms of the sides and the inradius:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{bc}{\sin B} = \frac{bc}{\frac{2K}{a}} = \frac{bc \cdot a}{2K}
\]
where \( K \) is the area of the triangle. Using the formula for the area \( K \) in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter:
\[
K = r \cdot s
\]
we get:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{bc \cdot a}{2r \cdot s}
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be expressed in terms of the sides and the inradius:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{bc}{\sin B} = \frac{bc}{\frac{2K}{a}} = \frac{bc \cdot a}{2K}

"To solve for the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) of positive integers such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the given expression. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]

Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we can substitute this into the equation to get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]

Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we find:

\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we need to find all positive integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to the system of equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We can express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\) from the first equation:

\[
c = 300 - a - b.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we have:

\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]

To find integer solutions, we can use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are symmetric in the original equations. We can assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). We will test possible values for \(a\) and solve for \(b\) and \(c\).

First, let's try \(a = 100\):

\[
b^2 + 100b + 100c - 30,000 - 300b - 10,000 + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b + 100c - 20,000 = 0.
\]

Since \(c = 300 - 100 - b = 200 - b\), substitute \(c\) into the equation:

\[
b^2 - 200b + 100(200 - b) - 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b + 20,000 - 100b - 20,000 = 0,

\[
b^2 - 300b = 0,

\[
b(b - 300) = 0.

This gives us \(b = 0\) or \(b = 300\). Since \(b\) must be a positive integer, we have \(b = 300\). Then \(c = 200 - 300 = -100\), which is not a positive integer. Therefore, \(a = 100\) does not yield a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 100\):

\[
b^2 + 100b + 100c - 30,000 - 300b - 10,000 + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b + 100c - 20,000 = 0.
\]

Since \(c = 300 - 100 - b = 200 - b\), substitute \(c\) into the equation:

\[
b^2 - 200b + 100(200 - b) - 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b + 20,000 - 100b - 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 300b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 300) = 0.
\]

This gives us \(b = 0\) or \(b = 300\). Since \(b\) must be a positive integer, we have \(b = 300\). Then \(c = 200 - 300 = -100\), which is not a positive integer. Therefore, \(a = 100\) does not yield a valid solution.

Finally, let's try \(a = 100\):

\[
b^2 + 100b + 100c - 30,000 - 300b - 10,000 + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b + 100c - 20,000 = 0.
\]

Since \(c = 300 - 100 - b = 200 - b\), substitute \(c\) into the equation:

\[
b^2 - 200b + 100(200 - b) - 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b + 20,000 - 100b - 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 300b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 300) = 0.
\]

This gives us \(b = 0\) or \(b = 300\). Since \(b\) must be a positive integer, we have \(b = 300\). Then \(c = 200 - 300 = -100\), which is not a positive integer. Therefore, \(a = 100\) does not yield a valid solution.

The only valid solution is \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\). Therefore, the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) and then calculate \(OC^2\).

First, let's determine the coordinates of the point \(C\). The point \(C\) is the intersection of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) extended beyond \(B\) and the line \(y = x\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).

The equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\) can be found using the two-point form of the equation of a line:
\[
y - 0 = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3} \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

To find the coordinates of \(C\), we set \(y = x\) in the equation of the line:
\[
x = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x + \sqrt{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x(1 + \sqrt{3}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2(1 + \sqrt{3})} \implies x = \frac{\sqrt{3}(1 - \sqrt{3})}{2(1 + \sqrt{3})(1 - \sqrt{3})} \implies x = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 3}{2(1 - 3)} \implies x = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 3}{-4} \implies x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4}.
\]

Since \(y = x\), the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4}, \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\).

Next, we calculate \(OC^2\), where \(O\) is the origin \((0,0)\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = 2 \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{(3 - \sqrt{3})^2}{16} = \frac{(3 - \sqrt{3})^2}{8} = \frac{9 - 6\sqrt{3} + 3}{8} = \frac{12 - 6\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{6(2 - \sqrt{3})}{8} = \frac{3(2 - \sqrt{3})}{4}.
\]

Thus, \(OC^2 = \frac{6 - 3\sqrt{3}}{4}\). Here, \(p = 6\) and \(q = 4\), so \(p + q = 10\).

\boxed{10}.

"To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\), where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, \(\omega \neq 1\). The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} = 1\), which can be written as \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). This factors as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the 13th roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 13}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Let's denote this product by \(P\). We can rewrite the expression inside the product as:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.\]

However, a more useful approach is to consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of \(Q(x)\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to evaluate the product:
\[P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(Q(x)\) can be written as:
\[Q(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}.\]

To find \(P\), we can use the fact that the polynomial \(2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at the roots of \(Q(x)\) can be related to the polynomial \(Q(x)\). Specifically, we can use the fact that the product of \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\) is equal to the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at the roots of \(Q(x)\).

By symmetry and properties of roots of unity, we can use the fact that the product of \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\) is equal to \(13^6\). Therefore, the value of \(P\) is:
\[P = 13^6.\]

To find the remainder when \(13^6\) is divided by 1000, we can use modular arithmetic. We have:
\[13^2 = 169,\]
\[13^4 = 169^2 = 28561 \equiv 561 \pmod{1000},\]
\[13^6 = 13^4 \cdot 13^2 \equiv 561 \cdot 169 = 94909 \equiv 909 \pmod{1000}.\]

"To determine the largest \( b \ge 2 \) such that there exists a \( b \)-beautiful number \( n \) with the property that the sum of its digits in base \( b \) is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it can be expressed in base \( b \) as \( d_k d_{k-1} \ldots d_1 d_0 \) (where \( d_i \) are the digits) and the sum of its digits \( d_k + d_{k-1} + \ldots + d_1 + d_0 \) is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

2. ** bounds for \( n \):**
   - Since \( n \) is a \( b \)-beautiful number, \( n \) must be a perfect square and the sum of its digits in base \( b \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - The maximum digit in base \( b \) is \( b-1 \). If \( n \) has \( k+1 \) digits in base \( b \), then \( n \) is at most \( (b-1)(b^k + b^{k-1} + \ldots + b + 1) = (b-1) \frac{b^{k+1} - 1}{b-1} = b^{k+1} - 1 \).
   - The sum of the digits is at most \( k(b-1) \). Therefore, we must have \( k(b-1) \le \sqrt{n} \le b^{k+1} - 1 \).

3. **Finding the largest \( b \):**
   - We need to find the largest \( b \) such that there exists a \( b \)-beautiful number \( n \). Let's test the values of \( b \) starting from the largest possible values and work our way down.

4. **Testing \( b = 13 \):**
   - We already know that \( 81 \) is \( 13 \)-beautiful because \( 81 = 63_{13} \) and \( 6 + 3 = \sqrt{81} = 9 \).
   - Let's check if there is a larger \( b \) that works. For \( b = 14 \), the maximum digit is \( 13 \). If \( n \) has \( k+1 \) digits in base \( 14 \), then \( n \) is at most \( 13(b^k + b^{k-1} + \ldots + b + 1) = 13 \frac{b^{k+1} - 1}{b-1} \). The sum of the digits is at most \( k \cdot 13 \). Therefore, we must have \( k \cdot 13 \le \sqrt{n} \le 13 \frac{b^{k+1} - 1}{b-1} \).
   - For \( b = 14 \), the sum of the digits \( k \cdot 13 \) must be less than or equal to \( \sqrt{13 \frac{b^{k+1} - 1}{b-1}} \). This inequality is not satisfied for any \( k \) because the right-hand side grows much faster than the left-hand side.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest \( b \) for which there exists a \( b \)-beautiful number is \( b = 13 \).

"To determine the number of squares in a regular 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) such that each side of the square is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the geometric properties and symmetries of the dodecagon.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A square in this dodecagon must have its sides as either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. This means that the vertices of the square must be vertices of the dodecagon such that the distance between any two consecutive vertices of the square is either 1 (for a side) or 5 (for a diagonal) in terms of the number of vertices between them.

We can start by considering the vertex \( A_1 \) and find all possible vertices of the square that can be connected to \( A_1 \) with sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. The possible vertices are \( A_2, A_3, A_6, \) and \( A_7 \) (since \( A_1 \) to \( A_2 \) is 1, \( A_1 \) to \( A_3 \) is 1, \( A_1 \) to \( A_6 \) is 5, and \( A_1 \) to \( A_7 \) is 5).

For each of these vertices, we can form a square by connecting the next vertex in the sequence. For example, if we start with \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \), the next vertex is \( A_3 \) and the next vertex is \( A_4 \), forming the square \( A_1A_2A_3A_4 \). Similarly, if we start with \( A_1 \) and \( A_3 \), the next vertex is \( A_4 \) and the next vertex is \( A_5 \), forming the square \( A_1A_3A_4A_5 \). If we start with \( A_1 \) and \( A_6 \), the next vertex is \( A_7 \) and the next vertex is \( A_8 \), forming the square \( A_1A_6A_7A_8 \). Finally, if we start with \( A_1 \) and \( A_7 \), the next vertex is \( A_8 \) and the next vertex is \( A_9 \), forming the square \( A_1A_7A_8A_9 \).

Thus, for each of the 4 possible starting vertices, we can form a square. Therefore, the total number of squares is \( 4 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of the squares of all the positive integers in the given arithmetic sequence. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the arithmetic sequence:**
   - The common difference \(d\) is 9.
   - The sum of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)
     \]
     where \(a\) is the first term and \(n\) is the number of terms.
   - We know that the sum of the first \(n\) terms is 30:
     \[
     S_n = 30
     \]
   - Substituting the known values into the sum formula, we get:
     \[
     \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1) \cdot 9) = 30
     \]
     Simplifying, we have:
     \[
     n (2a + 9n - 9) = 60
     \]

2. **Determine the number of terms \(n\):**
   - Since \(n\) must be a positive integer, we need to find values of \(n\) that satisfy the equation \(n (2a + 9n - 9) = 60\).
   - Let's test possible values of \(n\):
     - If \(n = 1\):
       \[
       1 (2a + 9 \cdot 1 - 9) = 60 \implies 2a = 60 \implies a = 30
       \]
       The sequence is \(30\), and the sum is 30.
     - If \(n = 2\):
       \[
       2 (2a + 9 \cdot 2 - 9) = 60 \implies 2 (2a + 9) = 60 \implies 2a + 9 = 30 \implies 2a = 21 \implies a = 10.5
       \]
       \(a\) is not an integer, so this is not a valid solution.
     - If \(n = 3\):
       \[
       3 (2a + 9 \cdot 3 - 9) = 60 \implies 3 (2a + 18) = 60 \implies 2a + 18 = 20 \implies 2a = 2 \implies a = 1
       \]
       The sequence is \(1, 10, 19\), and the sum is \(1 + 10 + 19 = 30\).
     - If \(n = 4\):
       \[
       4 (2a + 9 \cdot 4 - 9) = 60 \implies 4 (2a + 27) = 60 \implies 2a + 27 = 15 \implies 2a = -12 \implies a = -6
       \]
       \(a\) is not a positive integer, so this is not a valid solution.
     - For \(n \geq 5\), the term \(2a + 9n - 9\) will be negative, making \(a\) negative, which is not possible.

   Therefore, the possible values of \(n\) are 1 and 3. Since we are looking for the sum of the squares of all the positive integers in the sequence, we discard \(n = 1\) because it does not provide a sequence with multiple terms. So, \(n = 3\) and the sequence is \(1, 10, 19\).

3. **Calculate the sum of the squares of the terms:**
   \[
   1^2 + 10^2 + 19^2 = 1 + 100 + 361 = 462

\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline

We are given two conditions:
1. The sum of the digits in each row is 999.
2. The sum of the digits in each column is 99.

From the first condition, we have:
\[ a + b + c = 999 \]
\[ d + e + f = 999 \]

From the second condition, we have:
\[ a + d = 99 \]
\[ b + e = 99 \]
\[ c + f = 99 \]

We can start by expressing \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[ d = 99 - a \]
\[ e = 99 - b \]
\[ f = 99 - c \]

Substituting these into the row sums, we get:
\[ a + b + c = 999 \]
\[ (99 - a) + (99 - b) + (99 - c) = 999 \]

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ 297 - (a + b + c) = 999 \]
\[ 297 - 999 = a + b + c \]
\[ -702 = a + b + c \]

This is a contradiction because \(a + b + c\) cannot be both 999 and -702. Therefore, there is no 2x3 grid of digits that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

"To solve the given problem, we start with the three equations involving logarithms:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]

So,

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = 1
\]

This equation is not correct, which indicates a mistake in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem by solving for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) directly from the original equations.

From \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we get:

\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Substitute \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
y = (yz \sqrt{2}) z 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Since \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[
1 = z^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Substitute \(z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\) into \(1 = z^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
1 = (xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}})^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = x^2 y^2 2^{\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\frac{1}{4}} \sqrt{2} = x^2 y^2 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}} = x^2 y^2 2^{\frac{5}{4}}
\]

Since \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\), substitute \(z = \frac{1}{y^2 2^{\frac{5}{4}}}\) into \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\):

\[
x = y \left(\frac{1}{y^2 2^{\frac{5}{4}}}\right) \sqrt{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{y 2^{\frac{5}{4}}} = \frac{2^{\frac{1}{2}}}{y 2^{\frac{5}{4}}} = \frac{2^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{4}}}{y} = \frac{2^{-\frac{3}{4}}}{y}
\]

Now, substitute \(x = \frac{2^{-\frac{3}{4}}}{y}\) and \(z = \frac{1}{y^2 2^{\frac{5}{4}}}\) into \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = \left(\frac{2^{-\frac{3}{4}}}{y}\right)^4 = \frac{2^{-3}}{y^4} = \frac{1}{8y^4}
\]
\[
y^3 = y^3
\]
\[
z^2 = \left(\frac{1}{y^2 2^{\frac{5}{4}}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{y^4 2^{\frac{5}{2}}}
\]

So,

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8y^4}\right) y^3 \left(\frac{1}{y^4 2^{\frac{5}{2}}}\right) = \frac{1}{8y^5 2^{\frac{5}{2}}} = \frac{1}{8y^5 4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{32y^5 \sqrt{2}}
\]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{5}{4}}}\), substitute \(y = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{5}{4}}}\) into \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = \frac{1}{32 \left(\frac{1}{2^{\frac{5}{4}}}\right)^5 \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{32 \cdot \frac{1}{2^{\frac{25}{4}}} \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{32 \cdot \frac{1}{2^{\frac{25}{4}}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1}{32 \cdot \frac{1}{2^{\frac{25}{4} + \frac{1}{2}}}} = \frac{1}{32 \cdot \frac{1}{2^{\frac{27}{4}}}} = \frac{1}{32 \cdot 2^{-\frac{27}{4}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{27}{4} - 5}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{27}{4} - \frac{20}{4}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{7}{4}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{7}{4}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{7}{4}}}

The absolute value is:

\[
\left| \log_2 \left( \frac{1}{2^{\frac{7}{4}}} \right) \right| = \left| -\frac{7}{4} \right| = \frac{7}{4}

We are also given that \( B \) has 2024 divisors. We need to find the number of divisors of \( A \), which is \( A \) itself.

To find \( A \), we need to consider the properties of the divisor function. The number of divisors function is multiplicative, meaning that if \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then the number of divisors of \( n \) is \( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) \).

We need to find a number \( A \) such that there exists a number \( n \) with \( A \) divisors and a number \( m \) with more than \( A \) divisors. The number 2024 can be factored as \( 2024 = 2^3 \cdot 11 \cdot 23 \). This means that there exists a number \( m \) with 2024 divisors.

To find the number of divisors of \( A \), we need to consider the possible values of \( A \) that are less than 2024 and have a corresponding number \( n \) with fewer divisors. The number \( A \) must be a product of integers of the form \( e_i + 1 \) where \( e_i \) are positive integers. The smallest such number is 1, which corresponds to the number 1 itself, which has 1 divisor.

Therefore, the number of divisors of \( A \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",55,"[55, '55']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( N \) that meets the following conditions:
1. When \( N \) is decreased by 1, the result is divisible by 7.
2. When \( N \) is divided by 1000, the quotient is a prime number \( Q \) and the remainder is a positive integer \( R \) such that \( R < Q \).

First, let's express the conditions mathematically:
1. \( N - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), which means \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).
2. \( N = 1000Q + R \) where \( Q \) is a prime number and \( R \) is a positive integer such that \( R < Q \).

We need to find the smallest \( N \) that satisfies both conditions. Let's start by testing the smallest prime numbers for \( Q \).

### Case 1: \( Q = 2 \)
If \( Q = 2 \), then \( N = 1000 \cdot 2 + R = 2000 + R \). We need \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \), so:
\[ 2000 + R \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
First, we find the remainder when 2000 is divided by 7:
\[ 2000 \div 7 = 285 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
So, \( 2000 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \). Therefore:
\[ 5 + R \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv 1 - 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv -4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
The smallest positive \( R \) is 3. Thus, \( N = 2000 + 3 = 2003 \).

### Case 2: \( Q = 3 \)
If \( Q = 3 \), then \( N = 1000 \cdot 3 + R = 3000 + R \). We need \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \), so:
\[ 3000 + R \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
First, we find the remainder when 3000 is divided by 7:
\[ 3000 \div 7 = 428 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
So, \( 3000 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \). Therefore:
\[ 4 + R \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv 1 - 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv -3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
The smallest positive \( R \) is 4. Thus, \( N = 3000 + 4 = 3004 \).

### Case 3: \( Q = 5 \)
If \( Q = 5 \), then \( N = 1000 \cdot 5 + R = 5000 + R \). We need \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \), so:
\[ 5000 + R \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
First, we find the remainder when 5000 is divided by 7:
\[ 5000 \div 7 = 714 \text{ remainder } 2 \]
So, \( 5000 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). Therefore:
\[ 2 + R \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv 1 - 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ R \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
The smallest positive \( R \) is 6. Thus, \( N = 5000 + 6 = 5006 \).

### Conclusion
Among the values 2003, 3004, and 5006, the smallest is 2003. Therefore, \( N = 2003 \).

Now, we need to find \( Q + R \):
\[ Q = 2 \]
\[ R = 3 \]
\[ Q + R = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the difference in the radii of the two circles \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) and then find the sum \( m + n \) where \( r_i - r_o = \frac{m}{n} \).

First, let's identify the given information:
- The radius of the inner circle \( S \) is \( 11 \) units.
- The radius of the outer circle \( T \) is \( 6 \) units.
- The inner circle \( T \) is tangent to the inner circle \( S \) at a point \( P \).
- The inner circle \( T \) is also tangent to the line segment \( OP \) at a point \( Q \), where \( O \) is the center of the inner circle \( S \).

Since the inner circle \( T \) is tangent to the inner circle \( S \) at point \( P \), the distance between the centers \( O \) and \( O' \) (where \( O' \) is the center of the inner circle \( T \)) is \( 11 - 6 = 5 \) units.

Next, we need to find the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the two circles \( S \) and \( T \) respectively, given that they are tangent to the line segment \( OP \) at points \( Q \) and \( R \) respectively.

The radius \( r_i \) of the inner circle \( S \) is given as \( 11 \) units. The radius \( r_o \) of the outer circle \( T \) is given as \( 6 \) units.

The difference in the radii is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 11 - 6 = 5 \]

Thus, we have:
\[ r_i - r_o = \frac{5}{1} \]

Here, \( m = 5 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, the sum \( m + n \) is:
\[ m + n = 5 + 1 = 6 \]

The final answer is:

\boxed{6}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 25 out of 50 chess pieces (12.5 black and 12.5 white) such that each row and each column contains at least one black and one white piece. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We have a \(5 \times 5\) grid, and we need to place 25 chess pieces (12.5 black and 12.5 white) such that each row and each column contains at least one black and one white piece. Since we can't have half a piece, we need to consider the problem in a way that allows for this condition to be met.

### Step 2: Placing the Pieces
To ensure that each row and each column contains at least one black and one white piece, we can use a checkerboard pattern. In a \(5 \times 5\) grid, a checkerboard pattern will have 13 pieces of one color and 12 pieces of the other color. However, since we need exactly 12.5 black and 12.5 white pieces, we need to consider a different approach.

### Step 3: Using a Combinatorial Approach
We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid configurations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the problem is symmetric and that the number of valid configurations is the same as the number of ways to place 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces such that each row and each column contains at least one black and one white piece.

### Step 4: Calculating the Number of Valid Configurations
The number of ways to place 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at least one black and one white piece is given by the number of ways to place 12 black pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at least one black piece, and then place the white pieces in the remaining cells.

The number of ways to place 12 black pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at least one black piece is given by the number of ways to place 12 black pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at least one black piece, which is a well-known problem in combinatorial mathematics.

The number of ways to place 12 black pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at least one black piece is given by the number of ways to place 12 black pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at least one black piece, which is a well-known problem in combinatorial mathematics.

### Step 5: Final Answer
The number of valid configurations is given by the number of ways to place 12 black pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at least one black piece, and then place the white pieces in the remaining cells. This is a well-known problem in combinatorial mathematics, and the answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]

This is because it is impossible to place 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at least one black and one white piece. Therefore, the number of valid configurations is 0.","[0, '0']",902,"[902, '902']",True
