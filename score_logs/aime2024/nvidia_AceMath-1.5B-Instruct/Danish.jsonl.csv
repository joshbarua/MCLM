"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Aya spends treading with the dog, including the time spent in the coffee shop, when she travels at different speeds. Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - \( s \) is the speed in kilometers per hour.
   - \( t \) is the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes.
   - \( d \) is the distance traveled before stopping in the coffee shop in kilometers.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - When Aya travels at \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time is 4 hours and \( t \) minutes. The time spent treading is \( \frac{d}{s} \) hours, and the time spent in the coffee shop is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Therefore, the total time is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
   - When Aya travels at \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. The time spent treading is \( \frac{d}{s+2} \) hours, and the time spent in the coffee shop is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Therefore, the total time is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
     \]

3. **Eliminate \( \frac{t}{60} \) from the equations:**
   - From the first equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \implies \frac{t}{60} = 4 - \frac{d}{s}
     \]
   - From the second equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \implies \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \frac{d}{s+2}
     \]
   - Set the two expressions for \( \frac{t}{60} \) equal to each other:
     \[
     4 - \frac{d}{s} = 2.4 - \frac{d}{s+2}
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     1.6 = \frac{d}{s} - \frac{d}{s+2}
     \]
     \[
     1.6 = d \left( \frac{(s+2) - s}{s(s+2)} \right)
     \]
     \[
     1.6 = d \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right)
     \]
     \[
     d = 0.8 s(s+2)
     \]

4. **Substitute \( d \) back into one of the original equations to find \( s \):**
   - Use the first equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
     \[
     \frac{0.8 s(s+2)}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
     \[
     0.8(s+2) + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
     \[
     0.8s + 1.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
     \[
     0.8s + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
     \]
     \[
     \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - 0.8s
     \]
   - Substitute \( \frac{t}{60} \) into the second equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
     \]
     \[
     \frac{0.8 s(s+2)}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
     \]
     \[
     0.8s + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4

     \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - 0.8s

"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we start by finding the area of triangle \(ABC\) using Heron's formula. First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):

\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]

Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\):

\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]

The area of a triangle can also be expressed as \(K = \frac{abc}{4R}\), where \(R\) is the circumradius. We can find \(R\) using the formula \(R = \frac{abc}{4K}\):

\[
R = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]

Now, we use the fact that \(P\) is the point where the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) intersects the circumcircle \(\omega\). The length \(AP\) can be found using the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle, but a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(AP\) is the length of the segment from the vertex \(A\) to the point where the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) intersects the circumcircle. This length is given by:

\[
AP = \frac{bc}{b+c} \cdot \frac{a}{a + b + c}
\]

However, a more straightforward formula for \(AP\) in this context is:

\[
AP = \frac{bc}{b+c} \cdot \frac{a}{a + b + c} = \frac{bc}{b+c} \cdot \frac{a}{a + b + c} = \frac{9 \cdot 10}{9 + 10} \cdot \frac{5}{5 + 9 + 10} = \frac{90}{19} \cdot \frac{5}{24} = \frac{450}{456} = \frac{75}{76}
\]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{75}{76}\). The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 75 and 76, respectively, and their sum is:

\[
m + n = 75 + 76 = 151

"To solve the problem, we need to consider the properties of a regular octagon and the possible colorings of its vertices. An octagon has 8 vertices, and each vertex can be either red or blue with equal probability. We are interested in the probability that after roting the octagon, all the blue vertices end up in positions where there were originally red vertices.

First, let's label the vertices of the octagon as \( V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4, V_5, V_6, V_7, V_8 \) in a clockwise manner. We need to find the number of colorings such that if the octagon is rotated, all blue vertices end up in positions where there were originally red vertices.

A key insight is that the coloring must be such that the sequence of colors is a palindrome. This is because a rotation of the octagon will map each position to another position, and for the condition to be satisfied, the color of each vertex must match the color of the vertex that is the same distance from the center but on the opposite side of the octagon.

For an octagon, a palindrome of length 8 can be formed by choosing a sequence of 4 colors, and then repeating this sequence in reverse order. Therefore, there are \( 2^4 = 16 \) possible palindromic colorings of the octagon.

Next, we need to determine the total number of possible colorings of the octagon. Since each vertex can be either red or blue, there are \( 2^8 = 256 \) possible colorings.

The probability that a randomly chosen coloring is a palindrome is the ratio of the number of palindromic colorings to the total number of colorings:
\[
\frac{16}{256} = \frac{1}{16}
\]

We are given that this probability can be expressed as \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers. Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 16 \), so \( m + n = 1 + 16 = 17 \).

"To find the number of intersection points between the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \]

Next, we need to find the compositions \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \):
\[ f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \]
Since \( |\sin(2 \pi x)| \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, we find \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \):
\[ g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \left| |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{4} \]
Since \( |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \left| |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) ranges from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \).

Similarly, we find \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \):
\[ f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \]
Since \( |\cos(3 \pi y)| \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, we find \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
\[ g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \left| |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{4} \]
Since \( |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \left| |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) ranges from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, we need to find the number of solutions to the equation:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]

Since both \( y \) and \( x \) range from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \), we need to determine how many times the line \( y = x \) intersects the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) within this range.

The function \( g(f(x)) \) is symmetric about \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \), and it is periodic with period 1. Therefore, the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will intersect at the points where \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \cos(3 \pi y) \).

Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) are periodic with periods 1 and \( \frac{2}{3} \) respectively, they will intersect at 6 points in the interval \( [0, 1) \). Therefore, the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will intersect at 6 points.

Thus, the number of intersection points is:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given condition that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) for some prime \( p \) and positive integer \( n \). We need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is also divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, it is more useful to consider the factorization over the integers modulo \( p \).

We know that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), which implies \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}.
\]
This means that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the order cannot be 1, 2, or 4. Therefore, the order must be 8.

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), which is equivalent to \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). From the above analysis, we know that \( m \) must have the same order as \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \), which is 8. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( m \) that satisfies this condition is the same as the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \).

Thus, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is:

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its faces, we start by calculating the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron and the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The distance \( r \) from the incenter to each face is given by the formula:

\[ r = \frac{3V}{S} \]

First, we use the given edge lengths to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The edge lengths are \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \). We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume of the tetrahedron. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with vertices \( A, B, C, D \) is given by:

\[ \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\
1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\
1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\
1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = 0 \]

Substituting the given edge lengths, we get:

\[ \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = 0 \]

Expanding this determinant, we find that it indeed equals zero, confirming that the given edge lengths form a valid tetrahedron. The volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron can be found using the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{4 \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 \\
1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 \\
1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}} \]

Calculating the determinant inside the square root, we get:

\[ \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = -16200 \]

Thus, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{4 \cdot 16200} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 120 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is an isosceles triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). The area of one such triangle can be found using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle is:

\[ s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the triangle is:

\[ A = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})} \]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by:

\[ A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)} \]

Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[ A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 12 \sqrt{92} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 12 \cdot 2 \sqrt{23} = 6 \sqrt{23} \]

Since there are four faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:

\[ S = 4 \cdot 6 \sqrt{23} = 24 \sqrt{23} \]

Finally, the distance \( r \) from the incenter to each face is:

\[ r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \cdot 20}{24 \sqrt{23}} = \frac{60}{24 \sqrt{23}} = \frac{5}{2 \sqrt{23}} = \frac{5 \sqrt{23}}{46} \]

Thus, the distance \( r \) is in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 5 \), \( n = 23 \), and \( p = 46 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 5 + 23 + 46 = 74 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes in the set \(\mathcal{B}\), and then determine the value of \( r^2 \) in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \( p \) and \( q \) are relatively prime positive integers. Finally, we will find \( p + q \).

First, let's denote the dimensions of a rectangular box by \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The volume of the box is given by:
\[ abc = 23 \]
The surface area of the box is given by:
\[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \]
We need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain this box. The radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is given by:
\[ r = \frac{\sqrt{\left(\max(a, b, c)\right)^2 + \left(\max(a, b, c)\right)^2 + \left(\max(a, b, c)\right)^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3 \left(\max(a, b, c)\right)^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \max(a, b, c)}{2} \]
To find \( \max(a, b, c) \), we need to solve the system of equations:
\[ abc = 23 \]
\[ ab + bc + ca = 27 \]
We can use the fact that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0 \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0 \]
We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By trial and error or using numerical methods, we can find that the roots are approximately:
\[ a \approx 1, \quad b \approx 1, \quad c \approx 23 \]
However, this does not satisfy the surface area equation. Let's try another approach. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the sides is related to the surface area:
\[ ab + bc + ca = 27 \]
We can assume that the box is close to a cube, so let's try \( a = b = c \). Then:
\[ a^3 = 23 \implies a = \sqrt[3]{23} \]
\[ 3a^2 = 27 \implies a^2 = 9 \implies a = 3 \]
This does not satisfy \( a^3 = 23 \). Therefore, we need to find the correct dimensions. Let's try \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 23 \):

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\), we obtain:

\[
x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Next, we apply the same property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x)\) is the exponent to which \(y\) must be raised to get \(x\), we know that \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(y)\), we obtain:

\[
4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Now we have two equations:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

From the first equation, we can solve for \(\log_x(y)\):

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \(\log_y(x)\):

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\), we substitute \(\log_y(x)\) into this equation:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
10 \cdot 5 = 2y \cdot x
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
50 = 2xy
\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:

\[
xy = 25

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a strategy to guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions.

First, let's define the positions:
- A position is a ""winning position"" if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
- A position is a ""losing position"" if any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We start by identifying the base cases:
- If \( n = 1 \), Alice takes the only jeton and wins. Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 2 \), Alice can take 1 jeton and leave Bob with 1 jeton, which is a losing position for Bob. Therefore, \( n = 2 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 3 \), Alice can take 1 jeton and leave Bob with 2 jetons, which is a winning position for Bob. Therefore, \( n = 3 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 4 \), Alice can take 4 jetons and leave Bob with 0 jetons, which is a losing position for Bob. Therefore, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position.

From these base cases, we can see a pattern. Let's generalize this pattern:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), Alice can take 4 jetons and leave Bob with \( n - 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), which is a losing position for Bob. Therefore, \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) is a winning position.
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), Alice can take 1 jeton and leave Bob with \( n - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), which is a winning position for Bob. Therefore, \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) is a losing position.
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), Alice can take 1 jeton and leave Bob with \( n - 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), which is a losing position for Bob. Therefore, \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) is a winning position.
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), Alice can take 1 jeton and leave Bob with \( n - 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), which is a winning position for Bob. Therefore, \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) is a losing position.
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), Alice can take 4 jetons and leave Bob with \( n - 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), which is a winning position for Bob. Therefore, \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \) is a winning position.

From this analysis, we see that the losing positions are \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a strategy to guarantee a win is the number of integers \( n \) such that \( n \not\equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).

First, we find the number of integers \( n \) from 1 to 2024 that are congruent to 1 modulo 5. These integers form an arithmetic sequence: \( 1, 6, 11, \ldots, 2021 \). The number of terms in this sequence is given by:
\[
\frac{2021 - 1}{5} + 1 = 405
\]

Since there are 2024 integers from 1 to 2024, the number of integers that are not congruent to 1 modulo 5 is:
\[
2024 - 405 = 1619
\]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a strategy to guarantee a win is \(\boxed{1619}\).","[1619, '1619']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that Jen wins the hovedpræmien given that she has won at least one prize. Let's break this down step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210.
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of ways in which Jen wins the hovedpræmien. Jen wins the hovedpræmien if all four of the winning numbers are among the four numbers she selected. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that all four are the winning numbers is simply 1 (since there is only one way to choose all four winning numbers from the four winning numbers).

Now, we need to determine the number of ways in which Jen wins at least one prize. Jen wins at least one prize if either she wins the præmie or she wins the hovedpræmien. The number of ways in which Jen wins the præmie is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two of them are among the winning numbers. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of ways in which fewer than two of the chosen numbers are among the winning numbers from the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers.

The number of ways in which no two of the chosen numbers are among the winning numbers is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers that are not winning numbers):
\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15.
\]

The number of ways in which exactly one of the chosen numbers is among the winning numbers is the number of ways to choose 1 winning number from the 4 winning numbers and 3 non-winning numbers from the 6 non-winning numbers:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 4 \cdot 20 = 80.
\]

Therefore, the number of ways in which Jen wins the præmie is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} - \binom{6}{4} - \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 210 - 15 - 80 = 115.
\]

Adding the number of ways in which Jen wins the hovedpræmien, the total number of ways in which Jen wins at least one prize is:
\[
115 + 1 = 116.
\]

The probability that Jen wins the hovedpræmien given that she has won at least one prize is:
\[
\frac{1}{116}.

Since 1 and 116 are relatively prime, the probability is in its simplest form. Therefore, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 116 \), and the sum \( m + n \) is:

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.

First, let's denote the coordinates of the points:
- \(A = (0, 0)\)
- \(B = (107, 0)\)
- \(C = (107, 16)\)
- \(D = (0, 16)\)

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the slope of \(DC\) is the same as the slope of \(EF\). The slope of \(DC\) is:
\[
\text{slope of } DC = \frac{16 - 0}{107 - 0} = \frac{16}{107}
\]

The slope of \(EF\) is:
\[
\text{slope of } EF = \frac{184 - 0}{17 - 107} = \frac{184}{-90} = -\frac{92}{45}
\]

Since the slopes are equal, we have:
\[
\frac{16}{107} = -\frac{92}{45}
\]

This equation is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. Instead, let's use the fact that \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic. The power of a point theorem states that for two chords \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at a point \(E\) inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one chord are equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. That is:
\[
AE \cdot EC = BE \cdot ED
\]

However, we need to find the length of \(CE\) directly. Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that \(E\) lies on the line \(DC\). The length of \(CE\) can be found using the distance formula between points \(C\) and \(E\).

Given that \(E\) is on the line \(DC\), we can use the fact that the coordinates of \(E\) can be found by solving the equation of the line \(DC\). The equation of the line \(DC\) is:
\[
y = \frac{16}{107}x
\]

Since \(E\) is on this line, we can use the fact that \(E\) is also on the line \(EF\). The equation of the line \(EF\) is:
\[
y = -\frac{92}{45}(x - 107)
\]

Setting the equations equal to each other to find the coordinates of \(E\):
\[
\frac{16}{107}x = -\frac{92}{45}(x - 107)
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
\frac{16}{107}x = -\frac{92}{45}x + \frac{92}{45} \cdot 107
\]
\[
\frac{16}{107}x + \frac{92}{45}x = \frac{92 \cdot 107}{45}
\]
\[
\left(\frac{16 \cdot 45 + 92 \cdot 107}{107 \cdot 45}\right)x = \frac{92 \cdot 107}{45}
\]
\[
\left(\frac{720 + 9844}{4815}\right)x = \frac{92 \cdot 107}{45}
\]
\[
\left(\frac{10564}{4815}\right)x = \frac{92 \cdot 107}{45}
\]
\[
x = \frac{92 \cdot 107 \cdot 4815}{45 \cdot 10564}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
x = \frac{92 \cdot 107 \cdot 4815}{45 \cdot 10564} = \frac{92 \cdot 107 \cdot 4815}{45 \cdot 10564} = \frac{92 \cdot 107 \cdot 4815}{45 \cdot 10564} = 107
\]

Since \(x = 107\), the coordinates of \(E\) are:
\[
E = \left(107, \frac{16}{107} \cdot 107\right) = (107, 16)
\]

The length of \(CE\) is:
\[
CE = \sqrt{(107 - 107)^2 + (16 - 16)^2} = 0
\]

However, this is not possible since \(E\) is not on the line \(DC\). Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the fact that \(E\) is the intersection of the line \(DC\) and the line \(EF\). The correct length of \(CE\) is:

To have exactly four direction changes, we need to have exactly four points where the path changes direction. This means that the path can be divided into five segments, where each segment is either all R or all U, and the segments alternate between R and U.

The number of ways to arrange these segments is the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 7 possible positions for the direction changes (since the first segment does not have a direction change before it). This is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 7, which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{4}\).

However, we also need to consider the order of the segments. Each segment can be either all R or all U, and there are 5 segments in total. The number of ways to arrange these segments is the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 7 for the direction changes, which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{4}\).

Therefore, the total number of paths is given by:
\[
\binom{7}{4} = 35
\]

Thus, the number of paths of length 16 that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and that change direction exactly four times, is \(\boxed{35}\).","[35, '35']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta)
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this simplifies to:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(468\cos\theta + 300\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
\]

Combining the real and imaginary parts, we have:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(468\cos\theta + 336\sin\theta)

The real part of this expression is:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta

To maximize this real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). The maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so the maximum value is:

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information about the circles and the triangle \(ABC\).

1. **Understanding the Configuration:**
   - There are 2024 circles with radius 1, each tangent to the sides \(AB\), \(BC\), and the incircle of triangle \(ABC\).
   - The incircle of triangle \(ABC\) has a radius of 34.

2. **Using the Descartes Circle Theorem:**
   The Descartes Circle Theorem relates the curvatures (reciprocals of the radii) of four mutually tangent circles. For three circles with curvatures \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) that are tangent to a fourth circle with curvature \(k_4\), the theorem states:
   \[
   (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4)^2 = 2(k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2)
   \]
   Here, the curvatures of the three circles with radius 1 are \(k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = 1\), and the curvature of the incircle is \(k_4 = \frac{1}{34}\). Let \(k_5\) be the curvature of the fourth circle (the circle with radius \(r\)). Applying the theorem, we get:
   \[
   (1 + 1 + 1 + k_5)^2 = 2(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + k_5^2)
   \]
   Simplifying, we have:
   \[
   (3 + k_5)^2 = 2(3 + k_5^2)
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying further:
   \[
   9 + 6k_5 + k_5^2 = 6 + 2k_5^2
   \]
   \[
   3 + 6k_5 = k_5^2
   \]
   \[
   k_5^2 - 6k_5 - 3 = 0
   \]
   Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(k_5 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = -3\):
   \[
   k_5 = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 12}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{48}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{3}
   \]
   Since \(k_5\) must be positive, we take:
   \[
   k_5 = 3 + 2\sqrt{3}
   \]
   The radius \(r\) of the circle is the reciprocal of the curvature:
   \[
   r = \frac{1}{k_5} = \frac{1}{3 + 2\sqrt{3}}
   \]
   Rationalizing the denominator:
   \[
   r = \frac{1}{3 + 2\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{3}}{3 - 2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{3}}{9 - 12} = \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{3}}{-3} = -1 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}
   \]
   However, this result does not match the expected form of the radius. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

3. **Revisiting the Problem:**
   The problem states that 2024 circles with radius 1 can be arranged in a similar manner. This implies that the radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) is related to the radius of the smaller circles. The correct approach is to use the fact that the radius of the incircle of a triangle is related to the inradius of the smaller circles.

4. **Using the Correct Relationship:**
   The radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) is 34, and the radius of the smaller circles is 1. The relationship between the inradius of the triangle and the radius of the smaller circles is given by:
   \[
   \text{Inradius of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2024} \times \text{Inradius of the smaller circles}
   \]
   Therefore, the inradius of the triangle is:
   \[
   \text{Inradius of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2024} \times 1 = \frac{1}{2024}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The inradius of the triangle is \(\frac{1}{2024}\), which is already in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 1\) and \(n = 2024\). The sum \(m + n\) is:
   \[
   m + n = 1 + 2024 = 2025

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a rectangle \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

First, let's consider the points \(A\) and \(C\) on the hyperbola. Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle and the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points \(B\) and \(D\) will be the reflections of \(A\) and \(C\) across the origin, respectively. Therefore, if \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), then \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\) and \(B = (-x_1, y_1)\), \(D = (x_1, -y_1)\).

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x_1 - (-x_1))^2 + (-y_1 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(2x_1)^2 + (-2y_1)^2} = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}
\]
Thus, the square of the length of \(BD\) is:
\[
BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)
\]

Since \(A = (x_1, y_1)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]
We can express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):
\[
y_1^2 = 24\left(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_1^2 + \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{5x_1^2 + 6x_1^2}{5} - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11x_1^2}{5} - 24\right) = \frac{44x_1^2}{5} - 96
\]

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to determine the maximum value of \(\frac{44x_1^2}{5} - 96\). Since \(x_1^2\) must be non-negative and satisfy the hyperbola equation, we need to find the range of \(x_1^2\). From the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} \geq 1 \implies x_1^2 \geq 20
\]

The expression \(\frac{44x_1^2}{5} - 96\) is a linear function of \(x_1^2\) and it increases as \(x_1^2\) increases. Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) occurs as \(x_1^2\) approaches infinity. However, we are asked to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for all such rectangles, which is the value when \(x_1^2\) is at its minimum, which is 20.

Substituting \(x_1^2 = 20\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44 \cdot 20}{5} - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80

Thus, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for all such rectangles is:

"To determine the number of indbyggere in Aimeville who eat all four of the specified things (a diamantring, a saet golfkøller, a havespade, and a pose with hjerteformede), we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of indbyggere who eat a diamantring.
- Let \( B \) be the set of indbyggere who eat a saet golfkøller.
- Let \( C \) be the set of indbyggere who eat a havespade.
- Let \( D \) be the set of indbyggere who eat a pose with hjerteformede.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of indbyggere is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of indbyggere who eat a diamantring is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of indbyggere who eat a saet golfkøller is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of indbyggere who eat a havespade is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of indbyggere who eat a pose with hjerteformede is \( |D| = 437 \).
- The number of indbyggere who eat exactly two of these things is 437.
- The number of indbyggere who eat exactly three of these things is 234.

We need to find the number of indbyggere who eat all four things, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

First, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Since every indbyggere eats at least one of these things, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

We know that the number of indbyggere who eat exactly two of these things is 437. This can be expressed as:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437
\]

We also know that the number of indbyggere who eat exactly three of these things is 234. This can be expressed as:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234
\]

Let \( x = |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \). Then we have:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 3x + 437
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 4x + 234
\]

Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion equation, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - (3x + 437) + (4x + 234) - x
\]
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - 3x - 437 + 4x + 234 - x
\]
\[
900 = 1383 - 2x
\]
\[
2x = 1383 - 900
\]
\[
2x = 483
\]
\[
x = 241.5

Since the number of indbyggere must be a whole number, we conclude that there is an error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the given data and the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the closest integer solution is:

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the triangle \( OAI \) is a right triangle with \( OI \) as one of the legs. The hypotenuse \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( IA \):
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The distance \( IA \) is the distance from the incenter \( I \) to the side \( BC \), which is equal to the inradius \( r \). Therefore, we have:
\[
r = 2\sqrt{39} = 6
\]
This step seems incorrect because it does not match the given inradius. Let's re-evaluate the problem using another approach.

The correct approach is to use the formula for the product of the sides of a triangle in terms of the circumradius \( R \), the inradius \( r \), and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{R^2 r^2}{R - r}
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{13^2 \cdot 6^2}{13 - 6} = \frac{169 \cdot 36}{7} = \frac{6084}{7}

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We can simplify this to:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Next, we need to find non-negative integer solutions to this equation. Let's consider the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be such that their sum is 300. We will test some possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to see if they satisfy the equation \(100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\).

First, let's try \(a = 200\). Then \(b + c = 100\). Substituting \(a = 200\) into the equation, we get:

\[
100(200b + 200c + bc) - 200bc = 2,000,000.
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
100(200(b + c) + bc) - 200bc = 2,000,000,
\]
\[
100(200 \cdot 100 + bc) - 200bc = 2,000,000,
\]
\[
100(20,000 + bc) - 200bc = 2,000,000,

\[
2,000,000 + 100bc - 200bc = 2,000,000,

\[
2,000,000 - 100bc = 2,000,000,
\]
\[
-100bc = 0,
\]
\[
bc = 0.
\]

Since \(b\) and \(c\) are non-negative integers and their product is 0, either \(b = 0\) or \(c = 0\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 100\), and if \(c = 0\), then \(b = 100\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), \((0, 200, 100)\), \((0, 100, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((100, 0, 200)\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not lie on any segment in the family \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments of unit length that lie in the first quadrant with one endpoint on the \(x\)-axis and the other on the \(y\)-axis.

First, let's determine the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \((0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). The slope of the line passing through \(A\) and \(B\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\), \(x_1 = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(y_1 = 0\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on this line such that the distance from \(O\) to \(C\) is minimized, except for the segment \(\overline{AB}\). The distance from the origin \(O = (0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the line is given by:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}}
\]
To minimize \(OC\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \(4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}\). The minimum value of a quadratic function \(ax^2 + bx + c\) occurs at \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\). Here, \(a = 4\), \(b = -3\), and \(c = \frac{3}{4}\), so:
\[
x = -\frac{-3}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into the equation of the line, we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

Now, we calculate the distance \(OC\):
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{12}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{16}\). In the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime, we have \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\). Thus, \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).
\]

The 13th roots of unity, excluding 1, are the roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\). Therefore, \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) are the 13th roots of unity, and they satisfy \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

We need to find the value of the product:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

First, we note that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). Therefore, the product can be rewritten as:

\[

We can factor out a 2 from the first term:

\[
2 \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2}).

However, a more straightforward approach is to consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of this polynomial are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to evaluate the product:

\]

This is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\), common ratio \(r = 2\), and 13 terms. The sum of a geometric series is given by:

\[
S = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} = \frac{1(2^{13} - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^{13} - 1 = 8191.
\]

Therefore, the value of the product is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 8191.
\]

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 8191 is divided by 1000. We do this by performing the division:

\[
8191 \div 1000 = 8 \text{ remainder } 191.
\]

Thus, the remainder is:

"To find the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than 20 \( b \)-beautiful integers, we need to understand the definition of a \( b \)-beautiful integer. A \( b \)-beautiful integer \( n \) has exactly \( k \) digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's determine the range of \( n \) for a given \( b \) and \( k \). If \( n \) has \( k \) digits in base \( b \), then:
\[ b^{k-1} \le n < b^k. \]
Additionally, the sum of the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) is at most \( k(b-1) \), so:
\[ k(b-1) = \sqrt{n} < \sqrt{b^k}. \]
This gives us the inequality:
\[ k(b-1) < b^{k/2}. \]

We need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than 20 \( b \)-beautiful integers. Let's test values of \( b \) starting from 2.

### For \( b = 2 \):

"To find the number of rectangles that can be inscribed in a regular dodecagon such that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the geometric properties of the dodecagon and the rectangles.

A regular dodecagon has 12 sides and 12 vertices. A rectangle inscribed in the dodecagon must have its sides parallel to the sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. This means that the vertices of the rectangle must be chosen such that they form a parallelogram with sides parallel to the sides of the dodecagon.

To form such a rectangle, we need to choose 4 vertices of the dodecagon such that the vertices are equally spaced around the dodecagon. This is because the sides of the rectangle must be parallel to the sides of the dodecagon, and the diagonals of the dodecagon that form the sides of the rectangle must also be equally spaced.

The number of ways to choose 4 vertices from 12 vertices such that they are equally spaced is given by the number of ways to choose a starting vertex and then choose every third vertex. This is equivalent to choosing a starting vertex and then choosing the next three vertices, which is the same as choosing a starting vertex and then choosing the next three vertices in a clockwise direction.

Since there are 12 vertices, there are 12 ways to choose a starting vertex. Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be inscribed in the dodecagon is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the squares of all elements in a list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Sum of the elements:**
   The sum of the elements in the list is 30.

2. **Unique type:**
   The unique type of the list is 9. This means that 9 is the only number that appears exactly once in the list.

3. **Median:**
   The median of the list is a positive integer that is not in the list. Since the median is the middle number in a sorted list, it must be an integer.

Let's denote the list by \( L = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n \). The median of the list is \( a_{\lceil n/2 \rceil} \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the number of elements:**
   Since the median is a positive integer and it is not in the list, the list must have an odd number of elements. Let \( n = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). The median is \( a_{k+1} \).

2. **Sum of the elements:**
   The sum of the elements is 30:
   \[
   a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{2k+1} = 30
   \]

3. **Unique type:**
   The number 9 appears exactly once in the list. Let's assume \( a_{k+1} = 9 \). Then the list can be written as:
   \[
   a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, 9, a_{k+2}, \ldots, a_{2k+1}
   \]
   where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_k < 9 \) and \( 9 < a_{k+2} \leq a_{k+3} \leq \cdots \leq a_{2k+1} \).

4. **Sum of the elements excluding the median:**
   The sum of the elements excluding the median is:
   \[
   a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k + a_{k+2} + \cdots + a_{2k+1} = 30 - 9 = 21
   \]

5. **Determine the elements:**
   Since 9 is the unique type, the elements \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k \) and \( a_{k+2}, \ldots, a_{2k+1} \) must be positive integers less than 9 and greater than 9, respectively. The possible values for \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k \) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The possible values for \( a_{k+2}, \ldots, a_{2k+1} \) are 10, 11, 12, \ldots.

6. **Find a valid combination:**
   Let's try to find a combination that satisfies the sum condition. If \( k = 3 \), then \( n = 7 \). The list is:
   \[
   a_1, a_2, a_3, 9, a_5, a_6, a_7
   \]
   where \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) are positive integers less than 9 and \( 9 < a_5 \leq a_6 \leq a_7 \). The sum of the elements is:
   \[
   a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 9 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 30
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 21
   \]
   One possible combination is \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), \( a_5 = 10 \), \( a_6 = 10 \), and \( a_7 = 10 \). This satisfies all the conditions.

7. **Calculate the sum of the squares:**
   The sum of the squares of the elements is:
   \[
   1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 81 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 395

Therefore, the sum of the squares of all elements in the list is \(\boxed{395}\).","[395, '395']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to place digits in a \(2 \times 3\) grid such that the sum of the numbers read from left to right is 999 and the sum of the numbers read from top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The number read from left to right is \(100a + 10b + c\) and the number read from top to bottom is \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(100a + 10b + c = 999 - (100d + 10e + f)\)

From the first equation, we can simplify to:

\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]

Since \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) are digits (0-9), the sum \(a + d\) must be 9, \(b + e\) must be 9, and \(c + f\) must be 9. This is because the maximum sum of two digits is 18, and the only way to get a sum of 999 when adding three such sums is if each sum is 999/3 = 333.

Now, we need to find digits \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) such that:

\[
a + d = 9, \quad b + e = 9, \quad c + f = 9
\]

And the number read from left to right is 999:

\[
100a + 10b + c = 999
\]

From this, we can see that \(a = 9\), \(b = 9\), and \(c = 9\). Substituting these values into the equations for \(d, e, f\), we get:

\[
d = 0, \quad e = 0, \quad f = 0
\]

Thus, the grid is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
9 & 9 & 9 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline

We can verify that this grid satisfies both conditions:

1. The sum of the numbers read from left to right is \(999 + 0 = 999\).
2. The sum of the numbers read from top to bottom is \(999 + 0 = 999\).

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Since \(1 = 2^0\), we equate the exponents:

\[
0 = \frac{13}{12}
\]

This equation is not possible, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. However, we can still find the value of \(x^4 y^3 z^2\) by using the original equations. From the equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

We substitute \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
y = (yz \sqrt{2}) z 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 2^{\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 2^{\frac{5}{6}}
\]

Since \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[
1 = z^2 2^{\frac{5}{6}}
\]
\[
z^2 = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]
\[
z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

Next, we substitute \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) into \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\):

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12} + \frac{6}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Finally, we substitute \(x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\) and \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
y = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}) \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12} - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{1}{3}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12} - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{4}{12}} = y \cdot 2^0 = y
\]

This equation is consistent, so we can find \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}})^4 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12}} = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
y^3 = y^3
\]
\[
z^2 = (2^{-\frac{5}{12}})^2 = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]

Therefore,

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot y^3 \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} = y^7 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = y^7 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Since \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}) \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{3}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{5}{12}}\), we substitute \(y = 2^{\frac{5}{12}}\) into the equation:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (2^{\frac{5}{12}})^7 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2^{\frac{35}{12}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2^{\frac{35}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{-1} = 2^{\frac{35}{12} + \frac{6}{12} - \frac{12}{12}} = 2^{\frac{29}{12}}

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is:

\[
\left|\log_2(2^{\frac{29}{12}})\right| = \frac{29}{12}

\[200 + 240 + 300 = 740.\]

Since the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides is equal, the total perimeter of the hexagon is:
\[2 \times 740 = 1480.\]

The perimeter of the hexagon is also the sum of the lengths of all its sides:
\[AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 200 + b + 240 + d + 300 + f = 740 + b + d.\]

Since \(b + d = 500\), we substitute this into the perimeter equation:
\[740 + 500 = 1240.\]

Therefore, the length of each side of the hexagon is:
\[\boxed{200, 240, 300, 200, 240, 300}.\]","[{200, 240, 300}, '200, 240, 300, 200, 240, 300']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the conditions given for the sets \( A \) and \( B \). Alice's set \( A \) is a set of positive integers, and Bob's set \( B \) is a set of positive integers such that the maximum element in \( B \) is an element of \( A \). Bob's list contains 2024 such sets \( B \).

First, let's consider the possible sets \( B \) for a given maximum element \( a \in A \). The set \( B \) can include any subset of the positive integers less than \( a \). If \( a \) is the maximum element of \( B \), then \( B \) can be any subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a-1\} \). The number of subsets of a set with \( a-1 \) elements is \( 2^{a-1} \). Therefore, for each \( a \in A \), there are \( 2^{a-1} \) possible sets \( B \).

Since Bob's list contains 2024 sets \( B \), we need to find the sum of the elements in \( A \) such that the sum of the number of subsets for all elements in \( A \) is 2024. This means we need to find \( A \) such that:
\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
\]

We can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as:
\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1
\]
where \( n \) is the number of elements in \( A \). Therefore, we need to solve:
\[
2^n - 1 = 2024
\]
Adding 1 to both sides, we get:
\[
2^n = 2025
\]
Taking the base-2 logarithm of both sides, we get:
\[
n = \log_2 2025
\]
Since \( 2^{10} = 1024 \) and \( 2^{11} = 2048 \), we see that \( n = 11 \). Therefore, \( A \) must contain 11 elements.

The elements of \( A \) are the first 11 positive integers, i.e., \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \). The sum of the elements in \( A \) is:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = \frac{11(11+1)}{2} = 66
\]

Thus, the sum of the elements in \( A \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that when any of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote the four-digit number \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits.

First, we need to check the divisibility of the numbers formed by changing each digit to 1:
- The number \( 1bcd \) should be divisible by 7.
- The number \( a1cd \) should be divisible by 7.
- The number \( ab1d \) should be divisible by 7.
- The number \( abc1 \) should be divisible by 7.

We can express these numbers in terms of \( N \):
- \( 1bcd = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = N + 999 \)
- \( a1cd = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = N + 990 \)
- \( ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d = N + 990 \)
- \( abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = N + 999 \)

Since \( N + 999 \) and \( N + 990 \) must both be divisible by 7, we can find the difference between them:
\[ (N + 999) - (N + 990) = 9 \]
So, \( N + 990 \) must be divisible by 7. Therefore, \( N \) must be of the form \( 7k - 990 \) for some integer \( k \).

Next, we need to find the largest four-digit number of this form. The largest four-digit number is 9999, so we solve:
\[ 7k - 990 \leq 9999 \]
\[ 7k \leq 10989 \]
\[ k \leq 1569.8571 \]
The largest integer \( k \) is 1569. Therefore, the largest possible value of \( N \) is:
\[ N = 7 \cdot 1569 - 990 = 10983 - 990 = 9993 \]

Now, we need to verify that \( N = 9993 \) satisfies the original condition. We check the numbers formed by changing each digit to 1:
- \( 1993 = 1000 + 993 = 1993 \) (divisible by 7)
- \( 9193 = 9000 + 193 = 9193 \) (divisible by 7)
- \( 9913 = 9000 + 913 = 9913 \) (divisible by 7)
- \( 9991 = 9000 + 991 = 9991 \) (divisible by 7)

Since all these numbers are divisible by 7, \( N = 9993 \) is indeed the largest four-digit number that satisfies the condition.

Next, we need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when \( N = 9993 \) is divided by 1000. We have:
\[ 9993 \div 1000 = 9 \text{ remainder } 993 \]
So, \( Q = 9 \) and \( R = 993 \).

Finally, we find \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 9 + 993 = 1002 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles of tangency of the torus \( T \) with the sphere \( S \) when the torus is viewed from the outside and inside, respectively. The difference \( r_i - r_o \) will then be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) in simplest form, and we need to find \( m + n \).

First, let's define the parameters of the torus and the sphere:
- The radius of the torus's circular cross-section is \( R = 3 \).
- The distance from the center of the torus's circular cross-section to the center of the torus (the major radius) is \( a = 6 \).
- The radius of the sphere is \( R_s = 11 \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( r_i \)
When the torus is viewed from the outside, the circle of tangency is the innermost circle of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( a = 6 \), and the radius of the torus's circular cross-section is \( R = 3 \). The radius \( r_i \) of the inner circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
r_i = \sqrt{R_s^2 - (a + R)^2} = \sqrt{11^2 - (6 + 3)^2} = \sqrt{121 - 81} = \sqrt{40} = 2\sqrt{10}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( r_o \)
When the torus is viewed from the inside, the circle of tangency is the outermost circle of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( a = 6 \), and the radius of the torus's circular cross-section is \( R = 3 \). The radius \( r_o \) of the outer circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
r_o = \sqrt{R_s^2 - (a - R)^2} = \sqrt{11^2 - (6 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{121 - 9} = \sqrt{112} = 4\sqrt{7}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( r_i - r_o \)
Now, we find the difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \):
\[
r_i - r_o = 2\sqrt{10} - 4\sqrt{7}
\]

### Step 4: Express \( r_i - r_o \) as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \)
To express \( 2\sqrt{10} - 4\sqrt{7} \) as a fraction, we need to rationalize the expression. However, since \( \sqrt{10} \) and \( \sqrt{7} \) are irrational and do not have a common factor, the expression is already in its simplest form. Therefore, we can write:
\[
r_i - r_o = \frac{2\sqrt{10} - 4\sqrt{7}}{1}
\]

### Step 5: Find \( m + n \)
In the fraction \( \frac{2\sqrt{10} - 4\sqrt{7}}{1} \), \( m = 2\sqrt{10} - 4\sqrt{7} \) and \( n = 1 \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are not integers, we need to consider the problem in a different context. The problem likely implies that the difference \( r_i - r_o \) is a rational number, which is not the case here. However, if we assume the problem is asking for the sum of the coefficients of the rationalized form, we can consider the coefficients of the terms involving \( \sqrt{10} \) and \( \sqrt{7} \).

The sum of the coefficients is:
\[
2 + (-4) = -2
\]

Since the problem asks for \( m + n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the sum of the coefficients of the rationalized form, which is:
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to place 25 red chips and 25 blue chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip of each color, and no additional chip can be placed without violating this condition. This means that the chips must be placed in a way that they form a permutation of rows and columns for both colors.

First, let's consider the placement of the red chips. There are \(5!\) (5 factorial) ways to arrange 5 red chips in the grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one red chip. This is because we are essentially permuting the rows and columns independently.

Once the red chips are placed, the placement of the blue chips is uniquely determined. Each row and each column that does not contain a red chip must contain exactly one blue chip. Therefore, there is only one way to place the blue chips once the red chips are fixed.

Thus, the total number of ways to place the chips is simply the number of ways to arrange the red chips, which is \(5!\).

Calculating \(5!\), we get:
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",902,"[902, '902']",False
