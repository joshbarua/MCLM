"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time the woman spends traveling and the time she spends at the hotel in each scenario, and then use these to find the speed \( s \) and the time \( t \) spent at the hotel. Finally, we will calculate the total time spent traveling if she travels at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( d \) is the distance traveled by the woman before reaching the hotel.
- \( t \) is the time spent at the hotel in hours.
- \( s \) is the speed in kilometers per hour.

### Step 1: Set up the equations for the two scenarios

**Scenario 1:**
- Speed: \( s \) km/h
- Time traveling: \( \frac{d}{s} \) hours
- Time at the hotel: \( t \) hours
- Total time: \( \frac{d}{s} + t = 4 \) hours

**Scenario 2:**
- Speed: \( s + 2 \) km/h
- Time traveling: \( \frac{d}{s+2} \) hours
- Time at the hotel: \( t \) hours
- Total time: \( \frac{d}{s+2} + t = 4.4 \) hours (since 2 hours and 24 minutes is 4.4 hours)

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

We have two equations:
1. \( \frac{d}{s} + t = 4 \)
2. \( \frac{d}{s+2} + t = 4.4 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ \frac{d}{s+2} - \frac{d}{s} = 0.4 \]

Find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[ \frac{ds - d(s+2)}{s(s+2)} = 0.4 \]
\[ \frac{ds - ds - 2d}{s(s+2)} = 0.4 \]
\[ \frac{-2d}{s(s+2)} = 0.4 \]
\[ -2d = 0.4s(s+2) \]
\[ -2d = 0.4s^2 + 0.8s \]
\[ d = -0.2s^2 - 0.4s \]

Substitute \( d \) back into the first equation:
\[ \frac{-0.2s^2 - 0.4s}{s} + t = 4 \]
\[ -0.2s - 0.4 + t = 4 \]
\[ t = 4.4 + 0.2s \]

### Step 3: Substitute \( t \) into the second equation to verify

Substitute \( t = 4.4 + 0.2s \) into the second equation:
\[ \frac{-0.2s^2 - 0.4s}{s+2} + 4.4 + 0.2s = 4.4 \]
\[ \frac{-0.2s^2 - 0.4s}{s+2} + 0.2s = 0 \]
\[ \frac{-0.2s(s+2)}{s+2} + 0.2s = 0 \]
\[ -0.2s + 0.2s = 0 \]

This confirms that our expressions for \( d \) and \( t \) are correct.

### Step 4: Find the speed \( s \)

We have:
\[ t = 4.4 + 0.2s \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total time spent traveling if she travels at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h

The distance \( d \) is:
\[ d = -0.2s^2 - 0.4s \]

The time traveling is:
\[ \frac{d}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{-0.2s^2 - 0.4s}{s + \frac{1}{2}} \]

The total time is:
\[ \frac{-0.2s^2 - 0.4s}{s + \frac{1}{2}} + t \]

First, simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{-0.2s^2 - 0.4s}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{-0.2s(s + 2)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} \]

Now, substitute \( t = 4.4 + 0.2s \):
\[ \frac{-0.2s(s + 2)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} + 4.4 + 0.2s \]

To find the exact value, we need to solve for \( s \) using the quadratic equation derived from the first equation. However, we can use the fact that the total time is a linear function of \( s \) and \( t \) to find the total time when \( s = s + \frac{1}{2} \).

The total time is:
\[ \frac{-0.2s^2 - 0.4s}{s + \frac{1}{2}} + 4.4 + 0.2s \]

After solving, we find that the total time is:
\[ \boxed{4.6} \] hours.","[4.60000000000000, '4.6']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), we will use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

First, we note that \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral because \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to the circle at \(B\) and \(C\). The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \(A\) outside a circle and a line through \(A\) intersecting the circle at points \(B\) and \(C\), the power of the point \(A\) with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the chord through \(A\). In this case, the power of point \(A\) is also equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(A\) to the circle.

The Power of a Point theorem gives us:
\[
AD^2 = AB \cdot AC
\]
Given \(AB = 5\), \(AC = 10\), we can substitute these values into the equation:
\[
AD^2 = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
\]
Thus,
\[
AD = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(P\) is the other intersection of \(AD\) with the circle. By the Power of a Point theorem again, the power of point \(A\) with respect to the circle is also equal to \(AP \cdot AD\). Since we already know \(AD^2 = 50\), we have:
\[
AP \cdot AD = AD^2
\]
Substituting \(AD = 5\sqrt{2}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
AP \cdot 5\sqrt{2} = 50
\]
Solving for \(AP\), we divide both sides by \(5\sqrt{2}\):
\[
AP = \frac{50}{5\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

However, we need to express \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers. Since \(5\sqrt{2}\) is not in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that \(AP\) is the length of the segment from \(A\) to the point where the tangent at \(A\) intersects the circle again, which is the same as the length of the tangent from \(A\) to the circle. Therefore, the correct value of \(AP\) is:
\[
AP = \frac{50}{5\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the correct value of \(AP\) is:
\[
AP = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that after a random rotation of a regular hexagon with vertices colored either red or blue, all blue vertices end up in positions where the original red vertices were. Let's denote the vertices of the hexagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6 \) in a clockwise order.

First, we note that there are \( 2^6 = 64 \) possible colorings of the hexagon since each vertex can be either red or blue. We are interested in the colorings where the blue vertices end up in the positions of the red vertices after a random rotation. This means that the coloring must be a palindrome, i.e., \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) must be the same color, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) must be the same color, and \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) must be the same color.

There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible palindromic colorings of the hexagon. These are:
1. All vertices are red.
2. All vertices are blue.
3. \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) are red, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) are red, \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) are red.
4. \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) are red, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) are red, \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) are blue.
5. \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) are red, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) are blue, \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) are red.
6. \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) are red, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) are blue, \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) are blue.
7. \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) are blue, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) are red, \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) are red.
8. \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) are blue, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) are red, \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) are blue.
9. \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) are blue, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) are blue, \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) are red.
10. \( A_1 \) and \( A_4 \) are blue, \( A_2 \) and \( A_5 \) are blue, \( A_3 \) and \( A_6 \) are blue.

However, only the first three colorings are distinct in terms of the positions of the red and blue vertices. Therefore, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) distinct palindromic colorings.

The probability that a randomly chosen coloring is a palindrome is:
\[
\frac{8}{64} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Thus, the probability that all blue vertices end up in positions where the original red vertices were is \(\frac{1}{8}\). Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 8 \), and \( m + n = 1 + 8 = 9 \).

"To find the number of points of intersection of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f \) and \( g \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions \( f \) and \( g \):
\[ f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \]

Next, we need to find the compositions \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \):
\[ f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, we can find the compositions \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
\[ g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \left( |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{4} = |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \left( |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{4} = |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{3}{4} \]

The equations of the graphs become:
\[ y = 4 \left( |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{3}{4} \right) = 4 |\sin(2 \pi x)| - 3 \]
\[ x = 4 \left( |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{3}{4} \right) = 4 |\cos(3 \pi y)| - 3 \]

To find the points of intersection, we set \( y = x \):
\[ 4 |\sin(2 \pi x)| - 3 = 4 |\cos(3 \pi x)| - 3 \]
\[ 4 |\sin(2 \pi x)| = 4 |\cos(3 \pi x)| \]
\[ |\sin(2 \pi x)| = |\cos(3 \pi x)| \]

We need to solve the equation \( |\sin(2 \pi x)| = |\cos(3 \pi x)| \). The function \( |\sin(2 \pi x)| \) is periodic with period \( \frac{1}{2} \) and the function \( |\cos(3 \pi x)| \) is periodic with period \( \frac{2}{3} \). The least common multiple of \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{2}{3} \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \), so we will consider the interval \( [0, \frac{2}{3}] \).

We need to find the points where \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \cos(3 \pi x) \) or \( \sin(2 \pi x) = -\cos(3 \pi x) \).

1. \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \cos(3 \pi x) \)
   - \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \cos(3 \pi x) \) when \( 2 \pi x = \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi x + 2k\pi \) or \( 2 \pi x = \frac{3\pi}{2} - 3 \pi x + 2k\pi \) for integer \( k \).
   - Solving \( 2 \pi x = \frac{\pi}{2} - 3 \pi x \) gives \( x = \frac{1}{10} \).
   - Solving \( 2 \pi x = \frac{3\pi}{2} - 3 \pi x \) gives \( x = \frac{3}{10} \).

2. \( \sin(2 \pi x) = -\cos(3 \pi x) \)
   - \( \sin(2 \pi x) = -\cos(3 \pi x) \) when \( 2 \pi x = \frac{3\pi}{2} - 3 \pi x + 2k\pi \) or \( 2 \pi x = \frac{5\pi}{2} - 3 \pi x + 2k\pi \) for integer \( k \).
   - Solving \( 2 \pi x = \frac{3\pi}{2} - 3 \pi x \) gives \( x = \frac{3}{10} \).
   - Solving \( 2 \pi x = \frac{5\pi}{2} - 3 \pi x \) gives \( x = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \).

So, the solutions in the interval \( [0, \frac{2}{3}] \) are \( x = \frac{1}{10}, \frac{3}{10}, \frac{1}{2} \).

Since the functions are periodic, we need to consider the interval \( [0, 1] \). The solutions in this interval are \( x = \frac{1}{10}, \frac{3}{10}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{7}{10}, \frac{9}{10}, \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, the number of points of intersection is \( \boxed{6} \).","[6, '6']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, it is more useful to consider the factorization over the integers modulo a prime \( p \).

We need to find the smallest prime \( p \) for which there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \), so the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be 8. Therefore, 8 must divide \( p^2 - 1 \), or equivalently, \( p^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). The smallest prime \( p \) that satisfies this condition is \( p = 3 \).

Now, we need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 3^2 = 9 \). We can test the values \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \) modulo 9:

\[
8^4 + 1 = 4097 \equiv 4 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}.

Since none of these values are congruent to 0 modulo 9, there is no integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to consider the next prime \( p = 5 \).

We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \). We can test the values \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \) modulo 25:

Since none of these values are congruent to 0 modulo 25, there is no integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 25. Therefore, we need to consider the next prime \( p = 17 \).

We need to check if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We can test the values \( n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 16 \) modulo 289:

Since \( 12^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \), there exists an integer \( n = 12 \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 289.

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information about the quadrilateral \(ABCD\). We know that \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). This configuration suggests that \(ABCD\) is a kite or a rhombus, but we need to confirm this by checking the diagonals.

First, we use the fact that the diagonals of a kite or a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Let's denote the diagonals as \(AC\) and \(BD\). Since \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the diagonals. Consider the right triangle \(AOB\) where \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals. Then \(AO = \frac{\sqrt{80}}{2} = 2\sqrt{5}\) and \(BO = \frac{\sqrt{80}}{2} = 2\sqrt{5}\). Let \(AB = \sqrt{41}\). Then in \(\triangle AOB\),
\[
AB^2 = AO^2 + BO^2 \implies 41 = (2\sqrt{5})^2 + (2\sqrt{5})^2 \implies 41 = 20 + 20 \implies 41 = 40.
\]
This is a contradiction, so \(ABCD\) cannot be a rhombus. However, it is still possible that \(ABCD\) is a kite.

For a kite, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, and the diagonals are perpendicular. Let's consider the right triangle \(BOC\) where \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals. Then \(BO = 2\sqrt{5}\) and \(CO = \frac{\sqrt{89}}{2}\). Let \(BC = \sqrt{89}\). Then in \(\triangle BOC\),
\[
BC^2 = BO^2 + CO^2 \implies 89 = (2\sqrt{5})^2 + CO^2 \implies 89 = 20 + CO^2 \implies CO^2 = 69 \implies CO = \sqrt{69}.
\]
This is consistent, so \(ABCD\) is indeed a kite.

The diagonals of a kite bisect each other at right angles, and the intersection point \(I\) is the circumcenter of the kite. The distance from the circumcenter to any vertex of the kite is the circumradius \(R\). For a kite with diagonals \(d_1\) and \(d_2\), the circumradius \(R\) is given by
\[
R = \frac{d_1 d_2}{2\sqrt{d_1^2 + d_2^2}}.
\]
Here, \(d_1 = \sqrt{80}\) and \(d_2 = \sqrt{89}\), so
\[
R = \frac{\sqrt{80} \cdot \sqrt{89}}{2\sqrt{(\sqrt{80})^2 + (\sqrt{89})^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{7120}}{2\sqrt{80 + 89}} = \frac{\sqrt{7120}}{2\sqrt{169}} = \frac{\sqrt{7120}}{2 \cdot 13} = \frac{\sqrt{7120}}{26} = \frac{4\sqrt{445}}{26} = \frac{2\sqrt{445}}{13}.
\]
Thus, the distance from \(I\) to any vertex is \(\frac{2\sqrt{445}}{13}\). Here, \(m = 2\), \(n = 445\), and \(p = 13\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 2 + 445 + 13 = 460\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain all the rectangular parallelepipeds in the set \(\mathcal{B}\), where each parallelepiped has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius \( r \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the farthest point on any of the parallelepipeds.

First, let's denote the dimensions of a rectangular parallelepiped by \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The volume and surface area of the parallelepiped are given by:
\[
abc = 23
\]
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \implies ab + bc + ca = 27
\]

The farthest point on the parallelepiped from its center is the point on the diagonal, which is given by:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

To find \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \), we use the identity:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We need to find \( a + b + c \). Let \( s = a + b + c \). Then:
\[
s^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54 \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s^2 - 54
\]

We also know that:
\[
abc = 23
\]
Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies \frac{s}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{23} \implies s \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23}
\]

To find a more precise value for \( s \), we can use the fact that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - st^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]

We can use numerical methods or trial and error to find approximate values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). However, for the purpose of finding the radius, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the roots of a polynomial can be found using symmetric sums. The exact values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are not necessary to find the radius of the sphere.

The radius \( r \) of the sphere is:
\[
r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

The value of \( r^2 \) is:
\[
r^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2
\]

Using the identity and the fact that \( s \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23} \), we can find that:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s^2 - 54
\]

The exact value of \( s \) can be found by solving the polynomial equation, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use the fact that the minimum value of \( s^2 \) is achieved when \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are as close to each other as possible. By trial and error or numerical methods, we find that the minimum value of \( s^2 \) is 54, which gives:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 54 - 54 = 0
\]

However, this is not possible since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive. Therefore, we need to find the next closest value, which is:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 54
\]

Thus, the radius \( r \) is:
\[
r = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}
\]

The value of \( r^2 \) is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(x^{\log_x(y)} = y\). Therefore, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), where \(\log\) is the natural logarithm. Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Next, we apply the property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Similarly, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10\)
2. \(\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10\)

To eliminate the fractions, we multiply the first equation by \(\log(x)\) and the second equation by \(\log(y)\):

1. \(x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)\)
2. \(4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)\)

Next, we solve for \(\log(y)\) in terms of \(\log(x)\) from the first equation:

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

We substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \cdot \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]

Solving for \(y\), we get:

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now we substitute \(y = \frac{25}{x}\) back into the expression for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log\left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Using the property of logarithms that states \(\log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log(a) - \log(b)\), we have:

\[
\log(25) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(25) = 2 \log(5)\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we multiply both sides by \(x\):

\[
2x \log(5) - x \log(x) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
2x \log(5) = x \log(x) + 10 \log(x)
\]

Factoring out \(\log(x)\) on the right side, we have:

\[
2x \log(5) = (x + 10) \log(x)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\), we get:

\[
2x \frac{\log(5)}{\log(x)} = x + 10
\]

Since \(\frac{\log(5)}{\log(x)} = \log_x(5)\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2x \log_x(5) = x + 10
\]

We know from the original problem that \(x \log_x(5) = 10\), so we substitute this into the equation:

\[
2 \cdot 10 = x + 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
20 = x + 10
\]

Solving for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = 10
\]

Now we substitute \(x = 10\) back into the expression for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{25}{10} = 2.5
\]

Finally, we find \(xy\):

\[
xy = 10 \cdot 2.5 = 25
\]

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the conditions under which Bob can always force a win.

First, let's define the game more clearly:
- There are \( n \) players.
- Each player can either take 1 or 4 players from the pool.
- The player who takes the last player wins.

We will use dynamic programming to determine the winning and losing positions. Let \( W(n) \) be a winning position and \( L(n) \) be a losing position. A position \( n \) is a winning position if there is at least one move that leads to a losing position. Conversely, a position \( n \) is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Base Cases:**
   - \( W(1) \): If there is only 1 player left, the current player wins. Therefore, \( W(1) \).
   - \( W(2) \): If there are 2 players left, the current player can take 1 player, leaving 1 player for the next player. The next player will then take the last player and win. Therefore, \( W(2) \).
   - \( W(3) \): If there are 3 players left, the current player can take 1 player, leaving 2 players for the next player. The next player will then take 1 player, leaving 1 player for the next player. The next player will then take the last player and win. Therefore, \( W(3) \).
   - \( W(4) \): If there are 4 players left, the current player can take 4 players, leaving 0 players for the next player. The next player will then take no players and lose. Therefore, \( W(4) \).

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - For \( n \geq 5 \):
     - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), the current player can take 4 players, leaving \( n-4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). The next player will then be in a losing position. Therefore, \( W(n) \).
     - If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), the current player can take 4 players, leaving \( n-4 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). The next player will then be in a losing position. Therefore, \( W(n) \).
     - If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), the current player can take 4 players, leaving \( n-4 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \). The next player will then be in a losing position. Therefore, \( W(n) \).
     - If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), the current player can take 1 player, leaving \( n-1 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \). The next player will then be in a winning position. Therefore, \( L(n) \).
     - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), the current player can take 1 player, leaving \( n-1 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \). The next player will then be in a winning position. Therefore, \( L(n) \).

From the above analysis, we see that the losing positions are \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) and \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).

### Counting the Number of Losing Positions

We need to count the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are losing positions. These are the integers \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).

- The number of integers \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).
- The number of integers \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024 - 4}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).

Therefore, the total number of losing positions is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

The number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \( 2024 - 809 = 1215 \).

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{1215}\).","[1215, '1215']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen set of 4 numbers from \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \) is a set where all four numbers are the same, given that it is a set where at least two of the numbers are the same.

First, let's determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from \( S \) such that at least two of the numbers are the same. This is the complement of the number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from \( S \).

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from \( S \) is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
\]

The number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from \( S \) is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from \( S \) such that at least two of the numbers are the same is:
\[
10^4 - 10 = 10000 - 10 = 9990
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from \( S \) such that all four numbers are the same. Since there are only 10 numbers in \( S \), there are exactly 10 ways to choose 4 numbers from \( S \) such that all four numbers are the same.

The probability that a randomly chosen set of 4 numbers from \( S \) is a set where all four numbers are the same, given that it is a set where at least two of the numbers are the same, is:
\[
\frac{10}{9990} = \frac{1}{999}
\]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{1}{999}\), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 999 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 999 = 1000 \).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the quadrilaterals \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) share certain points and lines.

First, note that since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic. Similarly, since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the quadrilateral \(DECF\) is a straight line segment.

- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

We need to find the length of \(CE\).

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are points on the line segment \(DF\). Therefore, \(CE\) is a part of the line segment \(DF\).

To find \(CE\), we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are also points on the circle circumscribing \(ADHG\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are points on the line segment \(DF\) and the given lengths.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of closed paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start and end at the same point, and change direction exactly four times. Each change of direction corresponds to a turn of 90 degrees, so a path that changes direction exactly four times must have exactly four turns.

We can represent each path as a sequence of moves, where each move is either up, down, left, or right. Since the path is closed and has exactly four turns, it must consist of two segments of moves in one direction and two segments of moves in the perpendicular direction. For example, a path could be ""up-up-right-right-down-down-left-left-down-down-up-up-right-right"".

The number of ways to arrange these segments is the number of ways to arrange two ""U"" (up), two ""D"" (down), two ""L"" (left), and two ""R"" (right) moves in a sequence of 8 moves. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:

"To find the part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) that is the largest real part when \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta)

The real part of this expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) given that there are 2024 circles with radius 1 that can be inscribed in a similar manner as described. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are 2024 circles with radius 1 inscribed in a similar manner as described.
   - The radius of the circumcircle of triangle \(ABC\) is 34.
   - Two of the inscribed circles have radii equal to the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) and the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\), respectively.

2. **Relating the Number of Inscribed Circles to the Inradius and Circumradius:**
   - The number of circles with radius 1 that can be inscribed in a similar manner is proportional to the difference between the circumradius and the inradius.
   - Specifically, the number of such circles is given by the formula:
     \[
     \frac{R - r}{1} = 2024
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     R - r = 2024
     \]

3. **Substituting the Given Circumradius:**
   - We know that the circumradius \(R\) is 34.
   - Substituting \(R = 34\) into the equation, we get:
     \[
     34 - r = 2024
     \]

4. **Solving for the Inradius:**
   - Solving for \(r\), we get:
     \[
     r = 34 - 2024 = -1990
     \]
   - However, this result is not possible because the inradius cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

5. **Revisiting the Problem:**
   - The problem states that there are 2024 circles with radius 1 inscribed in a similar manner, but the interpretation might be different.
   - The correct interpretation is that the number of such circles is proportional to the ratio of the circumradius to the inradius.
   - Specifically, the number of such circles is given by the formula:
     \[
     \frac{R}{r} = 2024
     \]

6. **Substituting the Given Circumradius:**
   - We know that the circumradius \(R\) is 34.
   - Substituting \(R = 34\) into the equation, we get:
     \[
     \frac{34}{r} = 2024

7. **Solving for the Inradius:**
   - Solving for \(r\), we get:
     \[
     r = \frac{34}{2024} = \frac{17}{1012}

8. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The fraction \(\frac{17}{1012}\) is already in its simplest form because 17 is a prime number and does not divide 1012.

9. **Finding \(m + n\):**

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The hyperbola has its center at the origin \((0,0)\), and its asymptotes are given by the equations \(y = \pm \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{5}} x\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle inscribed in the hyperbola with its diagonals intersecting at the origin, the vertices of the rectangle can be written as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\). These points satisfy the hyperbola equation, so we have:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1.
\]

The lengths of the sides of the rectangle are \(2x_1\) and \(2y_1\). The lengths of the diagonals \(BD\) and \(AC\) are both equal to \(2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\). The square of the length of the diagonal is:
\[
BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2).
\]

We need to express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\) using the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{y_1^2}{24} = \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1 \implies y_1^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24.
\]

Substituting \(y_1^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4 \left( x_1^2 + \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{11x_1^2}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{44x_1^2}{5} - 96.
\]

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to determine the maximum value of the quadratic function \(\frac{44x_1^2}{5} - 96\). Since the coefficient of \(x_1^2\) is positive, the function is an increasing function of \(x_1^2\). The maximum value of \(BD^2\) occurs as \(x_1^2\) approaches its maximum value, which is unbounded in theory, but in the context of the problem, we are looking for the maximum value that is finite and less than the value when \(x_1^2\) is at its maximum possible value within the hyperbola.

However, the problem asks for the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for any rectangle inscribed in the hyperbola, and we can see that the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is unbounded as \(x_1^2\) approaches infinity. Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:

"To determine the number of patients who have all four conditions (nephron, stent, stent, and stent), we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of patients with nephron.
- Let \( B \) be the set of patients with stent.
- Let \( C \) be the set of patients with stent.
- Let \( D \) be the set of patients with stent.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of patients is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of patients with nephron is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of patients with stent is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of patients with stent is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of patients with exactly two conditions is \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437 \).
- The number of patients with exactly three conditions is \( |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234 \).

We need to find the number of patients who have all four conditions, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

First, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Since the total number of patients is 900, we have:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900
\]

We can rewrite the inclusion-exclusion formula as:
\[
900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

We know that:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234
\]

Let \( x = |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \). Then:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 + 3x
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 + 4x
\]

Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get:
\[
900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (437 + 3x) + (234 + 4x) - x
\]
\[
900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - 203 + 0x
\]
\[
900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - 203
\]
\[
|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 1103
\]

Since \( |A| = 195 \), \( |B| = 367 \), and \( |C| = 562 \), we have:
\[
195 + 367 + 562 + |D| = 1103
\]
\[
1124 + |D| = 1103
\]
\[

"To solve for \( AB \cdot AC \) in the given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the specified conditions, we will use properties of the triangle's incenter \( I \) and circumcenter \( O \), as well as the given radii of the incircle and circumcircle.

Given:
- The circumradius \( R = 13 \)
- The inradius \( r = 6 \)
- \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \)

First, we use the relationship between the circumradius \( R \), the inradius \( r \), and the distance \( d \) between the incenter \( I \) and the circumcenter \( O \) of a triangle:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
d = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( I \) lies on the circle with center \( O \) and radius \( d \). Therefore, \( I \) is at a distance \( d = \sqrt{13} \) from \( O \).

Next, we use the fact that the distance from the incenter \( I \) to a side of the triangle is equal to the inradius \( r \). Let \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), and \( c = AB \). The area \( \Delta \) of \( \triangle ABC \) can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s
\]
where \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \).

The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]

Equating the two expressions for the area:
\[
r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Substituting \( r = 6 \) and \( R = 13 \):
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
\[
312s = abc
\]

Now, we use the fact that \( I \) is at a distance \( d = \sqrt{13} \) from \( O \). The distance \( d \) can also be expressed in terms of the sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) and the circumradius \( R \):
\[
d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \cos A \cos B \cos C
\]
Since \( d = \sqrt{13} \), \( R = 13 \), and \( r = 6 \):
\[
13 = 169 - 12 \cos A \cos B \cos C
\]
\[
12 \cos A \cos B \cos C = 156
\]
\[
\cos A \cos B \cos C = 13
\]

Using the identity for the product of the cosines in a triangle:
\[
\cos A \cos B \cos C = \frac{s^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{4R^2}
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \):
\[
13 = \frac{s^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{52}
\]
\[
676 = s^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
\]
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = s^2 - 676
\]

We also know that:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
\[
a + b + c = 2s
\]

Using the identity \( (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \):
\[
(2s)^2 = s^2 - 676 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
\[
4s^2 = s^2 - 676 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
\[
3s^2 = -676 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 3s^2 + 676
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = \frac{3s^2 + 676}{2}
\]

Finally, we use the fact that:
\[
abc = 312s
\]

To find \( AB \cdot AC = bc \), we need to express \( bc \) in terms of \( s \). However, we can use the fact that the product of the sides of a triangle can be found using the circumradius and the area:
\[
abc = 4R \Delta
\]
\[
abc = 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6s = 312s
\]

"To find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the second equation. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We can simplify this to:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Next, we need to find non-negative integer solutions to this equation. Let's consider the case when one of the variables is zero. Without loss of generality, assume \(c = 0\). Then the equations become:

\[
a + b = 300,
\]
\[
100(ab) = 2,000,000.
\]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[
ab = 20,000.
\]

We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) of non-negative integers such that \(a + b = 300\) and \(ab = 20,000\). The pairs \((a, b)\) are the roots of the quadratic equation:

\[
t^2 - 300t + 20,000 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):

\[
t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20,000}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]

This gives us the solutions:

\[
t = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \quad \text{and} \quad t = \frac{200}{2} = 100.
\]

So, the pairs \((a, b)\) are \((200, 100)\) and \((100, 200)\). Therefore, the corresponding triples \((a, b, c)\) are \((200, 100, 0)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\).

Next, we consider the case when two of the variables are zero. Without loss of generality, assume \(b = 0\) and \(c = 0\). Then the equations become:

\[
a = 300,
\]
\[
-a^3 = 2,000,000.
\]

This equation has no non-negative integer solutions because \(a^3 = 2,000,000\) implies \(a = \sqrt[3]{2,000,000} \approx 125.992\), which is not an integer.

Finally, we consider the case when all three variables are non-zero. We need to find non-negative integer solutions to the system of equations:

\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

We can use the fact that \(a, b, c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - k = 0\) for some integer \(k\). However, a simpler approach is to use symmetry and trial. We already found the pairs \((200, 100, 0)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\), and by symmetry, the pairs \((200, 0, 100)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), \((0, 200, 100)\), \((0, 100, 200)\), and \((100, 0, 200)\) are also solutions. Therefore, there are 6 such triples.

Thus, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) is not on any segment in the family \(\mathcal{F}\) and then calculate the square of the distance from \(O\) to \(C\).

First, let's determine the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line passing through \(A\) and \(B\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\), \(x_1 = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(y_1 = 0\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on this line segment such that \(C\) is not on any segment in the family \(\mathcal{F}\). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments of length 1 that are parallel to the line \(y = x\) and have one endpoint on the \(x\)-axis and the other on the \(y\)-axis. The point \(C\) must be such that the distance from \(C\) to the line \(y = x\) is greater than \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the line \(y = x\) is given by:
\[
\text{distance} = \frac{|x - y|}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
For the point \(C\) to be not on any segment in \(\mathcal{F}\), we must have:
\[
\frac{|x - y|}{\sqrt{2}} > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \implies |x - y| > 1
\]

Since \(C\) lies on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we substitute \(y\) in the inequality:
\[
|x - (-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})| > 1 \implies |x + \sqrt{3}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}| > 1 \implies |(1 + \sqrt{3})x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}| > 1
\]

We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality. The line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) intersects the \(x\)-axis at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and the \(y\)-axis at \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). The point \(C\) must lie between these two points, so \(0 < x < \frac{1}{2}\).

We solve the inequality:
\[
(1 + \sqrt{3})x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} > 1 \quad \text{or} \quad (1 + \sqrt{3})x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} < -1
\]

First, solve:
\[
(1 + \sqrt{3})x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} > 1 \implies (1 + \sqrt{3})x > 1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x > \frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1 + \sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2(1 + \sqrt{3})} = \frac{(2 + \sqrt{3})(1 - \sqrt{3})}{2(1 + \sqrt{3})(1 - \sqrt{3})} = \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} - 3}{2(1 - 3)} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{3}}{-4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

Next, solve:
\[
(1 + \sqrt{3})x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} < -1 \implies (1 + \sqrt{3})x < -1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x < \frac{-1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1 + \sqrt{3}} = \frac{-2 + \sqrt{3}}{2(1 + \sqrt{3})} = \frac{(-2 + \sqrt{3})(1 - \sqrt{3})}{2(1 + \sqrt{3})(1 - \sqrt{3})} = \frac{-2 + 2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} - 3}{2(1 - 3)} = \frac{-5 + 3\sqrt{3}}{-4} = \frac{5 - 3\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

Since \(0 < x < \frac{1}{2}\), we have:
\[
\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{4} < x < \frac{1}{2}
\]

The point \(C\) that is not on any segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) is the point on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) with \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). Substituting \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) into the equation of the line, we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\).

The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2} - 0\right)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\).

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the 13th roots of unity, which are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} = 1\).

"To determine the smallest base \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than 10 \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to find bases where the number of \( b \)-beautiful numbers exceeds 10. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) has exactly two digits in base \( b \), it can be written as \( \overline{ab}_b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the digits and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le b < b \). The value of \( n \) in decimal is \( ab + b \).

Given that the sum of the digits \( a + b = \sqrt{n} \), we substitute \( n \) with \( ab + b \):
\[ a + b = \sqrt{ab + b} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + b)^2 = ab + b \]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[ a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = ab + b \]
\[ a^2 + ab + b^2 = b \]
\[ a^2 + ab + b^2 - b = 0 \]
\[ b(a^2 + ab + b - 1) = 0 \]
Since \( b \neq 0 \), we have:
\[ a^2 + ab + b - 1 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( a \):
\[ a^2 + ab + (b - 1) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( a \) to be an integer:
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4(b - 1) = b^2 - 4b + 4 = (b - 2)^2 \]
Since the discriminant is a perfect square, the quadratic equation has integer solutions:
\[ a = \frac{-b \pm (b - 2)}{2} \]
This gives us two possible values for \( a \):
\[ a = \frac{-b + (b - 2)}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \quad \text{(not valid since \( a \ge 1 \))} \]
\[ a = \frac{-b - (b - 2)}{2} = \frac{-2b + 2}{2} = -b + 1 \]
So, \( a = b - 1 \). Substituting \( a = b - 1 \) back into the equation \( a + b = \sqrt{n} \):
\[ (b - 1) + b = \sqrt{ab + b} \]
\[ 2b - 1 = \sqrt{(b - 1)b + b} \]
\[ 2b - 1 = \sqrt{b^2 - b + b} \]
\[ 2b - 1 = \sqrt{b^2} \]
\[ 2b - 1 = b \]
\[ b = 1 \]
This is not valid since \( b \ge 2 \). Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) with each side and diagonal of the rectangle being a side or diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the geometric properties and combinatorial choices.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. Each pair of opposite sides or diagonals must be parallel and equal in length.

### Step 1: Identify the possible pairs of opposite sides or diagonals
A dodecagon has 12 sides and 54 diagonals (since there are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) line segments connecting any two vertices, and 12 of these are sides, leaving 54 diagonals). However, not all of these diagonals are of the same length.

### Step 2: Count the number of distinct lengths of diagonals
The diagonals of a regular dodecagon can be categorized by their lengths:
- The shortest diagonals connect vertices that are 2 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_3 \)).
- The next shortest diagonals connect vertices that are 3 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_4 \)).
- The next shortest diagonals connect vertices that are 4 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_5 \)).
- The next shortest diagonals connect vertices that are 5 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_6 \)).
- The longest diagonals connect vertices that are 6 vertices apart (e.g., \( A_1A_7 \)).

### Step 3: Count the number of pairs of opposite sides or diagonals for each length
For each length, we need to count the number of pairs of opposite sides or diagonals:
- For the shortest diagonals, there are 12 pairs of opposite sides or diagonals.
- For the next shortest diagonals, there are 12 pairs of opposite sides or diagonals.
- For the next shortest diagonals, there are 12 pairs of opposite sides or diagonals.
- For the next shortest diagonals, there are 12 pairs of opposite sides or diagonals.
- For the longest diagonals, there are 6 pairs of opposite sides or diagonals.

### Step 4: Sum the number of pairs for all lengths
Adding up all the pairs, we get:
\[ 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 54 \]

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed inside the dodecagon is \(\boxed{54}\).","[54, '54']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions and then calculate the sum of the squares of these integers. Let's break down the conditions step by step.

1. **Sum of the odd numbers is 30.**
2. **The median of the list is 9.**
3. **The median is a positive integer that is not in the list itself.**

### Step 1: Determine the list of numbers
Since the median is 9, the list must have an odd number of elements, and 9 must be the middle number. Let's denote the list by \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(n\) is odd. The median is \(a_{\frac{n+1}{2}} = 9\).

### Step 2: Ensure the sum of the odd numbers is 30
The odd numbers in the list must sum to 30. Since 9 is the median, it is an odd number. Therefore, the sum of the other odd numbers must be \(30 - 9 = 21\).

### Step 3: Ensure the median is not in the list
The number 9 must not be in the list itself.

### Step 4: Construct a possible list
Let's start with the smallest possible list that meets these conditions. If the list has 5 elements, it would look like \(a_1, a_2, 9, a_4, a_5\). The sum of the odd numbers is \(a_1 + a_2 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5 = 21\).

We need to choose \(a_1, a_2, a_4,\) and \(a_5\) such that they are all odd and not equal to 9, and their sum is 21. Let's try the smallest possible values:
- If \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 3\), \(a_4 = 5\), then \(a_5 = 21 - 1 - 3 - 5 = 12\). But 12 is even, so this doesn't work.

- If \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 3\), \(a_4 = 9\), then \(a_5 = 21 - 1 - 3 - 9 = 8\). But 9 is in the list, so this doesn't work.

After checking all possible combinations, we find that the list \(1, 3, 9, 11, 7\) works. The sum of the squares of the odd numbers is \(1^2 + 3^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 9 + 81 + 121 + 49 = 261\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find a way to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the digits in each row is 999 and the sum of the digits in each column is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we have the following conditions:
1. The sum of the digits in each row is 999:
   \[
   a + b + c = 999
   \]
   \[
   d + e + f = 999
   \]
2. The sum of the digits in each column is 99:
   \[
   a + d = 99
   \]
   \[
   b + e = 99
   \]
   \[
   c + f = 99
   \]

We can start by expressing \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 99 - a
\]
\[
e = 99 - b
\]
\[
f = 99 - c
\]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the row sum equations:
\[
a + b + c = 999
\]
\[
(99 - a) + (99 - b) + (99 - c) = 999
\]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[
297 - (a + b + c) = 999
\]

Since we know from the first equation that \(a + b + c = 999\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
297 - 999 = 999
\]
\[
-702 = 999

This equation is clearly incorrect, which means there is no solution to the problem as stated. Therefore, the number of ways to fill the grid is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",45,"[45, '45']",False
"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Since \(1 = 2^0\), we equate the exponents:

\[
0 = \frac{13}{12}
\]

This equation is not possible, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\), we can proceed as follows:

From the original equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other. From \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we get:

\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

We can substitute these into each other to find a relationship between \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product \(xyz\) can be found by multiplying the right sides of the original equations:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 1
\]

This implies:

\[
xyz = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z)
\]

Using the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of each other. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that:

\[
\log_2(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2(yz) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2(x) - \frac{1}{2} = \log_2(x)
\]

This is consistent, so we can use the fact that:

\[
\log_2(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2(yz) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2(x) - \frac{1}{2} = \log_2(x)
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\log_2(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2(yz) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \log_2(x) - \frac{1}{2} = \log_2(x)
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\) is:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \left|4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z)\right| = \left|4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\right| = \left|2 + 1 + \frac{1}{2}\right| = \left|\frac{7}{2}\right| = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Thus, the value of \(m+n\) is:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the given triangle \(ABCDEF\) is a regular hexagon with equal side lengths. The sides of the hexagon are \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DE\), \(EF\), and \(FA\). The problem states that the sides of the triangle formed by the segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the length of one side of the hexagon.

In a regular hexagon, the distance between two vertices that are two sides apart (like \(A\) and \(C\), \(C\) and \(E\), etc.) is equal to the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, the sides of the triangle \(ABCDEF\) are equal to the side length of the hexagon. Let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\).

The sides of the triangle are:
- \(AB = s\)
- \(CD = s\)
- \(EF = s\)

However, the problem states that the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300. This means that the sides of the hexagon are not all equal, but we can still use the fact that the sides of the triangle are the distances between the vertices of the hexagon.

The sides of the triangle are:
- \(AB = s_1\)
- \(CD = s_2\)
- \(EF = s_3\)

where \(s_1\), \(s_2\), and \(s_3\) are the side lengths of the hexagon. The sides of the triangle are the distances between the vertices of the hexagon, which are:
- \(AB = s_1\)
- \(CD = s_2\)
- \(EF = s_3\)

The sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300. Therefore, the side lengths of the hexagon are 200, 240, and 300.

The perimeter of the hexagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides:
\[
s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 + s_5 + s_6
\]

Since the hexagon is regular, all its sides are equal. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is:
\[
6s
\]

where \(s\) is the side length of the hexagon. The side length of the hexagon is the average of the sides of the triangle:
\[
s = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = 260

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the sets \( A \) and \( B \). The set \( B \) consists of all finite and non-empty subsets of positive integers whose maximum element is in \( A \). The number of such subsets for a given \( A \) is \( 2^{|A|} - 1 \), where \( |A| \) is the number of elements in \( A \). This is because each element of \( A \) can either be included or not included in a subset, except for the empty subset.

Given that the number of subsets in \( B \) is 2024, we have:
\[
2^{|A|} - 1 = 2024

Adding 1 to both sides, we get:
\[
2^{|A|} = 2025

We need to find the integer \( |A| \) such that \( 2^{|A|} = 2025 \). By checking the powers of 2, we find:
\[
2^{10} = 1024 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{11} = 2048
\]
Since 2025 is not a power of 2, we realize there was a miscalculation in the interpretation. The correct interpretation is that the number of subsets in \( B \) is 2024, which means \( 2^{|A|} - 1 = 2024 \) is not correct. Instead, we should consider the correct interpretation that the number of subsets in \( B \) is 2024, which means \( 2^{|A|} - 1 = 2024 \) is correct.

Thus, the correct interpretation is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that when each digit of \( N \) is increased by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote the digits of \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are the digits of \( N \) from left to right. The number \( N \) can be expressed as \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

When each digit is increased by 1, the resulting number is \( 1000(a+1) + 100(b+1) + 10(c+1) + (d+1) = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1111 \). This number must be divisible by 7. Therefore, we have:
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1111 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), and \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we can rewrite the congruence as:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 1111 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
Next, we need to find the remainder when 1111 is divided by 7. We have:
\[ 1111 \div 7 = 158 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
So, \( 1111 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \). Substituting this into the congruence, we get:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
or
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]

To maximize \( N \), we should start with the largest possible digit for \( a \), which is 9. Let's try \( a = 9 \):
\[ 6(9) + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( 54 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \), we have:
\[ 5 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv -3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

Next, we try the largest possible digit for \( b \), which is 9:
\[ 2(9) + 3c + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 18 + 3c + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( 18 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \), we have:
\[ 4 + 3c + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv -3c \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 4c \pmod{7} \]

To maximize \( N \), we should try the largest possible digit for \( c \), which is 9:
\[ d \equiv 4(9) \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 36 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

So, the largest possible value for \( d \) is 1. Therefore, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is \( 9991 \).

Now, we need to find the remainder \( R \) when \( N = 9991 \) is divided by 1000:
\[ 9991 \div 1000 = 9 \text{ remainder } 91 \]
So, \( R = 91 \).

Finally, we calculate \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 9 + 91 = 100 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) touches the sphere \( S \), and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's analyze the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle with radius 3 around a line that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The center of the sphere \( S \) is at the origin, and its radius is 11.

The torus \( T \) will touch the sphere \( S \) along two circles, one at the ""top"" and one at the ""bottom"" of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 units, and the radius of the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner surface of the torus is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units.

Since the sphere has a radius of 11 units, the torus will touch the sphere at two points, one at a distance of 9 units from the center and one at a distance of 3 units from the center. These distances correspond to the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus touches the sphere.

Thus, we have:
\[ r_i = 9 \]
\[ r_o = 3 \]

The difference between these radii is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 9 - 3 = 6 \]

The fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) is \( \frac{6}{1} \), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to color the cells of a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at most one cell of each color, and each cell that is not on the diagonal has a different color from its diagonal neighbor.

First, let's consider the problem in terms of permutations. Each row and each column must contain exactly one cell of each color, which means we are essentially looking for a permutation of the colors for each row and each column. Additionally, the cells that are not on the diagonal must have different colors from their diagonal neighbors.

This problem can be approached by considering the number of derangements (permutations where no element appears in its original position) of the colors. A derangement of a set of \(n\) elements is a permutation where no element appears in its original position. The number of derangements of \(n\) elements, denoted as \( !n \), can be calculated using the formula:
\[
!n = n! \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^i}{i!}
\]

For \(n = 5\), we have:
\[
!5 = 5! \left( \frac{(-1)^0}{0!} + \frac{(-1)^1}{1!} + \frac{(-1)^2}{2!} + \frac{(-1)^3}{3!} + \frac{(-1)^4}{4!} + \frac{(-1)^5}{5!} \right)
\]
\[
!5 = 120 \left( 1 - 1 + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{120} \right)
\]
\[
!5 = 120 \left( \frac{120}{120} - \frac{120}{120} + \frac{60}{120} - \frac{20}{120} + \frac{5}{120} - \frac{1}{120} \right)
\]
\[
!5 = 120 \left( \frac{44}{120} \right)
\]
\[
!5 = 44
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to color the cells of a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one cell of each color, and each cell that is not on the diagonal has a different color from its diagonal neighbor is \(\boxed{44}\).","[44, '44']",902,"[902, '902']",False
