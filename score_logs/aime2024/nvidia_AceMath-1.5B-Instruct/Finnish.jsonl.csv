"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time \( t \) in minutes that Aya spends kitting the horse, given the conditions provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( s \) is the speed in kilometers per hour at which Aya kites the horse.
- \( t \) is the time in minutes that Aya spends kitting the horse.

We are given two scenarios:
1. When Aya kites the horse at speed \( s \) km/h, the time spent kitting is 4 hours and 24 minutes, which is \( 4 \times 60 + 24 = 284 \) minutes.
2. When Aya kites the horse at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, the time spent kitting is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is \( 2 \times 60 + 24 = 144 \) minutes.

The distance kited in each scenario is the same, which is 9 kilometers. The distance can be expressed as the product of speed and time. Therefore, we can write the following equations:
1. \( s \times 284 = 9 \)
2. \( \left( s + \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 144 = 9 \)

Let's solve the first equation for \( s \):
\[ s \times 284 = 9 \]
\[ s = \frac{9}{284} \]

Now, let's substitute \( s = \frac{9}{284} \) into the second equation:
\[ \left( \frac{9}{284} + \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 144 = 9 \]

First, we need a common denominator to add the fractions:
\[ \frac{9}{284} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{284} + \frac{142}{284} = \frac{151}{284} \]

Now substitute this back into the equation:
\[ \frac{151}{284} \times 144 = 9 \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 284:
\[ 151 \times 144 = 9 \times 284 \]

Calculate both sides:
\[ 21744 = 2556 \]

This equation is not consistent, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the time \( t \) directly.

The time \( t \) in minutes can be expressed as:
\[ t = \frac{9}{s} \]
\[ t = \frac{9}{s + \frac{1}{2}} \]

We need to find a consistent value of \( t \) that satisfies both conditions. Let's use the given information to find \( t \):
\[ \frac{9}{s} = \frac{9}{s + \frac{1}{2}} \]

This equation is not consistent, so let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the time \( t \) directly in the context of the given conditions.

Given the problem constraints and the logical consistency, the correct interpretation is that the time \( t \) is the same in both scenarios, which is 284 minutes.

Therefore, the time \( t \) in minutes that Aya spends kitting the horse is:
\[ \boxed{284} \]","[284, '284']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for \(AP\) in the given problem, we start by using the Power of a Point theorem. The theorem states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle and a line through \(D\) intersecting the circle at points \(B\) and \(C\), the power of the point \(D\) with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the chord \(BC\) and also equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to the circle. In this problem, the tangent from \(D\) to the circle is \(DB\) or \(DC\), and the chord is \(BC\).

Given that \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we can use the Power of a Point theorem at point \(A\) with respect to the circle \(\omega\). The power of point \(A\) is \(AP \cdot AD\), and it is also equal to \(AB \cdot AC\). Therefore, we have:
\[
AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC = 5 \cdot 10 = 50.
\]

Next, we need to find the length of \(AD\). Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), \(D\) is the excenter of \(\triangle ABC\) opposite to \(A\). The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the distance from a vertex to the excenter opposite to that vertex:
\[
AD = \frac{bc}{s-a},
\]
where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the sides of the triangle opposite to vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively, and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. Here, \(a = BC = 9\), \(b = AC = 10\), and \(c = AB = 5\). The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{9 + 10 + 5}{2} = 12.
\]
Thus, the length \(AD\) is:
\[
AD = \frac{bc}{s-a} = \frac{10 \cdot 5}{12 - 9} = \frac{50}{3}.
\]

Now, we substitute \(AD\) back into the Power of a Point equation:
\[
AP \cdot \frac{50}{3} = 50.
\]
Solving for \(AP\), we get:
\[
AP = \frac{50 \cdot 3}{50} = 3.
\]

Since \(AP = 3\) can be written as \(\frac{3}{1}\), where \(m = 3\) and \(n = 1\) are coprime, we have \(m + n = 3 + 1 = 4\).

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon (8-sided polygon) can be cut into pieces such that each piece has at least one vertex that was originally a vertex of the octagon and that piece has all its vertices on vertices that were originally punts. This is a classic problem in combinatorial geometry and can be approached using the concept of Catalan numbers.

The number of ways to cut a regular octagon into pieces such that each piece has at least one vertex that was originally a vertex of the octagon and that piece has all its vertices on vertices that were originally punts is given by the 4th Catalan number. The \(n\)-th Catalan number \(C_n\) is given by the formula:
\[ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} \]

For an octagon, \(n = 4\), so we need to find \(C_4\):
\[ C_4 = \frac{1}{4+1} \binom{2 \cdot 4}{4} = \frac{1}{5} \binom{8}{4} = \frac{1}{5} \cdot 70 = 14 \]

The total number of ways to cut an octagon into pieces is given by the 7th Catalan number \(C_7\):
\[ C_7 = \frac{1}{7+1} \binom{2 \cdot 7}{7} = \frac{1}{8} \binom{14}{7} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 3432 = 429 \]

The probability that a random cut of the octagon satisfies the given condition is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{C_4}{C_7} = \frac{14}{429} \]

We need to express this probability in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers, and then find \(m+n\). The greatest common divisor of 14 and 429 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, \(m = 14\) and \(n = 429\), and:
\[ m + n = 14 + 429 = 443 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{443} \]","[443, '443']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"To find the number of intersection points of the curves \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into cases:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} + x \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) can also be broken down into cases:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} + x \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to evaluate \( f \) at this range:
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq \sin(2\pi x) < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - \sin(2\pi x) \).
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) < -\frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} + \sin(2\pi x) \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
Now, we need to evaluate \( g \) at the range of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- For \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq f(\sin(2\pi x)) < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).
- For \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) < -\frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} + f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will have a range of values depending on the range of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
Similarly, we need to evaluate \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) and then find the range of \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

### Step 7: Find the intersection points
To find the intersection points, we need to solve the equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). This is a complex task, but we can use symmetry and periodicity to simplify it.

By symmetry and periodicity, the curves \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will intersect at 4 points in each period of \( x \) and \( y \). Since the functions are periodic with period 1, the total number of intersection points is 4.

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given condition that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) for some prime \( p \). We need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is also divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since \( n \) is an integer, it is more useful to consider the factorization over the integers modulo \( p \). We know that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), which implies \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Squaring both sides, we get \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \). Therefore, the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8 but not a divisor of 4. The possible orders are 2 and 4, but since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the order cannot be 2. Thus, the order must be 4.

This means that \( p^2 \) must divide \( n^4 + 1 \) if and only if \( p \) is a prime such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). The smallest such prime \( p \) is 5, because \( 5^2 = 25 \) and \( 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82 \), which is not divisible by 25, and \( 4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 6^4 + 1 = 1296 + 1 = 1297 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 7^4 + 1 = 2401 + 1 = 2402 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 8^4 + 1 = 4096 + 1 = 4097 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 9^4 + 1 = 6561 + 1 = 6562 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 10^4 + 1 = 10000 + 1 = 10001 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 11^4 + 1 = 14641 + 1 = 14642 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 12^4 + 1 = 20736 + 1 = 20737 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 13^4 + 1 = 28561 + 1 = 28562 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 14^4 + 1 = 38416 + 1 = 38417 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 15^4 + 1 = 50625 + 1 = 50626 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 16^4 + 1 = 65536 + 1 = 65537 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 17^4 + 1 = 83521 + 1 = 83522 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 18^4 + 1 = 104976 + 1 = 104977 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 19^4 + 1 = 130321 + 1 = 130322 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 20^4 + 1 = 160000 + 1 = 160001 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 21^4 + 1 = 194481 + 1 = 194482 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 22^4 + 1 = 234256 + 1 = 234257 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 23^4 + 1 = 279841 + 1 = 279842 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 24^4 + 1 = 331776 + 1 = 331777 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 25^4 + 1 = 390625 + 1 = 390626 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 26^4 + 1 = 456976 + 1 = 456977 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 27^4 + 1 = 531441 + 1 = 531442 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 28^4 + 1 = 614656 + 1 = 614657 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 29^4 + 1 = 707281 + 1 = 707282 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 30^4 + 1 = 810000 + 1 = 810001 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 31^4 + 1 = 923521 + 1 = 923522 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 32^4 + 1 = 1048576 + 1 = 1048577 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 33^4 + 1 = 1185921 + 1 = 1185922 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 34^4 + 1 = 1331681 + 1 = 1331682 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 35^4 + 1 = 1490000 + 1 = 1490001 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 36^4 + 1 = 1658881 + 1 = 1658882 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 37^4 + 1 = 1835000 + 1 = 1835001 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 38^4 + 1 = 2025376 + 1 = 2025377 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 39^4 + 1 = 2225041 + 1 = 2225042 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 40^4 + 1 = 2441406 + 1 = 2441407 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 41^4 + 1 = 2673091 + 1 = 2673092 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 42^4 + 1 = 2924200 + 1 = 2924201 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 43^4 + 1 = 3194873 + 1 = 3194874 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 44^4 + 1 = 3486784 + 1 = 3486785 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 45^4 + 1 = 3782281 + 1 = 3782282 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 46^4 + 1 = 4103386 + 1 = 4103387 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 47^4 + 1 = 4448921 + 1 = 4448922 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 48^4 + 1 = 4802496 + 1 = 4802497 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 49^4 + 1 = 5198421 + 1 = 5198422 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 50^4 + 1 = 5625000 + 1 = 5625001 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 51^4 + 1 = 6092901 + 1 = 6092902 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 52^4 + 1 = 6590816 + 1 = 6590817 \), which is not divisible by 25, but \( 53^4 + 1 = 7116049 + 1 = 7116050 \), which is divisible by 25.

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to any of its faces, we start by calculating the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron and the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the tetrahedron meet, and the distance from the incenter to any face is given by the formula \( \frac{3V}{S} \).

First, we use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( AB = a \), \( AC = b \), \( AD = c \), \( BC = d \), \( BD = e \), and \( CD = f \) is given by:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = \sqrt{80} \), \( e = \sqrt{41} \), and \( f = \sqrt{89} \), we get:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 41 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
-25600
\]
The volume \( V \) is given by:
\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{-\det} = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{25600} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 160 = \frac{80}{3}
\]

Next, we calculate the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). The area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by Heron's formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]
where \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \). For our triangle, \( s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \). However, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) can also be found using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)}
\]
Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24\sqrt{21} = 6\sqrt{21}
\]
Since the tetrahedron has four faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[
S = 4 \cdot 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

Finally, the distance from the incenter to any face is:
\[
\frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{80}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{80}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{10}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{10\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]
Thus, \( m = 10 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \), and \( m + n + p = 10 + 21 + 63 = 94 \). The answer is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain all the right-angled triangles in the set \(\mathcal{B}\), and then determine \( r^2 \) in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. Finally, we need to find \( p + q \).

First, let's consider a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \). The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2}ab \]
and the volume \( V \) (which is actually the hypotenometric length in 3D, but we will use the area as a proxy for volume in this problem) is given by:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3}abc \]

Given that the area \( A = 54 \) and the volume \( V = 23 \), we have:
\[ \frac{1}{2}ab = 54 \implies ab = 108 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}abc = 23 \implies abc = 69 \]

From these two equations, we can solve for \( c \):
\[ c = \frac{69}{ab} = \frac{69}{108} = \frac{23}{36} \]

The circumradius \( R \) of a right-angled triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse:
\[ R = \frac{c}{2} = \frac{\frac{23}{36}}{2} = \frac{23}{72} \]

Since the smallest sphere that can contain all the right-angled triangles must have a radius at least as large as the circumradius of the largest triangle, the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere is:
\[ r = \frac{23}{72} \]

Now, we need to find \( r^2 \):
\[ r^2 = \left( \frac{23}{72} \right)^2 = \frac{529}{5184} \]

The integers \( p \) and \( q \) are 529 and 5184, respectively. Since 529 and 5184 have no common factors other than 1, they are coprime. Therefore, \( p + q \) is:
\[ p + q = 529 + 5184 = 5713 \]

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[

\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Similarly, applying the property of logarithms to the second equation, we get:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x)\) is the exponent to which \(y\) must be raised to get \(x\), we know that \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)\)
2. \(4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)\)

We can solve this system by eliminating one of the variables. First, we solve the first equation for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \left(\frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\right)
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\) (because \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
4xy = 100
\]

Solving for \(xy\), we divide both sides by 4:

\[
xy = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( n \) such that Bob has a winning strategy, and \( n \) is at most 2024. Let's analyze the game step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Game
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- Each playerpoins off 1 or 4 pelimerkkiä from the pile.
- The player whopoins off the last pelimerkin wins.
- Alice starts the game.

### Step 2: Identifying Winning and Losing Positions
We need to identify the positions (values of \( n \)) that are winning or losing for the player whose turn it is. A position is a winning position if the player can force a win, and a losing position if any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.

### Step 3: Base Cases
- \( n = 0 \): This is a losing position because there are no pelimerkkiä left to point off, and the player whose turn it is loses.
- \( n = 1 \): This is a winning position for Alice because she can point off 1 pelimerkin and win.
- \( n = 2 \): This is a winning position for Alice because she can point off 1 pelimerkin, leaving Bob with 1 pelimerkin, which is a winning position for Alice.
- \( n = 3 \): This is a winning position for Alice because she can point off 1 pelimerkin, leaving Bob with 2 pelimerkkiä, which is a winning position for Alice.
- \( n = 4 \): This is a losing position for Alice because she can point off 1 or 4 pelimerkkiä, leaving Bob with 3 or 0 pelimerkkiä, both of which are winning positions for Bob.

### Step 4: Generalizing the Pattern
From the base cases, we observe that:
- \( n = 4k \) (where \( k \) is a non-negative integer) is a losing position because any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.
- All other values of \( n \) are winning positions because the player can move to a multiple of 4, which is a losing position.

### Step 5: Finding the Values of \( n \) at Most 2024
We need to find all values of \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \) is not a multiple of 4. The multiples of 4 up to 2024 are:
\[ 0, 4, 8, 12, \ldots, 2024 \]

This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 0 \), the common difference \( d = 4 \), and the last term \( l = 2024 \). The number of terms \( k \) in this sequence can be found using the formula for the \( k \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ l = a + (k-1)d \]
\[ 2024 = 0 + (k-1) \cdot 4 \]
\[ 2024 = 4(k-1) \]
\[ k-1 = 506 \]
\[ k = 507 \]

So, there are 507 multiples of 4 up to 2024. Therefore, the number of values of \( n \) at most 2024 that are not multiples of 4 is:
\[ 2024 - 507 = 1517 \]

### Final Answer
The number of positive integers \( n \) at most 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen voittaa pääpalkinnon, given that she has already voittanut palkinnon. This means we need to find the probability that all four of her chosen numbers are among the four numbers chosen randomly from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \).

First, let's determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set \( S \). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Since Jen has already voittanut palkinnon, we know that the four numbers she chose are among the four numbers chosen randomly. Therefore, the probability that all four of her chosen numbers are among the four numbers chosen randomly is 1, because it is a certainty.

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{1} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). The sum \( m + n \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties.

First, note that since \(A, D, H, G\) lie on the same circle, quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic. Similarly, quadrilateral \(BCFE\) is cyclic because \(B, C, F, E\) lie on the same circle.

Given:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

We need to find the length of \(CE\).

Since \(BCFE\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, we can use Ptolemy's theorem, which states that for a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\), the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals. Applying Ptolemy's theorem to quadrilateral \(BCFE\), we get:
\[
BC \cdot EF + BF \cdot CE = BE \cdot CF
\]

However, we do not have the lengths of \(BF\) and \(CF\) directly. Instead, we can use the fact that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. This implies that \(E\) lies on the line segment \(DC\) extended. Therefore, we can use the fact that \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals of the cyclic quadrilateral \(BCFE\) when extended.

Since \(E\) is on the line \(DC\), we can use the fact that the power of a point theorem (also known as the intersecting chords theorem) can be applied. The power of point \(E\) with respect to the circle is the same for both chords \(BC\) and \(EF\):
\[
EB \cdot EC = EC \cdot ED
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides of the cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals. Since \(E\) is on the line \(DC\), we can use the fact that the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides of the cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of paths of length 16 in an \(8 \times 8\) grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path can be represented as a sequence of moves, where each move is either up, down, left, or right. Since the path changes direction exactly four times, it must consist of exactly five segments, each segment being a straight line in a single direction.

First, let's consider the total number of possible paths of length 16 in an \(8 \times 8\) grid. Each path is a sequence of 16 moves, and each move can be one of four directions (up, down, left, right). Therefore, the total number of paths is:
\[
4^{16}
\]

Next, we need to count the number of paths that change direction exactly four times. This means that the path can be divided into five segments, each segment being a straight line in a single direction. The number of ways to choose the directions for these five segments is \(4^5\), because each segment can be in any of the four directions.

However, we also need to consider the starting point of the path. The starting point can be any of the 64 squares in the \(8 \times 8\) grid. Therefore, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:
\[
64 \times 4^5

Now, let's calculate \(4^5\):
\[
4^5 = 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 1024

So, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:
\[
64 \times 1024 = 65536

"To find the maximum value of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)

Expanding both terms, we have:

The magnitude of this complex number is:

\[
\sqrt{(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta)^2 + (276\sin\theta + 432\cos\theta)^2}

Expanding the squares, we get:

\[
\sqrt{324^2\cos^2\theta + 432^2\sin^2\theta + 276^2\sin^2\theta + 432^2\cos^2\theta} = \sqrt{(324^2 + 432^2)\cos^2\theta + (432^2 + 276^2)\sin^2\theta}

Calculating the squares, we get:

\[
324^2 = 104976, \quad 432^2 = 186624, \quad 276^2 = 76176

So the expression inside the square root becomes:

\sqrt{100(2916\cos^2\theta + 2628\sin^2\theta)} = 10\sqrt{2916\cos^2\theta + 2628\sin^2\theta}

To maximize this expression, we need to maximize the expression inside the square root. The maximum value of \(2916\cos^2\theta + 2628\sin^2\theta\) occurs when \(\sin^2\theta = 1\) and \(\cos^2\theta = 0\), or when \(\cos^2\theta = 1\) and \(\sin^2\theta = 0\). In either case, the maximum value is 2916. Therefore, the maximum value of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given that the inradii of the other seven circles are known. The inradius \(r\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and area \(K\) is given by the formula:

\[ r = \frac{K}{s} \]

where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, \(s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}\).

We are given that the inradii of eight circles are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 2024. These circles are either tangent to each other or to the sides of triangle \(ABC\). The inradius of a circle that is tangent to the sides of a triangle is the inradius of the triangle itself, and the inradii of the other circles are the inradii of the triangles formed by the sides of \(ABC\) and the tangents to the incircle of \(ABC\).

The inradius of a triangle formed by a side of \(ABC\) and the tangents to the incircle of \(ABC\) is given by:

\[ r' = \frac{r}{2} \]

where \(r\) is the inradius of the original triangle \(ABC\). Therefore, the inradii of the other seven circles are half the inradius of triangle \(ABC\). Since the inradii of the other seven circles are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) must be 14.

The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be expressed in terms of the inradius \(r\) and the semi-perimeter \(s\) as:

\[ K = r \cdot s \]

Since \(r = 14\), we have:

\[ K = 14s \]

The area \(K\) of a triangle can also be expressed using Heron's formula:

\[ K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]

Equating the two expressions for \(K\), we get:

\[ 14s = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:

\[ 196s^2 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) \]

Since \(s \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(s\):

\[ 196s = (s-a)(s-b)(s-c) \]

The sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be expressed in terms of the inradius \(r\) and the semi-perimeter \(s\) as:

\[ a = s - r = s - 14 \]
\[ b = s - r = s - 14 \]
\[ c = s - r = s - 14 \]

However, this is not possible since the sides of a triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality. Therefore, we need to consider the correct values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy the given inradii.

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The asymptotes of this hyperbola are given by the equations \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 0\), which simplifies to \(y = \pm \frac{24}{20}x = \pm \frac{3}{2}x\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle inscribed in the hyperbola with its diagonals intersecting at the origin, the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be symmetric with respect to the origin. Let's assume \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\), and \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\). Because \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at the origin, and the slopes of \(AC\) and \(BD\) are negative reciprocals of each other.

Since \(A\) and \(C\) are on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Similarly, \(B\) and \(D\) also satisfy this equation. The length of \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD^2 = (x_2 - (-x_2))^2 + (y_2 - (-y_2))^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2).
\]

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to consider the properties of the hyperbola and the rectangle. The maximum value of \(BD^2\) occurs when \(B\) and \(D\) are at the points where the hyperbola is closest to the origin along the asymptotes. These points are \((x, y) = \left(\sqrt{20}, \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{20}\right)\) and \((-x, -y) = \left(-\sqrt{20}, -\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{20}\right)\).

Substituting these coordinates into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(\left(\sqrt{20}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{20}\right)^2\right) = 4\left(20 + \frac{9}{4} \cdot 20\right) = 4\left(20 + 45\right) = 4 \cdot 65 = 260.

- Let \( B \) be the set of asukkaat omistavat golfmailasetin.
- Let \( C \) be the set of asukkaat omistavat puutarhalapion.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of Aimevillen 900 asukkaat is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of asukkaat omistavat timanttisormuksen is \( |A| = 195 \).

- The number of asukkaat omistavat tarkalleen kolme näistä asioista is \( |A \cap B \cap C| = 234 \).

We need to find the number of asukkaat omistavat kaikki neljä näistä asioista, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| \]

However, we don't have the values of \( |A \cap B| \), \( |A \cap C| \), and \( |B \cap C| \) directly. Instead, we can use the information given about the number of asukkaat omistavat tarkalleen kaksi and tarkalleen kolme asioista to find the number of asukkaat omistavat kaikki neljä asioista.

The number of asukkaat omistavat tarkalleen kaksi asioista is:

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcircle center \( O \) and incircle center \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( I \) lies on the circle with diameter \( \overline{OA} \). The length of \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). The distance \( IA \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( OIA \):
\[
IA^2 = OA^2 - OI^2 = 13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2 = 169 - 13 = 156
\]
Thus,
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) is also the distance from the incenter to the vertex \( A \), which is given by the formula:
\[
IA = \sqrt{\frac{(bc(s-a))^2}{s^2}}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the sides opposite to vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively. However, we can use another approach to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed in two ways:
\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin B
\]
Using the inradius formula \( \Delta = r \cdot s \), we have:
\[
\Delta = 6s
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
6s = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A
\]
Since \( \sin A = \frac{2 \Delta}{bc} \), we substitute \( \Delta = 6s \):
\[
\sin A = \frac{2 \cdot 6s}{bc} = \frac{12s}{bc}
\]
Using the Law of Sines, we have:
\[
\frac{a}{\sin A} = 2R \implies \sin A = \frac{a}{2R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for \( \sin A \), we get:
\[
\frac{12s}{bc} = \frac{a}{2R}
\]
Since \( a = BC \), we can use the identity \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \):
\[
\frac{12 \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2}}{bc} = \frac{a}{2 \cdot 13} \implies \frac{6(a + b + c)}{bc} = \frac{a}{26} \implies 156(a + b + c) = abc
\]
However, we need \( AB \cdot AC = bc \). Using the identity \( R^2 = \frac{abc}{4K} \) and \( K = r \cdot s \), we get:
\[
R^2 = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 6s} = \frac{abc}{24s}
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), we have:
\[
R^2 = \frac{abc}{24 \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2}} = \frac{abc}{12(a + b + c)}
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \):
\[
169 = \frac{abc}{12(a + b + c)} \implies 2028(a + b + c) = abc
\]
Since \( a = BC \), we can use the identity \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \):
\[
2028 \cdot 2s = abc \implies 4056s = abc
\]
However, we need \( AB \cdot AC = bc \). Using the identity \( R^2 = \frac{abc}{4K} \) and \( K = r \cdot s \), we get:
\[
R^2 = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 6s} = \frac{abc}{24s}
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), we have:
\[
R^2 = \frac{abc}{24 \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2}} = \frac{abc}{12(a + b + c)}
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \):
\[
169 = \frac{abc}{12(a + b + c)} \implies 2028(a + b + c) = abc
\]
Since \( a = BC \), we can use the identity \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \):
\[
2028 \cdot 2s = abc \implies 4056s = abc

"To find the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) of negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We can simplify this to:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Next, we need to find negative integer solutions to this equation. Let's assume \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a, b, c\) are negative, \(ab, bc, ca\) are positive, and \(abc\) is negative. We will test possible values for \(a\) and see if we can find corresponding values for \(b\) and \(c\).

First, let's try \(a = -1\):

\[
100(b + bc - c) + 1 = 2,000,000 \implies 100(b + bc - c) = 1,999,999 \implies b + bc - c = 19,999.99.

Since \(b + bc - c\) must be an integer, \(a = -1\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = -2\):

\[
100(2b + 2bc - 2c) + 2 = 2,000,000 \implies 100(2b + 2bc - 2c) = 1,999,998 \implies 2b + 2bc - 2c = 19,999.98.
\]

Again, since \(2b + 2bc - 2c\) must be an integer, \(a = -2\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = -3\):

\[
100(3b + 3bc - 3c) + 3 = 2,000,000 \implies 100(3b + 3bc - 3c) = 1,999,997 \implies 3b + 3bc - 3c = 19,999.97.
\]

Again, since \(3b + 3bc - 3c\) must be an integer, \(a = -3\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = -4\):

\[
100(4b + 4bc - 4c) + 4 = 2,000,000 \implies 100(4b + 4bc - 4c) = 1,999,996 \implies 4b + 4bc - 4c = 19,999.96.
\]

Again, since \(4b + 4bc - 4c\) must be an integer, \(a = -4\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = -5\):

\[
100(5b + 5bc - 5c) + 5 = 2,000,000 \implies 100(5b + 5bc - 5c) = 1,999,995 \implies 5b + 5bc - 5c = 19,999.95.
\]

Again, since \(5b + 5bc - 5c\) must be an integer, \(a = -5\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = -6\):

\[
100(6b + 6bc - 6c) + 6 = 2,000,000 \implies 100(6b + 6bc - 6c) = 1,999,994 \implies 6b + 6bc - 6c = 19,999.94.
\]

Again, since \(6b + 6bc - 6c\) must be an integer, \(a = -6\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = -10\):

\[
100(10b + 10bc - 10c) + 10 = 2,000,000 \implies 100(10b + 10bc - 10c) = 1,999,990 \implies 10b + 10bc - 10c = 19,999.90.
\]

Again, since \(10b + 10bc - 10c\) must be an integer, \(a = -10\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's try \(a = -100\):

\[

Again, since \(1000b + 1000bc - 1000c\) must be an integer, \(a = -1000\) is not a valid solution.

We need to find a valid solution. Let's try \(a = -10000\):

\[
100(10000b + 10000bc - 10000c) + 10000 = 2,000,000 \implies 100(10000b + 10000bc - 10000c) = 1,999,900 \implies 10000b + 10000bc - 10000c = 19,999.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime positive integers. The point \(C\) is not equal to \(A\) or \(B\) and does not lie on any other line segment in the family \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\).

First, let's find the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line \(AB\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\), \(x_1 = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(y_1 = 0\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
So, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on this line such that \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\). Let the coordinates of \(C\) be \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) lies on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we can substitute \(y\) in the expression for \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}

We need to find \(x\) such that \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\) and \(C\) is not equal to \(A\) or \(B\). Let's try to find a rational solution for \(x\). We can test some rational values for \(x\) and see if they satisfy the equation.

Let's try \(x = \frac{1}{4}\):
\[
OC^2 = 4\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 - 3\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \frac{3}{4} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{16} - \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
So, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), which means \(OC = \frac{1}{2}\). The coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{4}, -\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\).

Therefore, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), and \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, \(\omega \neq 1\). The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} = 1\), which can be written as \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). This factors as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the 13th roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 13}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). First, note that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). The product can be rewritten as \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of this polynomial are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to evaluate the product \(P(\omega^2) + 2P(\omega) - 2\).

Using the fact that \(P(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\), we can write:
\[P(\omega^2) = \frac{(\omega^2)^{13} - 1}{\omega^2 - 1} = \frac{1 - 1}{\omega^2 - 1} = 0,\]
\[P(\omega) = \frac{\omega^{13} - 1}{\omega - 1} = \frac{1 - 1}{\omega - 1} = 0.\]

Therefore, the product becomes:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 2^13 - 2 \cdot 2^13 + 2^13 = 2^13 - 2^14 + 2^13 = 2^14 - 2^14 = 0.\]

However, we need to find the value of the product when divided by 1000. Since the product is 0, the value of the product when divided by 1000 is:

"To determine the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than 10 \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the definition of a \( b \)-beautiful number. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if its base \( b \) representation contains exactly two digits, say \( a \) and \( c \), and the sum of these digits equals the square root of \( n \). That is, if \( n = ab + c \) in base \( b \), then \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in terms of \( a \) and \( c \):
\[ n = ab + c \]
Given that \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \), we substitute \( c \) with \( \sqrt{n} - a \):
\[ n = ab + \sqrt{n} - a \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ n - ab + a = \sqrt{n} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ (n - ab + a)^2 = n \]
Expanding the left side, we have:
\[ n^2 - 2abn + a^2b^2 + 2a^2b - 2a^2 = n \]
Rearranging all terms to one side, we get:
\[ n^2 - (2ab + 1)n + a^2b^2 + 2a^2b - 2a^2 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( n \). For \( n \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant \( \Delta \) is given by:
\[ \Delta = (2ab + 1)^2 - 4(a^2b^2 + 2a^2b - 2a^2) \]
Simplifying the discriminant, we get:
\[ \Delta = 4a^2b^2 + 4ab + 1 - 4a^2b^2 - 8a^2b + 8a^2 \]
\[ \Delta = 4ab + 1 - 8a^2b + 8a^2 \]
\[ \Delta = 4ab(1 - 2a) + 8a^2 + 1 \]
For \( n \) to be an integer, \( \Delta \) must be a perfect square. We need to find the smallest \( b \ge 2 \) such that there are more than 10 solutions to this equation.

"To determine how many regular dodecagons (12-sided polygons) can be formed such that each side of the dodecagon is either a side or a diagonal of the regular dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of a regular dodecagon and its diagonals.

A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices and 12 sides. The diagonals of a regular dodecagon are the line segments connecting non-adjacent vertices. We need to count the number of regular dodecagons that can be formed using these sides and diagonals.

First, let's consider the structure of a regular dodecagon. A regular dodecagon can be divided into 12 isosceles triangles by drawing lines from the center to each of its vertices. Each of these triangles has a central angle of \(30^\circ\).

To form a regular dodecagon using the sides and diagonals of another regular dodecagon, we need to select a set of sides and diagonals such that they form a regular dodecagon. This means that the selected sides and diagonals must be equally spaced around the center of the dodecagon.

The only way to do this is to select every \(k\)-th vertex of the dodecagon, where \(k\) is a divisor of 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Each of these values of \(k\) corresponds to a different regular dodecagon:

- \(k = 1\): This is the original dodecagon itself.
- \(k = 2\): This forms a regular hexagon.
- \(k = 3\): This forms a regular quadrilateral (square).
- \(k = 4\): This forms a regular triangle (equilateral triangle).
- \(k = 6\): This forms a regular hexagon (the same as \(k = 2\)).
- \(k = 12\): This is the original dodecagon itself (the same as \(k = 1\)).

Since the values \(k = 2\) and \(k = 12\) both form the same regular dodecagon, and the values \(k = 3\) and \(k = 6\) both form the same regular hexagon, and the value \(k = 4\) forms the same regular triangle, we only count each unique regular dodecagon once.

Therefore, the number of distinct regular dodecagons that can be formed is the number of distinct values of \(k\) that are divisors of 12, which is 6.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions and then calculate the sum of their squares. Let's break down the conditions step by step:

1. **Listan alkioiden summa on 30.**
   This means the sum of all the numbers in the list is 30.

2. **Listan yksikäsitteinen moodi on 9.**
   This means that 9 is the only number that appears exactly once in the list.

3. **Listan mediaani on positiivinen kokonaisluku, joka ei esiinny listassa itsessään.**
   The median of the list is a positive integer that is not in the list. The median is the middle number in a sorted list. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

Let's start by considering the smallest possible list that satisfies these conditions. Since 9 appears exactly once, it must be the median of the list. Therefore, the list must have an odd number of elements, and 9 must be the middle element.

Let's try a list with 5 elements. The list would look like this: \(a, b, 9, c, d\) where \(a \leq b \leq 9 \leq c \leq d\). The sum of the elements is \(a + b + 9 + c + d = 30\), so \(a + b + c + d = 21\).

To minimize the sum of the squares, we should choose the smallest possible values for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are less than or equal to 9, and \(c\) and \(d\) are greater than or equal to 9, the smallest possible values are \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 9\), and \(d = 9\). However, \(c\) and \(d\) cannot both be 9 because 9 is already in the list. Therefore, the next smallest values are \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 10\), and \(d = 8\).

Let's check the sum:
\[1 + 2 + 9 + 10 + 8 = 30\]
This satisfies the sum condition. Now, let's check the median:
The list is \(1, 2, 9, 8, 10\), and the median is 9, which is not in the list. Therefore, this list satisfies all the conditions.

Now, let's calculate the sum of the squares of the elements:
\[1^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 + 8^2 + 10^2 = 1 + 4 + 81 + 64 + 100 = 250\]

Thus, the sum of the squares of the elements in the list is \(\boxed{250}\).","[250, '250']",236,"[236, '236']",False

"To solve the given system of equations involving logarithms, we start by converting each equation into its exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = 1
\]

This equation is not possible, which suggests there might be a mistake in the interpretation or the problem setup. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\), we can proceed as follows:

From the original equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other. From \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we get:

\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

We can substitute these into each other to find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product \(xyz\) can be found by multiplying the right sides of the original equations:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 1
\]

This implies that \(xyz = 1\). Now, we need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z)
\]

Using \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\), \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), and \(z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of each other. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(xyz = 1\):

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2\left(\frac{1}{x\sqrt{2}}\right) + 2\log_2\left(\frac{1}{xy}\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\left(-\log_2(x) - \frac{1}{2}\right) + 2\left(-\log_2(x) - \log_2(y)\right) = 4\log_2(x) - 3\log_2(x) - \frac{3}{2} - 2\log_2(x) - 2\log_2(y) = -\frac{3}{2} - 2\log_2(y)
\]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{x\sqrt{2}}\), we have:

\[
\log_2(y) = \log_2\left(\frac{1}{x\sqrt{2}}\right) = -\log_2(x) - \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substituting this back, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = -\frac{3}{2} - 2\left(-\log_2(x) - \frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{3}{2} + 2\log_2(x) + 1 = 2\log_2(x) - \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since \(x = \sqrt{2}\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x) = \log_2(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substituting this back, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\), and \(m = 1\) and \(n = 2\). The sum \(m + n\) is:

"To find the length of the side \( BC \) of the equilateral hexagon \( ABCDEF \) where the opposite sides are parallel and the sides \( AB \), \( CD \), and \( EF \) are given as 200, 240, and 300 respectively, we can use the property that the sum of the lengths of the sides of an equilateral hexagon is equal to the sum of the lengths of its opposite sides.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and the opposite sides are parallel, the sum of the lengths of the sides \( AB \), \( CD \), and \( EF \) is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides \( BC \), \( DE \), and \( FA \). Therefore, we can write:

\[
AB + CD + EF = BC + DE + FA
\]

Given that \( AB = 200 \), \( CD = 240 \), and \( EF = 300 \), we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[
200 + 240 + 300 = BC + DE + FA
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
740 = BC + DE + FA
\]

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the sides \( BC \), \( DE \), and \( FA \) are all equal. Let the length of each side be \( s \). Then we can write:

\[
BC = DE = FA = s
\]

Substituting \( s \) for \( BC \), \( DE \), and \( FA \) in the equation, we get:

\[
740 = 3s
\]

Solving for \( s \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[
s = \frac{740}{3}
\]

Therefore, the length of the side \( BC \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the conditions given and use them to find the sum of the elements in the set \( A \).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has a set \( A \) of positive integers.
   - Bob has a list of 2024 subsets \( B \) of positive integers, each of which has the property that the largest element in \( B \) is also in \( A \).
   - We need to find the sum of the elements in \( A \).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Each subset \( B \) in Bob's list has a largest element that is in \( A \). This means that every element in \( A \) can be the largest element of some subset \( B \).
   - Since there are 2024 subsets \( B \), and each subset \( B \) has a unique largest element (which is in \( A \)), it implies that there are at least 2024 elements in \( A \).

3. **Identifying the Elements in \( A \):**
   - The smallest possible largest element in \( A \) is 1.
   - The next smallest possible largest element is 2.
   - The next smallest possible largest element is 3.
   - And so on.
   - Therefore, the elements of \( A \) must be the first 2024 positive integers, i.e., \( A = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2024\} \).

4. **Calculating the Sum of the Elements in \( A \):**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Here, \( n = 2024 \).
   - So, the sum of the elements in \( A \) is \( \frac{2024 \cdot 2025}{2} = 2049300 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest non-negative integer \( N \) such that when any of its digits is replaced by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. We will then find the remainder \( Q \) and the quotient \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000, and finally compute \( Q + R \).

First, let's consider the properties of the number \( N \). If we replace any digit of \( N \) with 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. This implies that \( N \) must be congruent to 1 modulo 7 for each digit position where a 1 can be placed. Therefore, \( N \) must be a number where each digit is 1.

The largest such number is \( 1111111 \), because if we add another digit, it would be 11111111, which is larger than 1111111 but does not necessarily satisfy the condition for all digit positions. We need to check if 1111111 is divisible by 7.

Let's calculate \( 1111111 \mod 7 \):
\[
1111111 \div 7 = 158730.142857 \quad \text{(integer part is 158730)}
\]
\[
1111111 - 158730 \times 7 = 1111111 - 1111110 = 1
\]
So, \( 1111111 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).

This means that 1111111 is not divisible by 7. Therefore, we need to find the next largest number where each digit is 1 and check its divisibility by 7. The next number is 1111110, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 0. The next number is 1111101, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 0. The next number is 1111011, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 0. The next number is 1110111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 0. The next number is 1101111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 0. The next number is 1011111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 0. The next number is 0111111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 0.

The only valid candidate is 1111111, but we need to find the next largest number where each digit is 1 and check its divisibility by 7. The next number is 1111111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 1. The next number is 1111111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 1. The next number is 1111111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 1. The next number is 1111111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 1. The next number is 1111111, but it is not a valid candidate because it contains a 1.

Therefore, the largest non-negative integer \( N \) that satisfies the condition is 1111111.

Now, we need to find the remainder \( Q \) and the quotient \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000. We have:
\[
N = 1111111
\]
\[
Q = 111
\]
\[
R = 1111111 \mod 1000 = 111

Finally, we compute \( Q + R \):
\[
Q + R = 111 + 111 = 222

Thus, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the inner and outer tangent circles to the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \), and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's define the parameters:
- The radius of the torus \( T \) is \( R = 3 \).
- The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube is \( D = 6 \).
- The radius of the sphere \( S \) is \( R_s = 11 \).

### Step 1: Calculate the inner tangent radius \( r_i \)
The inner tangent circle is the circle that is tangent to the inner surface of the torus and the sphere \( S \). The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the inner tangent circle is \( D - R = 6 - 3 = 3 \). The radius of the inner tangent circle is the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner tangent circle minus the radius of the sphere:
\[ r_i = \sqrt{R_s^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{11^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{121 - 9} = \sqrt{112} = 4\sqrt{7} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the outer tangent radius \( r_o \)
The outer tangent circle is the circle that is tangent to the outer surface of the torus and the sphere \( S \). The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the outer tangent circle is \( D + R = 6 + 3 = 9 \). The radius of the outer tangent circle is the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer tangent circle minus the radius of the sphere:
\[ r_o = \sqrt{R_s^2 - 9^2} = \sqrt{11^2 - 9^2} = \sqrt{121 - 81} = \sqrt{40} = 2\sqrt{10} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
Now, we find the difference between the inner and outer tangent radii:
\[ r_i - r_o = 4\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{10} = 2(2\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{10}) \]

### Step 4: Express the difference in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \)
To express \( 2(2\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{10}) \) in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \), we need to rationalize the expression. However, since \( 2\sqrt{7} \) and \( \sqrt{10} \) are irrational and cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ways we can place 25 pelimerkkiä in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one pelimerkki, and each additional pelimerkki added to the grid is placed in a way that it does not violate the given conditions.

First, let's consider the initial \(5 \times 5\) grid with 25 pelimerkkiä. Since each row and each column must contain exactly one pelimerkki, this is equivalent to finding a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5 for each row. The number of such permutations is \(5!\) (5 factorial), which is calculated as follows:
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]
So, there are 120 ways to place the initial 25 pelimerkkiä in the grid.

Next, we need to consider the additional pelimerkki. The additional pelimerkki must be placed in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that it does not violate the conditions of the problem. Specifically, it must not be in the same row or column as any of the existing pelimerkki, and it must not be placed in a way that makes it easier to place additional pelimerkki in the future.

The additional pelimerkki can be placed in any of the 25 positions in the grid, but it must not be in the same row or column as any of the existing pelimerkki. This means that the additional pelimerkki can be placed in any of the 25 positions, but it must not be in the same row or column as any of the existing pelimerkki. Therefore, the additional pelimerkki can be placed in any of the 25 positions, but it must not be in the same row or column as any of the existing pelimerkki.

Since the additional pelimerkki can be placed in any of the 25 positions, and it must not be in the same row or column as any of the existing pelimerkki, the number of ways to place the additional pelimerkki is 25.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the 26 pelimerkkiä in the grid is:
