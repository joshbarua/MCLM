"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Aya spends walking and the time she spends in the cafeteria when she walks at different speeds. Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - \( s \) is the speed in kilometers per hour.
   - \( t \) is the time spent in the cafeteria in minutes.
   - \( d \) is the distance walked, which is 9 kilometers.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - When Aya walks at speed \( s \) kilometers per hour, the walking time is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes. Therefore, the walking time in hours is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \). The distance walked is given by:
     \[
     d = s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
     \]
     Since \( d = 9 \) kilometers, we have:
     \[
     9 = s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
     \]
   - When Aya walks at speed \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the walking time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes. Therefore, the walking time in hours is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours. The distance walked is given by:
     \[
     d = (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
     \]
     Since \( d = 9 \) kilometers, we have:
     \[
     9 = (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - From the first equation:
     \[
     9 = s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) \implies 9 = 4s - \frac{st}{60}
     \]
   - From the second equation:
     \[
     9 = (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) \implies 9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{(s + 2)t}{60}
     \]
     Simplify the second equation:
     \[
     9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60} \implies 9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{t}{30}
     \]

4. **Eliminate \( s \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:**
   \[
   9 - 9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{t}{30} - \left( 4s - \frac{st}{60} \right) \implies 0 = 2.4s + 4.8 - 4s - \frac{t}{30} \implies 0 = -1.6s + 4.8 - \frac{t}{30}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   1.6s = 4.8 - \frac{t}{30} \implies 4.8s = 14.4 - \frac{t}{5} \implies 24s = 72 - \frac{t}{5} \implies 120s = 360 - t \implies t = 360 - 120s
   \]

5. **Substitute \( t = 360 - 120s \) back into the first equation:**
   \[
   9 = s \left( 4 - \frac{360 - 120s}{60} \right) \implies 9 = s \left( 4 - 6 + 2s \right) \implies 9 = s \left( 2s - 2 \right) \implies 9 = 2s^2 - 2s \implies s^2 - s - \frac{9}{2} = 0
   \]
   Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
   \[
   s = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 18}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{19}}{2}
   \]
   Since \( s \) must be positive, we take the positive root:
   \[
   s = \frac{1 + \sqrt{19}}{2}
   \]

6. **Find \( t \):**
   \[
   t = 360 - 120 \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{19}}{2} \right) = 360 - 60 (1 + \sqrt{19}) = 300 - 60\sqrt{19}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time in hours when Aya walks at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Walking time} = \frac{9}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{9}{\frac{1 + \sqrt{19}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{9}{\frac{2 + \sqrt{19}}{2}} = \frac{18}{2 + \sqrt{19}} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{19}}{2 - \sqrt{19}} = \frac{18(2 - \sqrt{19})}{4 - 19} = \frac{18(2 - \sqrt{19})}{-15} = \frac{6(\sqrt{19} - 2)}{5}
   \]
   The total time in minutes is:
   \[
   \frac{6(\sqrt{19} - 2)}{5} \cdot 60 + t = \frac{36(\sqrt{19} - 2)}{5} \cdot 60 + 300 - 60\sqrt{19} = \frac{216(\sqrt{19} - 2)}{5} + 300 - 60\sqrt{19} = \frac{216\sqrt{19} - 432 + 1500 - 300\sqrt{19}}{5} = \frac{108\sqrt{19} + 1068}{5} = 21.6\sqrt{19} + 213.6
   \]
   Since \( \sqrt{19} \approx 4.3589 \):
   \[
   21.6 \cdot 4.3589 + 213.6 \approx 93.6 + 213.6 = 307.2
   \]
   Therefore, the number of minutes Aya's caminhada leva, including the \( t \) minutes gastos, is:

"To solve for the length \( AP \) in the given triangle \( ABC \) inscribed in a circle \( \omega \), we start by using the properties of the circle and the tangents to the circle.

First, we note that \( D \) is the point of intersection of the tangents to the circle \( \omega \) at points \( B \) and \( C \). The line \( AD \) is the polar of point \( D \) with respect to the circle \( \omega \), and it intersects the circle again at point \( P \).

By the Power of a Point theorem, we know that \( AD^2 = AB \cdot AC \). However, we need to find \( AP \) directly. We use the fact that \( P \) is the midpoint of the arc \( BC \) not containing \( A \). This implies that \( \angle BPC = 180^\circ - \angle BAC \).

We can use the formula for the length of a chord in a circle. The length of chord \( AP \) can be found using the formula for the length of a chord in terms of the sides of the triangle and the circumradius \( R \) of the triangle. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( P \) is the midpoint of the arc \( BC \) and the properties of the tangents and the circle.

The length \( AP \) can be found using the formula:
\[ AP = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{BC} \]

Substituting the given values \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \), we get:
\[ AP = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{9} = \frac{50}{9} \]

Thus, \( m = 50 \) and \( n = 9 \), and the sum \( m + n \) is:
\[ m + n = 50 + 9 = 59 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]","[59, '59']",113,"[113, '113']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octógono regular, with each vertex colored either red or blue independently with equal probability, can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices.

First, let's consider the total number of colorings of the octógono. Since each of the 8 vertices can be either red or blue, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of colorings where it is possible to rotate the octógono such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices. This means that the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, i.e., there must be exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices.

The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of 8 to be blue (and the remaining 4 to be red) is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\). Therefore, the number of such colorings is:
\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70
\]

Now, we need to determine the number of distinct rotations of the octógono that map a given coloring to itself. Since the octógono has 8 vertices, there are 8 possible rotations (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 positions clockwise). However, not all of these rotations will necessarily map the coloring to itself. The number of distinct rotations that map the coloring to itself is equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the number of blue vertices and the number of vertices, which is \(\gcd(4, 8) = 4\).

Thus, each distinct coloring can appear in 4 different ways under rotation. Therefore, the number of distinct colorings that can be rotated to have all blue vertices in the original positions of red vertices is:
\[
\frac{70}{4} = 17.5
\]

However, since the number of distinct colorings must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach. The correct interpretation is that each distinct coloring can appear in 4 different ways under rotation, but we need to count the number of distinct colorings that can be rotated to have all blue vertices in the original positions of red vertices. This is simply the number of distinct colorings where the number of blue vertices is equal to the number of red vertices, which is 70.

The probability that the octógono can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices is:
\[
\frac{70}{256} = \frac{35}{128}
\]

Since 35 and 128 are coprime, the probability is in its simplest form. Therefore, \(m = 35\) and \(n = 128\), and the value of \(m + n\) is:

"To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f \) and \( g \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions \( f \) and \( g \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \( f \) and \( g \):
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
  - If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
  - If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, let's consider the compositions \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) both range from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to evaluate \( f \) on this interval.

For \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \):
- If \( \sin(2 \pi x) \in [-1, -\frac{1}{2}] \cup [\frac{1}{2}, 1] \), then \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2 \pi x)| \).
- If \( \sin(2 \pi x) \in [-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}] \), then \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

For \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \):
- If \( \cos(3 \pi y) \in [-1, -\frac{1}{2}] \cup [\frac{1}{2}, 1] \), then \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3 \pi y)| \).
- If \( \cos(3 \pi y) \in [-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}] \), then \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

Next, we consider the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
- \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will be a function of \( x \) that ranges from 0 to 4.
- \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will be a function of \( y \) that ranges from 0 to 4.

To find the number of intersections, we need to determine how many times the curve \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) intersects the curve \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) within the interval \([0, 4]\).

Since both functions are periodic and symmetric, we can analyze one period and then extend the results to the entire interval. The function \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) has a period of 1, and the function \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) has a period of \(\frac{2}{3}\).

By symmetry and periodicity, we can conclude that each function will intersect the other function exactly 4 times in one period of the combined function. Since the combined function has a period of 1, the total number of intersections is:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, it is more useful to consider the factorization over the integers modulo a prime \( p \).

We need to find a prime \( p \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \) has a solution. Let's start by checking small primes.

### Step 1: Check \( p = 2 \)
For \( p = 2 \), we need \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \). Since \( n^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{4} \) for any integer \( n \), \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \) or \( 2 \pmod{4} \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by 4, so \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

### Step 2: Check \( p = 3 \)
For \( p = 3 \), we need \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \). We check the values of \( n^4 \pmod{9} \):
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{9} \).
Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by 9, so \( p = 3 \) is not a solution.

### Step 3: Check \( p = 5 \)
For \( p = 5 \), we need \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). We check the values of \( n^4 \pmod{25} \):
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1, 2, 3, 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 6, 7, 8, 9 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \).
Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by 25, so \( p = 5 \) is not a solution.

### Step 4: Check \( p = 17 \)
For \( p = 17 \), we need \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \). We check the values of \( n^4 \pmod{289} \):
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1, 16, 18, 19 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2, 15, 19, 18 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3, 14, 16, 17 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4, 13, 15, 18 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 5, 12, 14, 19 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 6, 11, 13, 16 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 7, 10, 12, 15 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 8, 9, 11, 14 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 10, 11, 12, 13 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its faces, we need to use the formula for the inradius \( r \) of a tetrahedron, which is given by:

\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} \]

where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( A \) is the total surface area of the tetrahedron.

First, we need to calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), \( c = AB \), \( d = AD \), \( e = BD \), and \( f = CD \) can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant:

\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}

1 & 41 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[ 288 V^2 = -288 \cdot 41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 \]

Thus,

\[ V^2 = 41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ V = \sqrt{41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89} = \sqrt{41 \cdot 16 \cdot 5 \cdot 89} = 4 \sqrt{41 \cdot 5 \cdot 89} = 4 \sqrt{18305} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total surface area \( A \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is an isosceles triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). The area of one such triangle can be found using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle is:

\[ s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \]

The area \( A_{\triangle} \) of the triangle is:

\[ A_{\triangle} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})} \]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) can be found using the formula:

\[ A_{\triangle} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)} \]

Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[ A_{\triangle} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24 \sqrt{21} = 6 \sqrt{21} \]

Since there are four such faces, the total surface area \( A \) is:

\[ A = 4 \cdot 6 \sqrt{21} = 24 \sqrt{21} \]

Now, we can find the inradius \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} = \frac{3 \cdot 4 \sqrt{18305}}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{\sqrt{18305}}{2 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{\sqrt{18305 \cdot 21}}{42} = \frac{\sqrt{384405}}{42} = \frac{61 \sqrt{95}}{42} \]

Thus, the inradius \( r \) is \( \frac{61 \sqrt{95}}{42} \). The values of \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) are 61, 95, and 42, respectively. Therefore, \( m + n + p = 61 + 95 + 42 = 198 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangular box as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The volume of the box is given by \(abc = 23\), and the surface area is given by \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\). We need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, which is the circumradius of the box. The circumradius \(r\) of a rectangular box is given by:

\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}
\]

First, we need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(abc = 23\) and 23 is a prime number, one of the dimensions must be 1. Without loss of generality, let \(a = 1\). Then \(bc = 23\) and the surface area equation becomes:

\[
2(1 \cdot b + b \cdot c + c \cdot 1) = 54 \implies 2(b + 23 + c) = 54 \implies b + c = 13
\]

We now have the system of equations:

\[
bc = 23 \quad \text{and} \quad b + c = 13
\]

We can solve this system by considering the quadratic equation whose roots are \(b\) and \(c\):

\[
t^2 - 13t + 23 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:

\[
t = \frac{13 \pm \sqrt{169 - 92}}{2} = \frac{13 \pm \sqrt{77}}{2}
\]

Thus, the dimensions of the box are \(a = 1\), \(b = \frac{13 + \sqrt{77}}{2}\), and \(c = \frac{13 - \sqrt{77}}{2}\). The circumradius \(r\) is:

\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{1^2 + \left(\frac{13 + \sqrt{77}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{13 - \sqrt{77}}{2}\right)^2}}{2}
\]

Simplifying inside the square root:

\[
\left(\frac{13 + \sqrt{77}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{169 + 26\sqrt{77} + 77}{4} = \frac{246 + 26\sqrt{77}}{4} = \frac{123 + 13\sqrt{77}}{2}
\]

\[
\left(\frac{13 - \sqrt{77}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{169 - 26\sqrt{77} + 77}{4} = \frac{246 - 26\sqrt{77}}{4} = \frac{123 - 13\sqrt{77}}{2}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
\frac{123 + 13\sqrt{77}}{2} + \frac{123 - 13\sqrt{77}}{2} = \frac{246}{2} = 123
\]

Thus, the circumradius \(r\) is:

\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 123}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{124}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{31}}{2} = \sqrt{31}
\]

The value of \(r^2\) is:

\[
r^2 = 31

Since 31 is a prime number, it can be written as \(\frac{31}{1}\), where \(p = 31\) and \(q = 1\). Therefore, \(p + q = 31 + 1 = 32\).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\), we obtain:

\[
x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Next, we apply the same property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x)\) is the exponent to which \(y\) must be raised to get \(x\), we know that \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(y)\), we obtain:

\[
4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Now we have two equations:

1. \(x \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \log_y(x) = 10\)

From the first equation, we can solve for \(\log_x(y)\):

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \(\log_y(x)\):

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\), we substitute \(\log_y(x)\) into this equation:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
10 \cdot 5 = 2y \cdot x

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a strategy to guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions.

First, let's define the positions:
- A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally.
- A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move will win if both players play optimally.

We start by identifying the base cases:
- If there are 0ichas left, the player whose turn it is to move loses (since there are noichas to remove). Therefore, 0 is a losing position.
- If there is 1icha left, the player whose turn it is to move can remove it, leaving 0ichas for the other player. Therefore, 1 is a winning position.
- If there are 2ichas left, the player whose turn it is to move can remove 1icha, leaving 1icha for the other player. Therefore, 2 is a winning position.
- If there are 3ichas left, the player whose turn it is to move can remove 1icha, leaving 2ichas for the other player. Therefore, 3 is a winning position.
- If there are 4ichas left, the player whose turn it is to move can remove 4ichas, leaving 0ichas for the other player. Therefore, 4 is a losing position.

From the above, we can see that the pattern repeats every 5 positions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Specifically, the losing positions are 0, 4, 9, 14, 19, ... and the winning positions are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, ...

To find the number of winning positions \( n \) less than or equal to 2024, we note that the losing positions are of the form \( 5k \) for non-negative integers \( k \). Therefore, the winning positions are of the form \( 5k + 1, 5k + 2, 5k + 3, 5k + 4 \).

The largest integer \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 is 2024. We need to count the number of integers of the form \( 5k + 1, 5k + 2, 5k + 3, 5k + 4 \) that are less than or equal to 2024.

First, we find the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 5k + 4 \leq 2024 \):
\[ 5k + 4 \leq 2024 \]
\[ 5k \leq 2020 \]
\[ k \leq 404 \]

So, \( k \) can take any integer value from 0 to 404, inclusive. For each value of \( k \), there are 4 possible values of \( n \) (i.e., \( 5k + 1, 5k + 2, 5k + 3, 5k + 4 \)). Therefore, the total number of winning positions is:
\[ 4 \times 405 = 1620 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. We will do this by using conditional probability.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins a prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the grand prize.

We need to find \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)}
\]
Since winning the grand prize implies winning a prize, \( B \cap A = B \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. Jen wins the grand prize if all four of her chosen numbers match the four numbers drawn randomly from \( S \). The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]
Since there is only one way for Jen's chosen numbers to match the drawn numbers, the probability \( P(B) \) is:
\[
P(B) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

Now, we calculate \( P(A) \), the probability that Jen wins a prize. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her chosen numbers match the drawn numbers. We will use the complement rule to find \( P(A) \). The complement of winning a prize is not winning a prize, which means fewer than two of her chosen numbers match the drawn numbers. There are two cases to consider:
1. No numbers match.
2. Exactly one number matches.

**Case 1: No numbers match.**

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 4 numbers are not drawn) is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]

**Case 2: Exactly one number matches.**

The number of ways to choose 1 number from the 4 numbers drawn and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Adding these two cases together, the total number of ways to not win a prize is:
\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to win a prize is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} - 95 = 210 - 95 = 115
\]

The probability \( P(A) \) is:
\[
P(A) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

Now, we can find \( P(B \mid A) \):
\[
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

The probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), and since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, we have:

m + n = 1 + 115 = 116

- \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles.

- Points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle.

From the properties of the rectangles, we know:
- \(AB = CD = 107\)
- \(BC = AD = 16\)
- \(EF = GH = 184\)

To do this, we can use the fact that \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle. This implies that \(AD\) and \(GH\) are chords of the circle, and the line segment \(AG\) is a diameter of the circle.

First, let's find the length of \(AG\):
\[ AG = AD + DG = 16 + 184 = 200 \]

Since \(AG\) is the diameter, the center of the circle is the midpoint of \(AG\). Let's call this center \(O\). The coordinates of \(O\) are:

"To determine the number of paths of length 16 that go from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid and change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Path**: A path of length 16 that goes from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid must consist of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U). The total number of such paths without any restrictions is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\).

2. **Direction Changes**: A path that changes direction exactly four times means that there are exactly four points where the direction of the path changes from right to up or from up to right. This implies that the path can be divided into five segments, each of which is either all right or all up.

3. **Counting the Paths**: To count the number of such paths, we need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (since there are 16 moves, there are 15 points where a direction change can occur) where the direction changes will happen. The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the configuration of the circles and the triangle. We have 2024 circles of radius 1, each tangent to the sides of the triangle \(ABC\) and to the previous circle in the sequence. This implies that the centers of these circles form a smaller equilateral triangle with side length equal to the side length of the original triangle minus twice the radius of the circles.

First, we need to determine the side length of the smaller equilateral triangle formed by the centers of the 2024 circles. Since each circle has a radius of 1, the side length of the smaller equilateral triangle is the side length of the original triangle minus \(2 \times 2024 = 4048\).

Next, we need to find the side length of the original equilateral triangle \(ABC\). The side length of the smaller equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the original triangle minus 4048. However, we need to find the side length of the original triangle in terms of the radius of the circles.

The side length of the original equilateral triangle can be found by considering the relationship between the side length of the smaller equilateral triangle and the side length of the original triangle.

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular and intersect at the origin.

Let the coordinates of the vertices be \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\), and \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\). Since these points lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

The lengths of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are given by:
\[ AC = 2|x_1| \quad \text{and} \quad BD = 2|y_1| \]

The product of the slopes of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) is \(-1\) because they are perpendicular. The slopes of \(AC\) and \(BD\) are \(\frac{y_1}{x_1}\) and \(\frac{y_2}{x_2}\), respectively. Since \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\) and \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\), the slopes are \(\frac{-y_1}{-x_1} = \frac{y_1}{x_1}\) and \(\frac{-y_2}{-x_2} = \frac{y_2}{x_2}\). Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{y_1}{x_1} \cdot \frac{y_2}{x_2} = -1 \]

However, we can simplify our problem by considering the maximum value of \(BD^2 = (2|y_1|)^2 = 4y_1^2\). Since \(A = (x_1, y_1)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies:
\[ \frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \]

To maximize \(y_1^2\), we need to minimize \(\frac{x_1^2}{20}\). The minimum value of \(\frac{x_1^2}{20}\) is 1 (since \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} \geq 1\)). Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \]
\[ -\frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 - \frac{1}{20} \]
\[ -\frac{y_1^2}{24} = \frac{19}{20} \]
\[ y_1^2 = -\frac{19}{20} \cdot 24 \]
\[ y_1^2 = -\frac{456}{20} \]
\[ y_1^2 = -22.8 \]

"To determine the number of residents of Aimeville who possess all four of the specified cothings (anel de diamante, conjunto de tacos de golfe, pá de jardim, e saco de corações de doce), we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of residents who possess an anel de diamante.
- Let \( B \) be the set of residents who possess a conjunto de tacos de golfe.
- Let \( C \) be the set of residents who possess a pá de jardim.
- Let \( D \) be the set of residents who possess a saco de corações de doce.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of residents is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of residents who possess an anel de diamante is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of residents who possess a conjunto de tacos de golfe is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of residents who possess a pá de jardim is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of residents who possess a saco de corações de doce is \( |D| = 900 \).
- The number of residents who possess exactly two of these cothings is 437.
- The number of residents who possess exactly three of these cothings is 234.

We need to find the number of residents who possess all four cothings, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

First, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Since every resident possesses at least one of the cothings, we have:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
\[
900 = 1964 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 1964 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - 900
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 1064 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|)
\]

We know that the number of residents who possess exactly two of these cothings is 437, and the number of residents who possess exactly three of these cothings is 234. Therefore, we can express the sum of the intersections of two sets and the sum of the intersections of three sets in terms of these values:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = \text{(number of residents who possess exactly two cothings)} + 3 \times \text{(number of residents who possess exactly three cothings)} + 6 \times \text{(number of residents who possess all four cothings)}
\]
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 + 3 \times 234 + 6 \times |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 + 702 + 6 \times |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 1139 + 6 \times |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Substituting this back into the equation, we get:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 1064 - (1139 + 6 \times |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|)
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 1064 - 1139 - 6 \times |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|)
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = -75 - 6 \times |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|)
\]

Since the sum of the intersections of three sets is not given, we can use the fact that the number of residents who possess all four cothings must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, we can solve for \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \) by trial and error or by logical deduction. By testing possible values, we find that:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 10
\]

Thus, the number of residents of Aimeville who possess all four cothings is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",73,"[73, '73']",False
"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the incenter \( I \) and the circumcenter \( O \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the triangle \( OAI \) is a right triangle with \( OI \) as one of the legs. The hypotenuse \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( IA \):
\[
OA^2 = IA^2 + OI^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
13^2 = IA^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2
\]
\[
169 = IA^2 + 13
\]
\[
IA^2 = 156
\]
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) is the distance from the incenter \( I \) to the vertex \( A \). The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) can be expressed in terms of the inradius \( r \) and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s
\]
We also know that the area \( \Delta \) can be expressed in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) of the triangle:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Substituting \( r = 6 \) and \( R = 13 \), we have:
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
\[
abc = 312s
\]

The semiperimeter \( s \) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \), which is \( bc \). Using the identity \( abc = 312s \), we can express \( bc \) in terms of \( s \):
\[
bc = \frac{312s}{a}
\]

To find \( s \), we use the fact that \( IA \) is the distance from the incenter to the vertex \( A \). The formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex \( A \) is:
\[
IA^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \), we get:
\[
(2\sqrt{39})^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
\[
156 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
\[
156s = bc(s-a)
\]
Since \( bc = \frac{312s}{a} \), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
156s = \frac{312s}{a}(s-a)
\]
\[
156 = \frac{312(s-a)}{a}
\]
\[
156a = 312(s-a)
\]
\[
156a = 312s - 312a
\]
\[
468a = 312s
\]
\[
s = \frac{468a}{312} = \frac{3a}{2}
\]

Now, we substitute \( s = \frac{3a}{2} \) back into the expression for \( bc \):
\[
bc = \frac{312s}{a} = \frac{312 \cdot \frac{3a}{2}}{a} = \frac{936a}{2a} = 468
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To find the number of trios of non-negative integers \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the given equation. Notice that the expression can be rewritten as:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), the equation becomes:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We can divide the entire equation by 3:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.
\]

To find a solution, we can try some possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equation, we get:

\[
100(100)(100) - 100(100)(100) = 1,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0,
\]

which does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) cannot all be equal.

Next, let's try another approach. Suppose \(a = 0\). Then \(b + c = 300\) and the equation becomes:

\[
0 + 0 + bc(0 + 0 + 0) = 0,
\]

which does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) cannot all be zero.

Now, let's try \(a = 1\). Then \(b + c = 299\) and the equation becomes:

\[
1 \cdot b + 1 \cdot c + b^2 + b^2 + c^2 + c^2 = 6,000,000,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
b + c + 2(b^2 + c^2) = 6,000,000.
\]

Since \(b + c = 299\), we substitute \(c = 299 - b\) into the equation:

\[
299 + 2(b^2 + (299 - b)^2) = 6,000,000.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

\[
299 + 2(b^2 + 89,401 - 598b + b^2) = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
299 + 2(2b^2 - 598b + 89,401) = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
299 + 4b^2 - 1,196b + 178,802 = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
4b^2 - 1,196b + 179,001 = 6,000,000,
\]
\[
4b^2 - 1,196b - 5,820,999 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\), where \(A = 4\), \(B = -1,196\), and \(C = -5,820,999\):

\[
b = \frac{1,196 \pm \sqrt{1,196^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-5,820,999)}}{8},
\]
\[
b = \frac{1,196 \pm \sqrt{1,430,416 + 92,975,984}}{8},
\]
\[
b = \frac{1,196 \pm \sqrt{94,406,400}}{8},
\]
\[
b = \frac{1,196 \pm 9,715}{8}.
\]

This gives us two solutions for \(b\):

\[
b = \frac{10,911}{8} = 1,363.875 \quad \text{(not an integer)},
\]
\[
b = \frac{-8,519}{8} = -1,064.875 \quad \text{(not an integer)}.
\]

Since neither solution is an integer, there are no integer solutions for \(b\) when \(a = 1\). By symmetry, there are no integer solutions for \(b\) when \(a = 2, 3, \ldots, 299\).

Therefore, there are no integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy both \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\). The number of such trios is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not belong to any segment in the family \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis.

First, let's determine the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line \(AB\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\), \(x_1 = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(y_1 = 0\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on this line such that the distance from \(C\) to the origin \(O\) is minimized, except for the segment \(\overline{AB}\) itself. Let \(C\) have coordinates \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) lies on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
The distance from \(C\) to the origin \(O\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}}
\]
To minimize \(OC\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \(4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}\). This is a quadratic function in \(x\), and its minimum value occurs at:
\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a} = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into the equation of the line, we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

Now, we calculate the distance \(OC\):
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{12}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{16}\). In this fraction, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), and since \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime, we have:
\[
p + q = 3 + 16 = 19

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, meaning \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:

\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \(\omega \neq 1\), \(\omega\) satisfies the equation:

\[
\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the remainder when the product

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

is divided by 1000. First, we simplify the expression inside the product. Notice that:

\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.
\]

However, a more useful approach is to consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) and evaluate it at the 13th roots of unity, excluding 1. The product we need is then \(P(\omega^0) P(\omega^1) \cdots P(\omega^{12})\).

First, we evaluate \(P(1)\):

\[
P(1) = 2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 1.
\]

Next, we evaluate \(P(\omega^k)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\):

\[
P(\omega^k) = 2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2 = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.
\]

We need to find the product of these values. Notice that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) can be written as:

\[
\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1.
\]

The polynomial \(P(x)\) can be rewritten as:

\[
P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 2.
\]

We need to find the product:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) = P(1) \prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k).
\]

The polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) evaluated at \(x = \omega^k\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) is the sum of the 12th roots of unity, which is \(-1\). Therefore, the product of \(P(\omega^k)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) is:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k) = (-1)^2 = 1.
\]

Thus, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k)\) is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1.

2. **Range of \( n \) in base \( b \)**: If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it must satisfy \( b \le n < b^2 \).

5. **Counting \( b \)-eautiful numbers**: For each possible value of \( d_1 + d_2 = k \) where \( \sqrt{b} \le k < b \), we need to count the number of pairs \((d_1, d_2)\) such that \( d_1 + d_2 = k \) and \( 1 \le d_1, d_2 < b \). This is equivalent to counting the number of integers \( d_1 \) such that \( 1 \le d_1 < b \) and \( 1 \le k - d_1 < b \). This simplifies to \( \max(1, k - b + 1) \le d_1 < \min(b, k) \).

6. **Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers**: The number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(b, k) - \max(1, k - b + 1) + 1 \). We need to sum this expression for all \( k \) in the range \( \sqrt{b} \le k < b \).

7. **Finding the smallest \( b \)**: We need to find the smallest \( b \) such that the total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers is greater than 10. We will calculate this for increasing values of \( b \).

Let's start with \( b = 2 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 2.
- For \( k = 2 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(2, 2) - \max(1, 2 - 2 + 1) + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 2.

Next, let's try \( b = 3 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 3.
- For \( k = 3 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(3, 3) - \max(1, 3 - 3 + 1) + 1 = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 3.

Next, let's try \( b = 4 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 4.
- For \( k = 4 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(4, 4) - \max(1, 4 - 4 + 1) + 1 = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 4.

Next, let's try \( b = 5 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 5.
- For \( k = 5 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(5, 5) - \max(1, 5 - 5 + 1) + 1 = 5 - 1 + 1 = 5 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 5.

Next, let's try \( b = 6 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 6.
- For \( k = 6 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(6, 6) - \max(1, 6 - 6 + 1) + 1 = 6 - 1 + 1 = 6 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 6.

Next, let's try \( b = 7 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 7.
- For \( k = 7 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(7, 7) - \max(1, 7 - 7 + 1) + 1 = 7 - 1 + 1 = 7 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 7.

Next, let's try \( b = 8 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 8.
- For \( k = 8 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(8, 8) - \max(1, 8 - 8 + 1) + 1 = 8 - 1 + 1 = 8 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 8.

Next, let's try \( b = 9 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 9.
- For \( k = 9 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(9, 9) - \max(1, 9 - 9 + 1) + 1 = 9 - 1 + 1 = 9 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 9.

Next, let's try \( b = 10 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 10.
- For \( k = 10 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(10, 10) - \max(1, 10 - 10 + 1) + 1 = 10 - 1 + 1 = 10 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 10.

Next, let's try \( b = 11 \):
- The possible values of \( k \) are 11.
- For \( k = 11 \), the number of valid \( d_1 \) values is \( \min(11, 11) - \max(1, 11 - 11 + 1) + 1 = 11 - 1 + 1 = 11 \).
- Total number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers: 11.

Since 11 is greater than 10, the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",211,"[211, '211']",True
"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the possible choices for the horizontal and vertical sides of the rectangle.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides, one pair horizontal and one pair vertical. The horizontal sides are the sides of the dodecagon, and the vertical sides are the diagonals connecting vertices that are not adjacent.

### Step 1: Count the number of ways to choose the horizontal sides
The horizontal sides of the rectangle are simply the sides of the dodecagon. There are 12 sides in a dodecagon, so there are 12 ways to choose the horizontal sides.

### Step 2: Count the number of ways to choose the vertical sides
The vertical sides are the diagonals connecting vertices that are not adjacent. In a dodecagon, a diagonal connects two vertices if the number of vertices between them is not 1 or 11 (since 11 is equivalent to -1 in modular arithmetic). Therefore, a diagonal connects two vertices if the number of vertices between them is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.

For each vertex \( A_i \), the possible vertices to which it can be connected by a diagonal are \( A_{i+2}, A_{i+3}, A_{i+4}, A_{i+5}, A_{i+6}, A_{i+7}, A_{i+8}, A_{i+9}, A_{i+10} \) (all indices taken modulo 12). However, each diagonal is counted twice (once from each end), so the total number of unique diagonals is:
\[
\frac{12 \times 9}{2} = 54
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of rectangles
Since the choice of the horizontal sides is independent of the choice of the vertical sides, the total number of rectangles is the product of the number of ways to choose the horizontal sides and the number of ways to choose the vertical sides:
\[
12 \times 54 = 648
\]

Thus, the number of rectangles that can be formed within the dodecagon is \(\boxed{648}\).","[648, '648']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions and then calculate the sum of the squares of these integers. Let's break down the conditions step by step.

1. **Sum of the items in the list is 30:**
   \[
   a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 30
   \]

2. **The mode of the list is 9:**
   The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Therefore, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list.

3. **The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list:**
   The median is the middle number in a sorted list. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The median must be a positive integer and it must not be one of the numbers in the list.

Let's start by considering the smallest possible list that satisfies these conditions. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's try a list with 5 elements (the smallest odd number of elements that allows a median):
\[
a_1, a_2, 9, a_4, a_5
\]
where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq 9 \leq a_4 \leq a_5\). The median is 9, which does not appear in the list. The sum of the elements is:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 = 30
\]
or
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5 = 21
\]
To minimize the elements, let's choose \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_2 = 1\):
\[
1 + 1 + a_4 + a_5 = 21
\]
or
\[
a_4 + a_5 = 19
\]
Since 9 is the mode, \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) must be greater than 9. The smallest possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are 10 and 9, but 9 is already in the list, so the next smallest values are 10 and 9. Therefore, the list is:
\[
1, 1, 9, 10, 9
\]
However, 9 appears twice, so it is not the mode. Let's try the next smallest values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\):
\[
a_4 = 10, a_5 = 11
\]
\[
1 + 1 + 10 + 11 = 23
\]
This sum is 23, which is greater than 21. Therefore, we need to try a different approach. Let's try a list with 6 elements:
\[
a_1, a_2, a_3, 9, a_5, a_6
\]
where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq 9 \leq a_5 \leq a_6\). The median is the average of \(a_3\) and \(a_5\), which must be a positive integer and not in the list. The sum of the elements is:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 9 + a_5 + a_6 = 30
\]
or
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6 = 21
\]
To minimize the elements, let's choose \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_2 = 1\):
\[
1 + 1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6 = 21
\]
or
\[
a_3 + a_5 + a_6 = 19
\]
Since 9 is the mode, \(a_3\) must be 9. The next smallest values for \(a_5\) and \(a_6\) are 10 and 11, but their average is 10.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, we need to try different values. Let's try \(a_5 = 10\) and \(a_6 = 11\):
\[
a_3 = 9, a_5 = 10, a_6 = 11
\]
\[
1 + 1 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 32
\]
This sum is 32, which is greater than 30. Therefore, we need to try a different approach. Let's try a list with 7 elements:
\[
a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, 9, a_6, a_7
\]
where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq a_4 \leq 9 \leq a_6 \leq a_7\). The median is \(a_4\), which must be a positive integer and not in the list. The sum of the elements is:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + 9 + a_6 + a_7 = 30
\]
or
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_6 + a_7 = 21
\]
To minimize the elements, let's choose \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_2 = 1\):
\[
1 + 1 + a_3 + a_4 + a_6 + a_7 = 21
\]
or
\[
a_3 + a_4 + a_6 + a_7 = 19
\]
Since 9 is the mode, \(a_3\) must be 9. The next smallest values for \(a_4\), \(a_6\), and \(a_7\) are 10, 11, and 12, but their sum is 33, which is greater than 19. Therefore, we need to try different values. Let's try \(a_4 = 8\):
\[
a_3 = 9, a_4 = 8, a_6 = 10, a_7 = 11
\]
\[
1 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 10 + 11 = 30
\]
This sum is 30, which is correct. The list is:
\[
1, 1, 8, 9, 10, 11
\]
The median is 9, which is not in the list. The sum of the squares of the elements is:
\[
1^2 + 1^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 = 1 + 1 + 64 + 81 + 100 + 121 = 368

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading from left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading from top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we have the following conditions:
1. The number formed by reading from left to right in the first row is \(100a + 10b + c\), and the number formed by reading from left to right in the second row is \(100d + 10e + f\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
   \]
2. The number formed by reading from top to bottom in the first column is \(10a + d\), in the second column is \(10b + e\), and in the third column is \(10c + f\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
   \]

Let's start with the first equation:
\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
From this, we can see that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\).

Now, let's consider the second equation:
\[
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]
Since \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), and \(f = 9 - c\), we substitute these into the equation:
\[
10(a + b + c) + ((9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c)) = 99
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
10(a + b + c) + 27 - (a + b + c) = 99
\]
\[
9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
\]
Subtracting 27 from both sides, we get:
\[
9(a + b + c) = 72
\]
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 8
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + d = 9\)
2. \(b + e = 9\)
3. \(c + f = 9\)
4. \(a + b + c = 8\)

From the fourth equation, we can express \(c\) as:
\[
c = 8 - a - b
\]
Substituting \(c\) into the third equation, we get:
\[
(8 - a - b) + f = 9
\]
\[
f = a + b + 1
\]

Now we have:
\[
d = 9 - a, \quad e = 9 - b, \quad c = 8 - a - b, \quad f = a + b + 1
\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to check the constraints:
- \(0 \leq a \leq 9\)
- \(0 \leq b \leq 9\)
- \(0 \leq 8 - a - b \leq 9\)
- \(0 \leq 9 - a \leq 9\)
- \(0 \leq 9 - b \leq 9\)
- \(0 \leq a + b + 1 \leq 9\)

The constraints \(0 \leq 9 - a \leq 9\) and \(0 \leq 9 - b \leq 9\) are always true. The constraint \(0 \leq 8 - a - b \leq 9\) simplifies to \(0 \leq a + b \leq 8\). The constraint \(0 \leq a + b + 1 \leq 9\) simplifies to \(0 \leq a + b \leq 8\), which is the same as the previous constraint.

Therefore, the only constraint we need to satisfy is \(0 \leq a + b \leq 8\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are digits, the number of possible pairs \((a, b)\) is the number of non-negative integer solutions to \(a + b \leq 8\). This is equivalent to the number of non-negative integer solutions to \(a + b + c = 8\) where \(c\) is a non-negative integer, which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8+2}{2} = \binom{10}{2} = 45\).

Thus, the number of ways to fill the grid is \(\boxed{45}\).","[45, '45']",45,"[45, '45']",True
"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = 1
\]

This equation is not true, which means there must be a mistake in the interpretation or the problem setup. However, if we assume the problem is correct and proceed with the given equations, we can find \(x, y, z\) by solving the individual equations.

From \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we get:

\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Substituting \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = (yz \sqrt{2}) z 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(y\) (assuming \(y \neq 0\)), we get:

\[
1 = z^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Solving for \(z^2\), we get:

\[
z^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]
\[
z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

Substituting \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) into \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Substituting \(x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\) and \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) into \(z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we get:

\[
2^{-\frac{5}{12}} = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}) y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = y^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{4}} = y^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = y^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12}} = y^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Solving for \(y^2\), we get:

\[
y^2 = \frac{2^{-\frac{5}{12}}}{2^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 2^{-\frac{5}{12} - \frac{1}{3}} = 2^{-\frac{5}{12} - \frac{4}{12}} = 2^{-\frac{9}{12}} = 2^{-\frac{3}{4}}
\]
\[
y = 2^{-\frac{3}{8}}
\]

Substituting \(y = 2^{-\frac{3}{8}}\) into \(x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\), we get:

\[
x = 2^{-\frac{3}{8}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}} = 2^{-\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{12}} = 2^{-\frac{9}{24} + \frac{2}{24}} = 2^{-\frac{7}{24}}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4 = \left(2^{-\frac{7}{24}}\right)^4 = 2^{-\frac{28}{24}} = 2^{-\frac{7}{6}}
\]
\[
y^3 = \left(2^{-\frac{3}{8}}\right)^3 = 2^{-\frac{9}{8}}
\]
\[
z^2 = \left(2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\right)^2 = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]

So,

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-\frac{7}{6}} \cdot 2^{-\frac{9}{8}} \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{6}} = 2^{-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}} = 2^{-\frac{12}{6} - \frac{9}{8}} = 2^{-2 - \frac{9}{8}} = 2^{-\frac{16}{8} - \frac{9}{8}} = 2^{-\frac{25}{8}}
\]

Therefore,

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \left|\log_2\left(2^{-\frac{25}{8}}\right)\right| = \left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}

"Given a regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, we need to find the length of one side of the hexagon. The problem states that the triangle formed by extending the segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300.

First, let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). Since the hexagon is regular and all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length \(s\).

When we extend the segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\), the resulting triangle has sides that are the sums of the side lengths of the equilateral triangles that form the hexagon. Specifically, the side lengths of the triangle are \(2s\), \(2s\), and \(2s\) for the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) respectively, but since they are extended, the actual side lengths of the triangle are \(2s + s = 3s\), \(2s + s = 3s\), and \(2s + s = 3s\).

However, the problem states that the side lengths of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300. This means that the side lengths of the triangle are not simply \(3s\), but rather the sides are formed by the extensions of the sides of the hexagon in a different configuration. The correct interpretation is that the side lengths of the triangle are the sums of the side lengths of the equilateral triangles that form the hexagon in a different way.

To find the correct side length \(s\), we need to consider the correct configuration of the triangle. The correct side lengths of the triangle are the sums of the side lengths of the equilateral triangles that form the hexagon in a different way. The correct interpretation is that the side lengths of the triangle are the sums of the side lengths of the equilateral triangles that form the hexagon in a different way.

The correct side length \(s\) can be found by solving the system of equations formed by the side lengths of the triangle. The correct side length \(s\) is the solution to the system of equations:
\[
2s + s = 200
\]
\[
2s + s = 240

\[
2s + s = 200

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the set \( A \) such that the number of finite non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers, where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \), is 2024. Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the subsets \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as the maximum element are all subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i - 1\} \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i - 1} \). Therefore, the total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{a_i - 1} \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n \). This can be written as:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n 2^{a_i - 1} = 2024

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that when any of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits.

First, we need to check the divisibility of \( N \) by 7. We will start by considering the largest four-digit number, which is 9999, and check if it satisfies the condition. If it does not, we will check the next largest number, and so on.

Let's start with \( N = 9999 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1999. We check \( 1999 \div 7 = 285.5714 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1999 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9999 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Next, let's try \( N = 9998 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1998. We check \( 1998 \div 7 = 285.4286 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1998 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9998 \) does not satisfy the condition.

We continue this process until we find a number that satisfies the condition. Let's try \( N = 9997 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1997. We check \( 1997 \div 7 = 285.2857 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1997 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9997 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9996 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1996. We check \( 1996 \div 7 = 285.1429 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1996 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9996 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9995 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1995. We check \( 1995 \div 7 = 285 \), which is an integer.
- If we change the second digit to 1, we get 9195. We check \( 9195 \div 7 = 1313.5714 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 9195 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9995 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9994 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1994. We check \( 1994 \div 7 = 284.8571 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1994 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9994 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9993 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1993. We check \( 1993 \div 7 = 284.7143 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1993 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9993 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9992 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1992. We check \( 1992 \div 7 = 284.5714 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1992 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9992 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9991 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1991. We check \( 1991 \div 7 = 284.4286 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1991 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9991 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9989 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1989. We check \( 1989 \div 7 = 284.1429 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1989 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9989 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9988 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1988. We check \( 1988 \div 7 = 284 \), which is an integer.
- If we change the second digit to 1, we get 9188. We check \( 9188 \div 7 = 1312.5714 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 9188 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9988 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9987 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1987. We check \( 1987 \div 7 = 283.8571 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1987 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9987 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9986 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1986. We check \( 1986 \div 7 = 283.7143 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1986 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9986 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9985 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1985. We check \( 1985 \div 7 = 283.5714 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1985 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9985 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9984 \):
- If we change the first digit to 1, we get 1984. We check \( 1984 \div 7 = 283.4286 \), which is not an integer.
- Since 1984 is not divisible by 7, \( N = 9984 \) does not satisfy the condition.

Let's try \( N = 9983 \):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles of tangency when the torus \( T \) touches the sphere \( S \) from the outside. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Step 1: Determine the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency
When the torus touches the sphere from the outside, the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the radius of the torus at the point of tangency. The radius of the torus at the point of tangency is the distance from the center of the torus to the circle of tangency.

### Step 2: Calculate the radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is on the inside of the sphere
When the torus is on the inside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency is the difference between the radius of the sphere and the radius of the torus at the point of tangency. The radius of the torus at the point of tangency is the distance from the center of the torus to the circle of tangency.

### Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the circle of tangency
The radius of the circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is 6 units, and the radius of the sphere is 11 units. Therefore, the radius of the circle of tangency \( r_i \) when the torus is on the inside of the sphere is:
\[
r_i = \sqrt{11^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{121 - 36} = \sqrt{85}
\]

### Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the circle of tangency when the torus is on the outside of the sphere
The radius of the circle of tangency \( r_o \) when the torus is on the outside of the sphere is:
\[
r_o = \sqrt{11^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{121 - 36} = \sqrt{85}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency is:
\[
r_i - r_o = \sqrt{85} - \sqrt{85} = 0
\]

### Step 6: Express the difference as a fraction and find \( m + n \)
The difference \( r_i - r_o \) can be written as \( \frac{0}{1} \), where \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 0 + 1 = 1 \).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to place the fichas in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains only one ficha of the same color, and no additional ficha can violate this condition. This means that the fichas must form a permutation of the rows and columns for both colors.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Choose the positions for the black fichas:**
   - We need to select 5 rows out of 5 for the black fichas. There is only one way to do this since we are choosing all 5 rows.
   - We then need to select 5 columns out of 5 for the black fichas. There is also only one way to do this since we are choosing all 5 columns.
   - Finally, we need to assign the black fichas to these selected rows and columns. This is equivalent to finding a permutation of 5 elements, which can be done in \(5!\) ways.

2. **Choose the positions for the white fichas:**
   - After placing the black fichas, we have 5 rows and 5 columns left, but some of these rows and columns may already contain black fichas.
   - We need to select 5 rows out of the remaining 5 rows for the white fichas. There is only one way to do this since we are choosing all 5 rows.
   - We then need to select 5 columns out of the remaining 5 columns for the white fichas. There is also only one way to do this since we are choosing all 5 columns.
   - Finally, we need to assign the white fichas to these selected rows and columns. This is equivalent to finding a permutation of 5 elements, which can be done in \(5!\) ways.

Since the placement of the black fichas and the white fichas are independent, the total number of ways to place the fichas is the product of the number of ways to place the black fichas and the number of ways to place the white fichas. Therefore, the total number of ways is:

\[
5! \times 5! = 120 \times 120 = 14400
\]

Thus, the number of ways to place the fichas is \(\boxed{14400}\).","[14400, '14400']",902,"[902, '902']",False
