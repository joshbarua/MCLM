"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( s \) and \( t \) based on the given conditions and then find the value of \( t \) when \( s = s + \frac{1}{2} \).

First, let's define the conditions given in the problem:
1. When \( s \) is the number of kiiloomitir and \( t \) is the number of daqiiqo, the total cost is 9.
2. When \( s + 2 \) is the number of kiiloomitir and \( t + 24 \) is the number of daqiiqo, the total cost is still 9.

We can express these conditions as two equations:
\[ s \cdot t = 9 \]
\[ (s + 2) \cdot (t + 24) = 9 \]

Expanding the second equation, we get:
\[ st + 24s + 2t + 48 = 9 \]

Since \( st = 9 \), we can substitute \( 9 \) for \( st \) in the expanded equation:
\[ 9 + 24s + 2t + 48 = 9 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 24s + 2t + 48 = 0 \]

Subtracting 48 from both sides, we get:
\[ 24s + 2t = -48 \]

Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ 12s + t = -24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( st = 9 \)
2. \( 12s + t = -24 \)

We can solve the second equation for \( t \):
\[ t = -24 - 12s \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( t \) into the first equation:
\[ s(-24 - 12s) = 9 \]

Expanding this, we get:
\[ -24s - 12s^2 = 9 \]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[ 12s^2 + 24s + 9 = 0 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 3:
\[ 4s^2 + 8s + 3 = 0 \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = 3 \):
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}}{2 \cdot 4} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 48}}{8} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{16}}{8} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm 4}{8} \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \( s \):
\[ s = \frac{-8 + 4}{8} = \frac{-4}{8} = -\frac{1}{2} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 - 4}{8} = \frac{-12}{8} = -\frac{3}{2} \]

Since \( s \) represents the number of kiiloomitir, it must be a positive value. Therefore, we discard \( s = -\frac{1}{2} \) and \( s = -\frac{3}{2} \) and conclude that there is no valid solution for \( s \) that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

However, if we assume the problem is asking for the value of \( t \) when \( s = s + \frac{1}{2} \), we can use the relationship \( t = -24 - 12s \) to find \( t \) for \( s = -\frac{1}{2} \):
\[ t = -24 - 12 \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \]
\[ t = -24 + 6 \]
\[ t = -18 \]

Thus, the value of \( t \) when \( s = s + \frac{1}{2} \) is \(\boxed{-18}\).","[-18, '-18']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of \(AP\) where \(P\) is the point where the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) intersects the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\). We start by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) divides the opposite side \(BC\) into segments proportional to the adjacent sides \(AB\) and \(AC\).

Given:
\[ AB = 5, \quad BC = 9, \quad AC = 10 \]

Using the Angle Bisector Theorem:
\[ \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Let \(BD = x\) and \(DC = y\). Then:
\[ \frac{x}{y} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ 2x = y \]

Since \(BD + DC = BC\):
\[ x + 2x = 9 \]
\[ 3x = 9 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
\[ y = 6 \]

Thus, \(BD = 3\) and \(DC = 6\).

Next, we use the fact that \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisector \(AD\) with the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\). By the properties of the circumcircle and the angle bisector, \(P\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) that does not contain \(A\). Therefore, \(P\) is the point where the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\) intersects the circumcircle.

To find \(AP\), we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle:
\[ AP = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ AP = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5 + 10)^2}\right)} \]
\[ AP = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{15^2}\right)} \]
\[ AP = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right)} \]
\[ AP = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{9}{25}\right)} \]
\[ AP = \sqrt{50 \left(\frac{16}{25}\right)} \]
\[ AP = \sqrt{32} \]
\[ AP = 4\sqrt{2} \]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 4\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore:
\[ m + n = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the numbers on the two dice is 7, and then find the maximum value of \( m + n \) where the probability is expressed as \( \frac{m}{n} \) in simplest form.

First, let's list all the possible outcomes when two dice are rolled. Each die has 6 faces, so there are \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) possible outcomes in total.

Next, we identify the outcomes that result in a sum of 7. These outcomes are:
- (1, 6)
- (2, 5)
- (3, 4)
- (4, 3)
- (5, 2)
- (6, 1)

There are 6 such outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is:
\[
\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

The fraction \( \frac{1}{6} \) is already in its simplest form, where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 6 \). The sum \( m + n \) is:
\[
1 + 6 = 7

Thus, the maximum value of \( m + n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",371,"[371, '371']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given equations and understand the behavior of the functions involved. Let's start by examining the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

The function \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) can be broken down as follows:
- If \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( |x| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).

The function \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \) can be broken down as follows:
- If \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( |x| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).

Now, let's consider the equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \). First, we need to determine the range of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \). Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we have:
- If \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \), which ranges from \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \) to \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( |\sin(2\pi x)| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \), which ranges from \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \). Next, we need to determine the range of \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \). Since \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \), we have:
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \), which ranges from \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \), which ranges from \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} - 0 = \frac{1}{4} \).

Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \). Consequently, \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) ranges from \( 4 \cdot -\frac{1}{4} = -1 \) to \( 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 \).

Now, let's consider the equation \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). First, we need to determine the range of \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \). Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we have:
- If \( |\cos(3\pi y)| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \), which ranges from \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \) to \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( |\cos(3\pi y)| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| \), which ranges from \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \). Next, we need to determine the range of \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). Since \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \), we have:
- If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \), which ranges from \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \), which ranges from \( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} - 0 = \frac{1}{4} \).

Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \). Consequently, \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) ranges from \( 4 \cdot -\frac{1}{4} = -1 \) to \( 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 \).

Since the ranges of \( y \) and \( x \) are the same, the solution to the system of equations is that \( x = y \). Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \( p \) and \( m \) such that both \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \) are divisible by \( p^2 \) and \( m^2 \) respectively. Let's start by analyzing the expression \( n^4 + 1 \).

First, we can factorize \( n^4 + 1 \) as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^4 + 2n^2 + 1) - 2n^2 = (n^2 + 1)^2 - (n\sqrt{2})^2 = (n^2 + n\sqrt{2} + 1)(n^2 - n\sqrt{2} + 1).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to one of its vertices, say \( A \), and express it in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \).

First, we note that the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) is isosceles with \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \). This tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge length \( s = \sqrt{41} \).

The formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex of a regular tetrahedron is given by:

x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\log_b(b) = 1\). Therefore, \(\log_x(x) = 1\) and \(\log_y(y) = 1\). Rewriting the equations, we have:

\[
x \cdot 1 = 10 \implies x = 10
\]
\[
4y \cdot 1 = 10 \implies 4y = 10 \implies y = \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we need to find the product \(xy\):

\[
xy = 10 \cdot \frac{5}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of tokens Alice needs to give to Bob so that Bob can buy a token with either 1 or 4 tokens, and then continue buying tokens with the remaining tokens.

Let's denote the number of tokens Alice gives to Bob as \( x \). After giving \( x \) tokens to Bob, Alice will have \( n - x \) tokens left. Bob can buy a token with either 1 or 4 tokens. If Bob buys a token with 1 token, he will have \( n - x - 1 \) tokens left. If Bob buys a token with 4 tokens, he will have \( n - x - 4 \) tokens left.

To ensure that Bob can continue buying tokens, the remaining tokens after buying one token must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where Bob buys a token with 4 tokens. In this case, the remaining tokens must be at least 1, so we have:
\[ n - x - 4 \geq 1 \]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ n - x \geq 5 \]
\[ x \leq n - 5 \]

To minimize the number of tokens Alice gives to Bob, we should give him the maximum number of tokens possible, which is \( n - 5 \). Therefore, the minimum number of tokens Alice needs to give to Bob is:

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of similar triangles and the given lengths. Let's break it down step by step.

First, note that the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, and the points \(A, D, H, G\) are also collinear. This implies that triangles \(ABE\) and \(FGH\) are similar because they share the same angles due to the collinearity of the points.

Given:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

Since triangles \(ABE\) and \(FGH\) are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{AB}{FG} = \frac{BE}{GH} = \frac{AE}{FH}
\]

We are given \(AB\) and \(FG\), so we can find the ratio:
\[
\frac{AB}{FG} = \frac{107}{17}
\]

We need to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(E\) is on the line segment \(BC\) and \(C\) is a vertex of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we can use the fact that \(E\) divides \(BC\) in a certain ratio. However, we need to find the length of \(CE\) directly from the given information.

Notice that \(EF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(EFC\) with \(FC\) as one of the legs. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(CE\):
\[
EF^2 = CE^2 + FC^2
\]

We know \(EF = 184\) and \(FC = BC - BF\). Since \(F\) is on the line segment \(BC\) and \(B\) is a vertex of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we can find \(BF\) by using the similarity ratio. However, we can directly use the given length of \(EF\) and the fact that \(F\) is on \(BC\) to find \(CE\).

Since \(F\) is on \(BC\) and \(E\) is on \(BC\), we can use the fact that \(E\) divides \(BC\) in a certain ratio. However, we need to find the length of \(CE\) directly from the given information.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
184^2 = CE^2 + 16^2
\]
\[
33856 = CE^2 + 256
\]
\[
CE^2 = 33856 - 256

\[
CE^2 = 33600

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to tile a \(8 \times 8\) grid with \(1 \times 2\) dominoes. Each domino covers exactly two squares of the grid.

First, let's consider the total number of squares in the \(8 \times 8\) grid. Since the grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, the total number of squares is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Each domino covers 2 squares, so to cover the entire grid, we need:

Now, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these 32 dominoes on the grid.

"To solve the given problem, we need to find the value of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) given that \(|z| = 4\). Let's proceed step by step.

First, let's express \(z\) in its polar form. Since \(|z| = 4\), we can write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) for some angle \(\theta\). The complex conjugate of \(z\) is \(\overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta}\).

Now, substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}.
\]
Simplify the second term:
\[
\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{e^{i\theta}} = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta}.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Next, we use the fact that \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substitute these into the expression:
\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]
Expand both terms:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta).
\]
Simplify the real and imaginary parts:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 432\cos\theta).
\]
Factor out the common terms:
\[
36(9\cos\theta - 12\sin\theta) + i(108\sin\theta + 120\cos\theta).
\]
Notice that the expression inside the parentheses can be written in a form that suggests a specific value. To find this value, we can use the fact that the expression must be a real number because the original expression is real (since it is a sum of a complex number and its conjugate divided by a complex number with magnitude 4, which is real). Therefore, the imaginary part must be zero:
\[
108\sin\theta + 120\cos\theta = 0.
\]
Solve for \(\tan\theta\):
\[
108\sin\theta = -120\cos\theta \implies \tan\theta = -\frac{120}{108} = -\frac{10}{9}.
\]
Now substitute \(\tan\theta = -\frac{10}{9}\) back into the real part:
\[
36(9\cos\theta - 12\sin\theta).
\]
Using \(\sin\theta = -\frac{10}{\sqrt{181}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{9}{\sqrt{181}}\):
\[
36\left(9 \cdot \frac{9}{\sqrt{181}} - 12 \cdot -\frac{10}{\sqrt{181}}\right) = 36\left(\frac{81}{\sqrt{181}} + \frac{120}{\sqrt{181}}\right) = 36 \cdot \frac{201}{\sqrt{181}} = 36 \cdot \frac{201}{\sqrt{181}} = 36 \cdot 201 = 7236.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of triangle \(ABC\) given that the radius of the incircle is 1 and the radius of the circumcircle is 2024. The formula for the area \(K\) of a triangle in terms of its inradius \(r\) and circumradius \(R\) is given by:

\[ K = r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R} \]

where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle and \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the sides of the triangle. Since \(r = 1\) and \(R = 2024\), we have:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The hyperbola is centered at the origin with a horizontal transverse axis. The vertices of the hyperbola are located at \((\pm a, 0)\), where \(a^2 = 20\), so \(a = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\). The foci of the hyperbola are located at \((\pm c, 0)\), where \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 20 + 24 = 44\), so \(c = \sqrt{44} = 2\sqrt{11}\).

We are given that \(ABCD\) is a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola with one of its diagonals along the x-axis. Let the vertices of the rhombus be \(A(x_1, y_1)\), \(B(x_2, y_2)\), \(C(x_3, y_3)\), and \(D(x_4, y_4)\). Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. The diagonal along the x-axis is \(BD\), so the other diagonal \(AC\) must be along the y-axis.

Let the coordinates of \(B\) and \(D\) be \((x, y)\) and \((-x, y)\) respectively, and the coordinates of \(A\) and \(C\) be \((x, -y)\) and \((-x, -y)\) respectively. Since \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

The length of diagonal \(BD\) is \(2x\). To find \(x\), we use the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1.
\]
However, we do not need the exact value of \(y\) to find \(BD^2\). We only need to know that \(x\) is a positive real number that satisfies the hyperbola equation. The length of diagonal \(BD\) is \(2x\), so the square of the length of diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
BD^2 = (2x)^2 = 4x^2.
\]
From the hyperbola equation, we can express \(x^2\) in terms of \(y^2\):
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} = 1 + \frac{y^2}{24} \implies x^2 = 20 \left(1 + \frac{y^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{20y^2}{24} = 20 + \frac{5y^2}{6}.
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4 \left(20 + \frac{5y^2}{6}\right) = 80 + \frac{20y^2}{3}.
\]
However, we do not need the exact value of \(y^2\) to find the constant term in \(BD^2\). The constant term is 80, which is the part of \(BD^2\) that does not depend on \(y\). Therefore, the value of \(BD^2\) is:
\[

"To determine the total number of golf balls sent to the players in Aimeville, we need to add the number of golf balls sent by the father and the number of golf balls sent by the son. The father sent 367 golf balls, and the son sent 234 golf balls. We can find the total by performing the following addition:

\[ 367 + 234 \]

First, we add the units place: \(7 + 4 = 11\). We write down 1 and carry over 1 to the tens place. Next, we add the tens place along with the carry-over: \(6 + 3 + 1 = 10\). We write down 0 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place. Finally, we add the hundreds place along with the carry-over: \(3 + 2 + 1 = 6\).

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) has incenter \( I \) and circumcenter \( O \) such that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), and the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \), we need to find the value of \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance \( OI \) between the incenter and the circumcenter of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( I \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OA \). The length of \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). Therefore, \( I \) is at a distance of \( \sqrt{13} \) from \( O \).

Next, we use the fact that the distance from the incenter to a vertex of the triangle is given by:
\[
IA = \sqrt{R(R - 2r) + r^2 \cot^2 \frac{A}{2}}
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that in a triangle with \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be expressed in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the inradius \( r \) as:
\[
AB \cdot AC = R^2 - 2Rr
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13

Thus, the value of \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. \]

First, we can rewrite the second equation by factoring out the common terms:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b). \]

Using the first equation \( a + b + c = 300 \), we can express \( b + c \), \( a + c \), and \( a + b \) in terms of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ b + c = 300 - a, \]
\[ a + c = 300 - b, \]
\[ a + b = 300 - c. \]

Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[ a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000. \]

Expanding each term, we have:
\[ 300a^2 - a^3 + 300b^2 - b^3 + 300c^2 - c^3 = 6,000,000. \]

Factoring out 300 from the first three terms, we get:
\[ 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000. \]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca). \]

Since \( a + b + c = 300 \), we can rewrite this as:
\[ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca). \]

Rearranging gives:
\[ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) + 3abc. \]

Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[ 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - [300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000. \]

Simplifying inside the brackets, we have:
\[ 300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 300a^2 - 300b^2 - 300c^2 + 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. \]

The \( 300a^2 \), \( 300b^2 \), and \( 300c^2 \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[ 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. \]

Factoring out 300, we get:
\[ 300(ab + bc + ca - abc) = 6,000,000. \]

Dividing both sides by 300, we have:
\[ ab + bc + ca - abc = 20,000. \]

To find a solution, we can assume that \( a = b = c \). If \( a = b = c \), then:
\[ a + a + a = 300 \implies 3a = 300 \implies a = 100. \]

Substituting \( a = b = c = 100 \) into the equation \( ab + bc + ca - abc = 20,000 \), we get:
\[ 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 - 100 \cdot 100 \cdot 100 = 30,000 - 1,000,000 = -970,000. \]

This does not satisfy the equation, so \( a = b = c = 100 \) is not a solution. However, we can try another approach. Let's assume \( a = 100 \), \( b = 100 \), and \( c = 100 \) is a solution to the equation \( ab + bc + ca - abc = 20,000 \). This is not a solution, so we need to find another approach.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) where the perpendicular from the origin \(O\) to the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) intersects \(\overline{AB}\). The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) has endpoints \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).

First, we find the equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\). The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and point \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
The equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we find the equation of the line perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\) that passes through the origin \(O = (0,0)\). The slope of this perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of \(-\sqrt{3}\), which is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\). Using the point-slope form again, we get:
\[
y - 0 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}(x - 0) \implies y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]
The equation of the perpendicular line is:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]

To find the coordinates of the point \(C\), we solve the system of equations:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]
Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Adding \(\sqrt{3}x\) to both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x + \sqrt{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3}x = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Dividing both sides by \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into the equation \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}

Therefore, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

OC^2 = \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{12}{64} = \frac{3}{16}

So, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), and \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

We can factor this expression by considering it as a quadratic in terms of \(\omega^k\):
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 1 + 1 = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1.\]

However, a more useful approach is to use the fact that the 13th roots of unity are the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).\]

The 13th roots of unity, excluding 1, are the roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\). Let \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 13}\). Then \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) are the 13th roots of unity, excluding 1.

We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

Notice that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the product becomes:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

Now, consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of \(P(x)\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

This product can be related to the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) by considering the polynomial \(R(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). The product we need is the value of \(R(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\).

Using the fact that the sum of the roots of \(P(x)\) is \(-1\) (from Vieta's formulas), we can use the polynomial identity for the product of \(R(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\). The product of \(R(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\) is given by:
\[R(\omega) R(\omega^2) \cdots R(\omega^{12}) = P(2) = 13.\]

Therefore, the value of the product is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \(b\) such that the sum of the digits of \(b\) in base \(b\) is equal to \(\sqrt{b^2}\). Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Understand the condition:**
   The condition given is that the sum of the digits of \(b\) in base \(b\) is equal to \(\sqrt{b^2}\). Since \(\sqrt{b^2} = b\), the condition simplifies to the sum of the digits of \(b\) in base \(b\) being equal to \(b\).

2. **Analyze the base \(b\) representation:**
   In base \(b\), the number \(b\) is represented as \(10_b\). The sum of the digits of \(10_b\) is \(1 + 0 = 1\). However, we need this sum to be equal to \(b\). Therefore, \(b\) must be 1, but since \(b \ge 2\), \(b\) cannot be 1. This means there is no base \(b \ge 2\) for which the sum of the digits of \(b\) in base \(b\) is equal to \(b\).

3. **Conclusion:**
   Since there is no base \(b \ge 2\) that satisfies the condition, the problem must be re-evaluated. However, based on the given problem statement and the logical steps, the correct interpretation is that there is no such \(b\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",211,"[211, '211']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the hexagon inscribed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) and compare it to the area of the dodecagon itself.

First, let's denote the side length of the dodecagon by \( s \). The area \( A_{\text{dodecagon}} \) of a regular dodecagon with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[
A_{\text{dodecagon}} = 3s^2 \cot \left( \frac{\pi}{12} \right) = 3s^2 \left( 2 + \sqrt{3} \right)
\]

Next, we consider the inscribed hexagon. A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each with side length equal to the side length of the dodecagon, \( s \). The area \( A_{\text{hexagon}} \) of one equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is:
\[
A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
Therefore, the area of the hexagon is:
\[
A_{\text{hexagon}} = 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
\]

Now, we need to find the ratio of the area of the hexagon to the area of the dodecagon:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{A_{\text{hexagon}}}{A_{\text{dodecagon}}} = \frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2}{3s^2 \left( 2 + \sqrt{3} \right)} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2 + \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2(2 + \sqrt{3})} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}(2 - \sqrt{3})}{2(4 - 3)} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} - 3}{2} = \sqrt{3} - \frac{3}{2}

Thus, the ratio of the area of the hexagon to the area of the dodecagon is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find a 3x3 grid of digits such that the sum of the digits in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. The given sums are 999 and 99, and the maximum digit in the grid is 9. Let's denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
g & h & i \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We know that the sum of the digits in each row, each column, and each diagonal is the same. Let's call this common sum \( S \).

From the problem, we have:
1. The sum of the digits in the first row is 999.
2. The sum of the digits in the second row is 99.
3. The sum of the digits in the third row is 999.
4. The sum of the digits in the first column is 999.
5. The sum of the digits in the second column is 99.
6. The sum of the digits in the third column is 999.
7. The sum of the digits in the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is 999.
8. The sum of the digits in the other diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is 99.

Since the grid is a 3x3 grid of digits, the sum of all the digits in the grid is:
\[
a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i
\]

Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the grid, so the sum of all the digits is:
\[
0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45

However, since the grid is a 3x3 grid of digits, the sum of all the digits is:
\[
0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45

Therefore, the sum of all the digits in the grid is:

"To solve the given problem, we start with the three equations involving logarithms:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

For the third equation, we have:

\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply these three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side of the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

We can combine the powers of 2 on the right side:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Since the left side is 1, we have:

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = 1
\]

This equation is not possible unless the exponent is zero, which it is not. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the product of the logarithms should be zero, which means the product of the arguments should be 1. However, the problem is asking for the value of \( \left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| \).

We can use the properties of logarithms to find \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2 x + 3 \log_2 y + 2 \log_2 z
\]

From the original equations, we can express \( \log_2 x \), \( \log_2 y \), and \( \log_2 z \) in terms of each other. Let \( \log_2 x = a \), \( \log_2 y = b \), and \( \log_2 z = c \). Then we have:

\[
\frac{a}{b + c} = \frac{1}{2} \implies 2a = b + c
\]
\[
\frac{b}{a + c} = \frac{1}{3} \implies 3b = a + c
\]
\[
\frac{c}{a + b} = \frac{1}{4} \implies 4c = a + b
\]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we have \( c = 2a - b \). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
3b = a + (2a - b) \implies 3b = 3a \implies b = a
\]

Substituting \( b = a \) into \( c = 2a - b \), we get:

\[
c = 2a - a = a
\]

So, we have \( b = a \) and \( c = a \). Therefore, \( \log_2 x = \log_2 y = \log_2 z \). Let \( \log_2 x = \log_2 y = \log_2 z = k \). Then:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4k + 3k + 2k = 9k
\]

Since \( \log_2 x = k \), we have \( x = 2^k \). From the first equation \( 2a = b + c \), we have \( 2k = k + k \), which is true. Therefore, \( k \) can be any real number, but the absolute value of \( 9k \) is \( 9 \) when \( k = 1 \).

Thus, the value of \( \left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| \) is \( 9 \), and \( m = 9 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 9 + 1 = 10 \).

10. The sum \( Q + R \) is what we need to find.

From the information provided, we can deduce the following:
- The total number of leh s is equal to the total number of mar kasta, which is equal to the total number of mid ka mid, and all of these are equal to the total number of tirooy Elsa loo beddelo, which is 1.
- The total number of lambarks ka dhasha is 7, which means there are 7 lambarks that are not dhasha.
- The total number of hadhaaga is \( Q \), and the total number of qaybta is \( R \).
- The total number of lagu qaybiyo is 1000, which means the total number of hadhaaga and qaybta combined is 1000.

Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + R = 1000 \]

Since the problem does not provide any additional constraints or specific values for \( Q \) and \( R \), the sum \( Q + R \) is simply the total number of hadhaaga and qaybta combined, which is 1000.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the difference in the radii of the tori \( T \) and \( S \) and then find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction representing this difference in its simplest form.

First, let's identify the radii of the tori:

- The radius of the torus \( T \) is given as \( r_T = 3 \).
