"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of steps and the total time taken for a climber to reach the top of a mountain given different climbing speeds and distances.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( s \) is the number of kilometers the climber climbs per step.
- \( t \) is the total time in minutes the climber spends climbing.
- \( d \) is the total distance in kilometers the climber needs to climb.

The climber's speed in kilometers per step is \( s \) kilometers per step, and the time taken per step is \( \frac{1}{s} \) steps per minute. Therefore, the total time \( t \) in minutes can be expressed as:
\[ t = \frac{d}{s} \]

Given that the climber takes 4 steps and \( t \) minutes when climbing at speed \( s \), we can write:
\[ t = 4 \times \frac{1}{s} = \frac{4}{s} \]

Similarly, when the climber takes \( s+2 \) steps and \( t \) minutes, we can write:
\[ t = (s+2) \times \frac{1}{s} = \frac{s+2}{s} \]

Since both expressions equal \( t \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ \frac{4}{s} = \frac{s+2}{s} \]

To solve for \( s \), we can multiply both sides by \( s \):
\[ 4 = s + 2 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:
\[ s = 2 \]

Now that we know \( s = 2 \), we can find the total distance \( d \) using the equation \( t = \frac{d}{s} \). We know that \( t = \frac{4}{s} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) minutes, so:
\[ d = s \times t = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of steps and the total time taken if the climber takes \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) steps per minute. The time taken per step is:
\[ \frac{1}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ minutes per step} \]

The total time \( t \) in minutes is:
\[ t = \frac{d}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{4}{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{4}{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{5} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of steps taken is:
\[ \frac{d}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{4}{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{4}{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{5} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \text{ steps} \]

The total time taken is:
\[ \boxed{1.6} \] minutes.","[1.60000000000000, '1.6']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), and a circle \(\omega\) that is tangent to \(BC\) at \(D\) and passes through \(B\) and \(C\), we start by finding the length of \(AD\).

First, we use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle \(ABC\). The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]
The area \(K\) of the triangle is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-10)(12-9)(12-5)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
The altitude \(AD\) from vertex \(A\) to side \(BC\) is:
\[
AD = \frac{2K}{BC} = \frac{2 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]

Next, we use the property of the circle \(\omega\) that is tangent to \(BC\) at \(D\) and passes through \(B\) and \(C\). The point \(D\) is the point of tangency, and the power of point \(A\) with respect to the circle \(\omega\) is:
\[
AD^2 = AP \cdot AC
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\left(\frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}\right)^2 = AP \cdot 10
\]
\[
\frac{16 \cdot 14}{9} = AP \cdot 10
\]
\[
\frac{224}{9} = AP \cdot 10
\]
\[
AP = \frac{224}{90} = \frac{112}{45}
\]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{112}{45}\). The sum \(m + n\) where \(AP = \frac{m}{n}\) and \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime is:
\[
m + n = 112 + 45 = 157

\boxed{157}

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the constraints and the nature of the problem. We are given a cube with a side length of 1 unit, and we need to paint the faces of the cube such that each face is painted in one of two colors, red and blue, and no two adjacent faces have the same color. We need to find the number of ways to paint the cube such that it is possible to cut the cube into smaller cubes of side length \(\frac{1}{2}\) and each of these smaller cubes has at least one red face.

First, let's consider the possible colorings of the cube. Since no two adjacent faces can have the same color, there are only two possible colorings for the cube:
1. The top and bottom faces are red, and the four side faces are blue.
2. The top and bottom faces are blue, and the four side faces are red.

In both colorings, each of the smaller cubes of side length \(\frac{1}{2}\) will have at least one red face. This is because each smaller cube will have at least one face that was originally a red face of the larger cube.

Since there are only two possible colorings of the cube, there are exactly 2 ways to paint the cube such that it is possible to cut the cube into smaller cubes of side length \(\frac{1}{2}\) and each of these smaller cubes has at least one red face.

Therefore, the number of ways to paint the cube is 2, and the ratio \(m/n\) is \(2/1\). The sum \(m + n\) is \(2 + 1 = 3\).

"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs of the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the behavior of each function and their intersection points step by step.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( x \geq 0 \) and \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( x < 0 \).
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) if \( x \geq 0 \) and \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{4} \right| \) if \( x < 0 \).

Now, let's consider the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \):
- The function \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of 1.
- The function \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) because \( f(x) \) maps \([-1, 1]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).
- The function \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\) because \( g(x) \) maps \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\).
- Therefore, the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will take values in the range \([0, 1]\).

Next, let's consider the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
- The function \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of \(\frac{2}{3}\).
- The function \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) because \( f(x) \) maps \([-1, 1]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).
- The function \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\) because \( g(x) \) maps \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\).
- Therefore, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will take values in the range \([0, 1]\).

To find the intersection points, we need to solve the equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \). Since both functions take values in the range \([0, 1]\), we need to find the points where the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) intersect within this range.

The function \( f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) is symmetric about \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \), and the function \( g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) is also symmetric about \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \). Therefore, the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will be symmetric about the line \( y = x \).

By analyzing the behavior of the functions and their graphs, we can conclude that the graphs intersect at 4 points. These points are symmetric about the line \( y = x \) and occur at the points where the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are equal.

Therefore, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given condition that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is the smallest prime number. The smallest prime number is 2, so we first check if \( n^4 + 1 \) can be divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

We can rewrite \( n^4 + 1 \) as:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + 1)^2 - 2n^2 = (n^2 + 1 - \sqrt{2}n)(n^2 + 1 + \sqrt{2}n)
\]
However, this form is not useful for divisibility by 4. Instead, we consider the parity of \( n \):
- If \( n \) is even, then \( n^4 \) is even, and \( n^4 + 1 \) is odd, so it cannot be divisible by 4.
- If \( n \) is odd, then \( n^4 \) is odd, and \( n^4 + 1 \) is even. We need to check if \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 4. We can write \( n \) as \( n = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \):
\[
n^4 + 1 = (2k+1)^4 + 1 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 1 + 1 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 2 = 2(8k^4 + 16k^3 + 12k^2 + 4k + 1)
\]
Since \( 8k^4 + 16k^3 + 12k^2 + 4k + 1 \) is an integer, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 2 but not by 4. Therefore, \( p \) cannot be 2.

Next, we consider the next smallest prime number, which is 3. We check if \( n^4 + 1 \) can be divisible by \( 3^2 = 9 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \implies n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{9}
\]
We test the values of \( n \) modulo 9:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 7 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 256 \equiv 4 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 5 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 625 \equiv 4 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 6 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1296 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 7 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 2401 \equiv 7 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 8 \pmod{9} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 4096 \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \).

We see that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{9} \) is not satisfied for any \( n \). Therefore, \( p \) cannot be 3.

Next, we consider the next smallest prime number, which is 5. We check if \( n^4 + 1 \) can be divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \implies n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{25}
\]
We test the values of \( n \) modulo 25:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \).

- If \( n \equiv 12 \pmod{25} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 20736 \equiv 11 \pmod{25} \).

- If \( n \equiv 21 \pmod{25} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 194481 \equiv 6 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 22 \pmod{25} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 234256 \equiv 11 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 23 \pmod{25} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 279841 \equiv 16 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 24 \pmod{25} \), then \( n^4 \equiv 331776 \equiv 21 \pmod{25} \).

We see that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{25} \) is satisfied for \( n \equiv 14 \pmod{25} \). Therefore, \( p = 5 \) is a possible value.

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 25 \). We test the values of \( m \) modulo 25:
- If \( m \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( m \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \( I \) inside the quadrilateral \( ABCD \) such that the distances from \( I \) to each of the vertices \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) are equal. This point \( I \) is the circumcenter of the quadrilateral, and it is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the quadrilateral.

First, let's place the quadrilateral in the coordinate plane. We can assume the following coordinates for the vertices:
- \( A = (0, 0) \)
- \( B = (\sqrt{41}, 0) \)
- \( C = (x, y) \)
- \( D = (x', y') \)

Given the side lengths:
- \( AB = \sqrt{41} \)
- \( AC = \sqrt{80} \)
- \( BD = \sqrt{80} \)
- \( CD = \sqrt{41} \)
- \( BC = \sqrt{89} \)
- \( AD = \sqrt{89} \)

We can use the distance formula to set up equations for the coordinates of \( C \) and \( D \).

For \( C \):
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 80 \]
\[ (x - \sqrt{41})^2 + y^2 = 89 \]

Expanding the second equation:
\[ x^2 - 2\sqrt{41}x + 41 + y^2 = 89 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 - 2\sqrt{41}x + 41 = 89 \]
\[ 80 - 2\sqrt{41}x + 41 = 89 \]
\[ 121 - 2\sqrt{41}x = 89 \]
\[ 32 = 2\sqrt{41}x \]
\[ x = \frac{16}{\sqrt{41}} = \frac{16\sqrt{41}}{41} \]

Substituting \( x \) back into the equation for \( C \):
\[ \left( \frac{16\sqrt{41}}{41} \right)^2 + y^2 = 80 \]
\[ \frac{256 \cdot 41}{1681} + y^2 = 80 \]
\[ \frac{256}{41} + y^2 = 80 \]
\[ y^2 = 80 - \frac{256}{41} \]
\[ y^2 = \frac{3280}{41} - \frac{256}{41} \]
\[ y^2 = \frac{3024}{41} \]
\[ y = \frac{\sqrt{3024}}{\sqrt{41}} = \frac{12\sqrt{21}}{\sqrt{41}} = \frac{12\sqrt{861}}{41} \]

So, the coordinates of \( C \) are:
\[ C = \left( \frac{16\sqrt{41}}{41}, \frac{12\sqrt{861}}{41} \right) \]

For \( D \):
\[ x'^2 + y'^2 = 80 \]
\[ (x' - \sqrt{41})^2 + (y' - \frac{12\sqrt{861}}{41})^2 = 89 \]

Expanding the second equation:
\[ x'^2 - 2\sqrt{41}x' + 41 + y'^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{12\sqrt{861}}{41} y' + \left( \frac{12\sqrt{861}}{41} \right)^2 = 89 \]
\[ x'^2 + y'^2 - 2\sqrt{41}x' - \frac{24\sqrt{861}}{41} y' + 41 + \frac{144 \cdot 861}{1681} = 89 \]
\[ x'^2 + y'^2 - 2\sqrt{41}x' - \frac{24\sqrt{861}}{41} y' + 41 + \frac{123624}{1681} = 89 \]
\[ x'^2 + y'^2 - 2\sqrt{41}x' - \frac{24\sqrt{861}}{41} y' + 41 + 73.5 = 89 \]
\[ x'^2 + y'^2 - 2\sqrt{41}x' - \frac{24\sqrt{861}}{41} y' + 114.5 = 89 \]
\[ x'^2 + y'^2 - 2\sqrt{41}x' - \frac{24\sqrt{861}}{41} y' = -25.5 \]

Since \( D \) is symmetric to \( C \) with respect to the line \( y = \frac{12\sqrt{861}}{41} \), the coordinates of \( D \) are:
\[ D = \left( \frac{16\sqrt{41}}{41}, -\frac{12\sqrt{861}}{41} \right) \]

The circumcenter \( I \) of the quadrilateral is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. The perpendicular bisector of \( AB \) is \( x = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} \). The perpendicular bisector of \( CD \) is \( x = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} \). Therefore, the coordinates of \( I \) are:
\[ I = \left( \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2}, 0 \right) \]

The distance from \( I \) to any vertex is:
\[ \sqrt{\left( \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} - 0 \right)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{41}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} \]

Thus, the distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{41}}{2} \), and \( m = 1 \), \( n = 41 \), \( p = 2 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 1 + 41 + 2 = 44 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular box \(\mathcal{B}\) and then find the radius \(r\) of the inscribed sphere, which is the average of the dimensions of the box. Finally, we will calculate \(r^2\) and express it in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime positive integers, and find \(p+q\).

Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area of the box is given by:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54
\]
The volume of the box is given by:
\[
abc = 23
\]
The radius \(r\) of the inscribed sphere is the average of the dimensions of the box:
\[
r = \frac{a + b + c}{3}
\]
We need to find \(r^2\):
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{a + b + c}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{9}
\]
First, we need to find \(a + b + c\). We can use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We already know that \(ab + bc + ca = 27\) and \(abc = 23\). To find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we can use the identity:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
However, we can also use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]
We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By trial and error or using numerical methods, we find that the roots are approximately \(a \approx 1\), \(b \approx 2\), and \(c \approx 11.5\). However, since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be integers, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct roots are \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 11.5\), but since they are not integers, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct roots are \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 11.5\).

Therefore, the correct value of \(r^2\) is:
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{1 + 2 + 11.5}{3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{14.5}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{210.25}{9} = \frac{841}{36}
\]
Thus, \(p = 841\) and \(q = 36\), and \(p + q = 877\).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(x^{\log_x(y)} = y\). Therefore, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), where \(\log\) is the natural logarithm. Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Next, we apply the property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Similarly, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10\)
2. \(\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10\)

To eliminate the fractions, we multiply the first equation by \(\log(x)\) and the second equation by \(\log(y)\):

1. \(x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)\)
2. \(4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)\)

Next, we solve for \(\log(y)\) in terms of \(\log(x)\) from the first equation:

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

We substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \cdot \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]

Solving for \(y\), we get:

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now we substitute \(y = \frac{25}{x}\) back into the expression for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log\left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Using the property of logarithms that states \(\log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log(a) - \log(b)\), we have:

\[
\log(25) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(25) = 2 \log(5)\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we multiply every term by \(x\):

\[
2x \log(5) - x \log(x) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
2x \log(5) = x \log(x) + 10 \log(x)
\]

Factoring out \(\log(x)\) on the right-hand side, we have:

\[
2x \log(5) = (x + 10) \log(x)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\), we get:

\[
2x \log(5) = x + 10
\]

Rearranging terms, we have a quadratic equation:

\[
2x \log(5) - x - 10 = 0
\]

Factoring out \(x\), we get:

\[
x(2 \log(5) - 1) = 10
\]

Solving for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = \frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}
\]

Now we substitute \(x = \frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}\) back into the expression for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{25}{\frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}} = \frac{25(2 \log(5) - 1)}{10} = \frac{5(2 \log(5) - 1)}{2} = \frac{10 \log(5) - 5}{2} = 5 \log(5) - \frac{5}{2}
\]

Finally, we find \(xy\):

\[
xy = \left(\frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}\right) \left(5 \log(5) - \frac{5}{2}\right)
\]

To simplify, we note that \(5 \log(5) - \frac{5}{2} = \frac{10 \log(5) - 5}{2}\), so:

\[
xy = \left(\frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}\right) \left(\frac{10 \log(5) - 5}{2}\right) = \frac{10(10 \log(5) - 5)}{2(2 \log(5) - 1)} = \frac{5(10 \log(5) - 5)}{2 \log(5) - 1} = 5 \cdot 5 = 25

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the smallest \( n \) such that there exists a sequence of \( n \) moves where the number of moves is at most 2024, and the final number of tokens is 1, starting with \( n \) tokens and ensuring that the number of tokens after each move is either 1, 4, or \( n \) (where \( n \) is the initial number of tokens).

We start by analyzing the possible moves:
1. If the current number of tokens is \( k \), the next number of tokens can be \( k-1 \), \( k+3 \), or \( k \) (since \( k \) is the initial number of tokens and the final number of tokens is 1).

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that we can reach 1 from \( n \) in at most 2024 moves. Let's consider the sequence of moves:
- If the current number of tokens is \( n \), the next number of tokens can be \( n-1 \), \( n+3 \), or \( n \).
- If the current number of tokens is \( n-1 \), the next number of tokens can be \( n-2 \), \( n+2 \), or \( n-1 \).
- If the current number of tokens is \( n+3 \), the next number of tokens can be \( n+2 \), \( n+6 \), or \( n+3 \).

To minimize the number of moves, we should try to reduce the number of tokens by 1 in each move. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to always move to \( n-1 \) if possible.

Let's denote the number of moves required to reduce the number of tokens from \( n \) to 1 as \( f(n) \). We have:
\[ f(n) = n-1 \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( f(n) \leq 2024 \):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen 4-digit number formed from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \) contains at least one pair of consecutive digits that are the same. We will then express this probability in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, and find \(m+n\).

First, let's calculate the total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed from the set \( S \). Since the digits can be repeated, there are \(10\) choices for each of the four positions in the number. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit numbers is:
\[
10^4 = 10000
\]

Next, we need to count the number of 4-digit numbers that do not contain any pair of consecutive digits that are the same. For the first digit, there are 10 choices. For each subsequent digit, there are 9 choices (since it cannot be the same as the previous digit). Therefore, the number of 4-digit numbers that do not contain any pair of consecutive digits that are the same is:
\[
10 \times 9 \times 9 \times 9 = 7290
\]

The number of 4-digit numbers that contain at least one pair of consecutive digits that are the same is the total number of 4-digit numbers minus the number of 4-digit numbers that do not contain any pair of consecutive digits that are the same:
\[
10000 - 7290 = 2710
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen 4-digit number contains at least one pair of consecutive digits that are the same is:
\[
\frac{2710}{10000} = \frac{271}{1000}
\]

Since 271 and 1000 are coprime, the fraction \(\frac{271}{1000}\) is in its simplest form. Therefore, \(m = 271\) and \(n = 1000\), and the sum \(m+n\) is:

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to analyze the properties of the rectangles and the circle.

First, let's denote the coordinates of the points:
- \(A = (0, 0)\)
- \(B = (107, 0)\)
- \(C = (107, 16)\)
- \(D = (0, 16)\)

Since \(D, E, C\) are collinear, \(E\) must lie on the line \(x = 107\). Let \(E = (107, y)\).

Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic. The center of the circle passing through \(A, D, H, G\) is the midpoint of the hypotenuse \(AG\) of the right triangle \(ADH\). However, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral bisect each other. Therefore, the midpoint of \(AG\) is also the midpoint of \(DH\).

The midpoint of \(AD\) is \((53.5, 8)\). Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the midpoint of \(AG\) must be the same as the midpoint of \(DH\). This implies that \(H\) and \(G\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(y = 8\).

Now, let's consider the rectangle \(EFGH\). Since \(E\) is on the line \(x = 107\), \(F\) must be on the line \(y = 16\). Let \(F = (107, 16)\). Since \(E, F, G, H\) are concyclic, the quadrilateral \(EFGH\) is cyclic. The center of the circle passing through \(E, F, G, H\) is the midpoint of the hypotenuse \(EG\) of the right triangle \(EFG\).

The length of \(EF\) is given as 184. Since \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same vertical line, the length of \(EF\) is the difference in their \(y\)-coordinates:
\[ |y - 16| = 184 \]
This gives us two possible values for \(y\):
\[ y = 200 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -168 \]

Since \(E\) is above \(D\) and \(D\) is at \(y = 16\), \(E\) must be at \(y = 200\). Therefore, \(E = (107, 200)\).

Now, we need to find the length of \(CE\). The coordinates of \(C\) are \((107, 16)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((107, 200)\). The distance between \(C\) and \(E\) is:
\[ CE = |200 - 16| = 184 \]

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Movement**: The rook moves from the leftmost column to the rightmost column and then back to the leftmost column. This means it moves 8 rows to the right and then 8 rows to the left, making a total of 16 moves. The rook changes direction 4 times, which means it changes direction after every 4 moves.

2. **Identifying the Rows Covered**: Each time the rook changes direction, it must have covered a complete row. Since the rook changes direction 4 times, it must have covered 4 complete rows.

"To find the maximum value of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)

Expanding both terms, we have:

The magnitude of this complex number is:

\[

Calculating the constants, we get:

\[

Substituting these values back into the expression, we get:

\[
\sqrt{324000\cos^2\theta + 309520\sin^2\theta + 2 \cdot 16896 \cos\theta \cdot \sin\theta}

To maximize this expression, we need to consider the maximum value of the trigonometric terms. The maximum value of \(324000\cos^2\theta + 309520\sin^2\theta + 2 \cdot 16896 \cos\theta \cdot \sin\theta\) is the sum of the magnitudes of the individual terms when they are in phase.

The radii of these circles form a geometric sequence where each term is the inradius of a smaller triangle formed by the tangents to the incircle and the sides of the original triangle.

The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given by the equations \(y = \pm \frac{b}{a} x = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. The lengths of the diagonals can be found using the properties of the hyperbola. The length of the transverse axis (which is the distance between the vertices) is \(2a = 4\sqrt{5}\), and the length of the conjugate axis (which is the distance between the co-vertices) is \(2b = 4\sqrt{6}\).

For a parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals. However, we are interested in the length of one of the diagonals, \(BD\), and we need to find the minimum value of \(BD^2\).

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of the endpoints \(B\) and \(D\). Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, if \(B = (x_1, y_1)\) and \(D = (-x_1, -y_1)\), then \(BD^2 = (x_1 - (-x_1))^2 + (y_1 - (-y_1))^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\).

The points \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, so they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). To minimize \(BD^2\), we need to minimize \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\). From the hyperbola equation, we can express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):
\[y_1^2 = \frac{24}{20} x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5} x_1^2 - 24.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to find the minimum value of \(\frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24\). Since \(x_1^2 \geq 20\) (because \(x_1\) is the x-coordinate of a point on the hyperbola), the minimum value of \(\frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24\) occurs when \(x_1^2 = 20\):
\[\frac{11}{5} \cdot 20 - 24 = 44 - 24 = 20.\]

- The number of raiements with an umbrella, a notebook, a pen, and a book is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = x \).

We need to find the number of raiements that have all four items, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \). We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets to find the number of raiements that have at least one of the four items:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

We know that the number of raiements that have at least one of the four items is at most the total number of raiements, so:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| \leq 900
\]

Substituting the given values into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - 120 - 150 - 100 - 180 - 130 - 200 + 50 + 40 + 30 + 25 - x
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 1281 - 1180 + 145 - x = 246 - x
\]

Since \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| \leq 900 \), we have:

\[
246 - x \leq 900
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
246 - 900 \leq x \implies -654 \leq x \implies x \geq -654
\]

However, since \( x \) represents the number of raiements that have all four items, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the only valid solution is:

\[
x = 0
\]

Thus, the number of raiements that have all four items is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",73,"[73, '73']",False
"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) has a circumcircle with center \( O \) and an incircle with center \( I \), and that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \), we need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( I \) lies on the circle with diameter \( \overline{OA} \). The radius of this circle is \( \frac{R}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \). The distance from \( I \) to \( A \) is the inradius \( r = 6 \), which is less than \( \frac{13}{2} \), so \( I \) is inside the circumcircle.

Next, we use the fact that the area \( \Delta \) of \( \triangle ABC \) can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s
\]
The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area:
\[
r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Substituting \( r = 6 \) and \( R = 13 \):
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
Thus,
\[
abc = 312s
\]

We also use the identity for the product of the sides of a triangle in terms of the circumradius and the angles:

"To find the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the second equation. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing through by 3, we get:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.
\]

To find possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we can test some simple cases. Let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:

\[
100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6 \cdot 1,000,000 = 6,000,000.
\]

Thus, \((100, 100, 100)\) is a solution. Now, we need to determine if there are any other solutions. Suppose \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are not all equal. Without loss of generality, assume \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we have \(c \geq 100\). Also, since \(abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000\), \(abc\) must be less than \(100(ab + bc + ca)\).

Let's consider the case where \(a = 0\). Then \(b + c = 300\) and the second equation becomes:

\[
0 + 0 + bc(0 + 0 + 0) = 0 \neq -2,000,000.
\]

So, \(a \neq 0\). Next, let's consider the case where \(a = 1\). Then \(b + c = 299\) and the second equation becomes:

\[
bc - 100(b + c) = -2,000,000 \implies bc - 29,900 = -2,000,000 \implies bc = -1,970,100.
\]

Since \(bc\) must be a positive integer, there are no solutions in this case. Similarly, for \(a = 2, 3, \ldots, 99\), the product \(bc\) will be negative, so there are no solutions.

Finally, let's consider the case where \(a = 100\). Then \(b + c = 200\) and the second equation becomes:

\[
100bc - 100(100b + 100c) = -2,000,000 \implies 100bc - 10,000(b + c) = -2,000,000 \implies bc - 100(b + c) = -20,000.
\]

This is the same equation as before, so the only solution is \(b = 100\) and \(c = 100\). Therefore, the only solution is \((100, 100, 100)\).

Thus, the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that the circle centered at \(C\) with radius 1 is tangent to \(\overline{AB}\) and does not contain any points of \(\overline{AB}\) other than \(C\). Then, we need to find the value of \(OC^2\) and express it in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime positive integers. Finally, we will find \(p+q\).

First, let's find the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The points \(A\) and \(B\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\), respectively. The slope of the line \(AB\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, the equation of the line \(AB\) is:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, let's denote the coordinates of point \(C\) as \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) lies on the line \(AB\), we have:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

The distance from the point \(C\) to the line \(AB\) is the radius of the circle, which is 1. The formula for the distance from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(ax + by + c = 0\) is:
\[
\text{distance} = \frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}
\]
For the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
\]
So, the distance from \(C\) to the line is:
\[
\frac{|\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|}{\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|}{2}
\]
Setting this equal to 1, we get:
\[
\frac{|\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|}{2} = 1 \implies |\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}| = 2
\]
Since \(C\) is the point of tangency and does not contain any points of \(\overline{AB}\) other than \(C\), we take the positive value:
\[
\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2
\]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\sqrt{3}x + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 \implies 0 = 2
\]
This is a contradiction, so we take the negative value:
\[
\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2
\]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\sqrt{3}x + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2 \implies 0 = -2
\]
This is also a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to find the point \(C\) such that the circle is tangent to the line and does not contain any points of \(\overline{AB}\) other than \(C\). This point is the foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the line \(AB\).

The foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the line \(ax + by + c = 0\) is:
\[
\left(-\frac{a}{a^2 + b^2}c, -\frac{b}{a^2 + b^2}c\right)
\]
For the line \(\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0\), the foot of the perpendicular is:
\[
\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right), -\frac{1}{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\right) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)
\]
So, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\).

Finally, we find \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{6}{16} = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Thus, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 8\), and \(p + q = 3 + 8 = 11\).

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the polynomial \( P(x) = x^{13} - 1 \).

This means that \( \omega^{13} = 1 \) and \( \omega^k \neq 1 \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \).

We need to evaluate the expression \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \). To do this, we consider the polynomial \( Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 \). We need to find the product of \( Q(\omega^k) \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \).

First, we note that \( Q(x) \) can be rewritten as:
\[ Q(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1. \]

We need to evaluate:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 \right). \]

To simplify this, we consider the polynomial \( R(x) = x^{13} - 1 \) and its roots. The polynomial \( R(x) \) can be factored as:
\[ R(x) = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1). \]

The roots of \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0 \) are the 13th roots of unity except 1, i.e., \( \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12} \).

We need to find the value of:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 \right). \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 \right) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left( \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 \right). \]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 \) evaluated at \( x = \omega^k \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \) is 0, and the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 \) evaluated at \( x = 1 \) is 0. Therefore, the product of \( Q(\omega^k) \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12 \) is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \( (x-1)^{13} - 1 \) divided by the constant term of the polynomial \( x^{13} - 1 \), which is 1.

Thus, the product is:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left( (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1 \right) = 1. \]

Therefore, the remainder when this product is divided by 1000 is:

"To determine the smallest number of integers \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are many \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the conditions under which a number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it can be expressed as a sum of two digits in base \( b \) and this sum is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a \( b \)-beautiful number, then \( n \) can be written as \( ab + c \) where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) (i.e., \( 0 \le a, c < b \)) and \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits, the maximum value of \( a + c \) is \( b-1 + b-1 = 2b-2 \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{n} \le 2b-2 \), which implies \( n \le (2b-2)^2 \).

Now, let's consider the range of \( n \) for a given \( b \). The number \( n \) must be a perfect square and must be expressible as \( ab + c \) where \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). The number of such \( n \) is limited by the number of possible values for \( \sqrt{n} \), which is \( b-1 \) (since \( \sqrt{n} \) can be any integer from 2 to \( b-1 \)).

For \( b = 4 \), the possible values for \( \sqrt{n} \) are 2, 3, and 4, so \( n = 4 \), \( n = 9 \), or \( n = 16 \). As \( b \) increases, the number of possible values for \( \sqrt{n} \) increases, and the number of \( b \)-beautiful numbers increases.

As \( b \) increases, the number of possible values for \( \sqrt{n} \) increases, and the number of \( b \)-beautiful numbers increases.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct rectangles that can be formed by drawing lines through the vertices and diagonals of a regular 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) such that each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle formed by drawing lines through these vertices and diagonals must have its sides parallel to the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. This means that the vertices of the rectangle must be of the form \( A_i, A_{i+k}, A_{i+2k}, A_{i+3k} \) for some integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 6 \) (since \( k = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \) would just repeat the same rectangles in a different order).

For each \( k \), there is exactly one rectangle that can be formed. Therefore, there are 6 distinct rectangles that can be formed.

The problem states that three of these rectangles are already drawn. Since there are 6 distinct rectangles in total, the number of distinct rectangles that are not drawn is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \).

Thus, the number of distinct rectangles that are not drawn is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",315,"[315, '315']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list that meets the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions step by step:

1. The sum of the numbers in the list is 30.
2. The mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive number that is not in the list.

Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. The median is a positive number that is not in the list, which means the list must have an odd number of elements and the median will be the middle number.

Let's start by considering the smallest possible list that meets these conditions. Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear at least twice. Let's assume the list has 5 elements (the smallest odd number greater than 3, since the median is the middle number in a list of 5 elements).

Let's denote the numbers in the grid as follows:

"To solve the given problem, we start with the three equations involving logarithms:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We can rewrite these equations in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) by using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b\left(\frac{a}{c}\right) = \log_b a - \log_b c\):

\[
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2 y - \log_2 x - \log_2 z = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2 z - \log_2 x - \log_2 y = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let's denote \(\log_2 x = a\), \(\log_2 y = b\), and \(\log_2 z = c\). Then the system of equations becomes:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We can add all three equations together to eliminate \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
a - b - c + b - a - c + c - a - b = -a - b - c
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

To add the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]

Adding these fractions, we get:

\[
\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So the equation is:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now we need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b (a^c) = c \log_b a\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We already know that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\). To find \(4a + 3b + 2c\), we can use the fact that:

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 3(a + b + c) + a - b - c
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 3\left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{39}{12} + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{39}{12} + \frac{6}{12} = -\frac{33}{12} = -\frac{11}{4}
\]

Therefore, \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{11}{4}\), and the absolute value is:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \left|-\frac{11}{4}\right| = \frac{11}{4}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{11}{4}\) is already in its simplest form, so \(m = 11\) and \(n = 4\). Thus, \(m + n = 11 + 4 = 15\).

"Given that \(ABCDEF\) is a regular hexagon with all opposite sides parallel, and the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are extended to form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300, we need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). In a regular hexagon, the distance between two opposite sides is equal to the side length of the hexagon. When the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are extended, they form a triangle where the sides of the triangle are parallel to the sides of the hexagon but extended by the side length \(s\) of the hexagon.

The side lengths of the triangle formed by extending the sides of the hexagon are:
- \(AB + 2s = s + 2s = 3s\)
- \(CD + 2s = s + 2s = 3s\)
- \(EF + 2s = s + 2s = 3s\)

However, the side lengths given in the problem are 200, 240, and 300. This means that the side lengths of the triangle are not simply \(3s\), but rather the sides of the triangle are formed by extending the sides of the hexagon by different amounts. Let's denote the extensions by \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) such that:
- \(AB + x = 200\)
- \(CD + y = 240\)
- \(EF + z = 300\)

Since \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are the extensions of the sides of the hexagon, they must be equal to the side length \(s\) of the hexagon. Therefore, we have:
- \(s + x = 200\)
- \(s + y = 240\)
- \(s + z = 300\)

We can solve these equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
- \(x = 200 - s\)
- \(y = 240 - s\)
- \(z = 300 - s\)

Since \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are the extensions of the sides of the hexagon, they must be equal to the side length \(s\) of the hexagon. Therefore, we have:
- \(s = 200 - s\)
- \(s = 240 - s\)
- \(s = 300 - s\)

We can solve these equations for \(s\):
- \(2s = 200\)
- \(2s = 240\)
- \(2s = 300\)

The correct solution is:
- \(s = 200\)

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the conditions given and then apply them step by step.

1. **Identify the sets and their properties:**
   - Set \( A \) is a positive set, meaning it contains only positive integers.
   - Set \( B \) is a non-empty set of integers such that every element of \( B \) is also an element of \( A \). This means \( B \subseteq A \).
   - Set \( B \) has 2024 elements.

2. **Determine the number of elements in set \( A \):**
   - Since \( B \subseteq A \) and \( B \) has 2024 elements, the number of elements in \( A \) must be at least 2024.
   - However, the problem does not provide any additional information about the elements of \( A \) or any constraints that would suggest \( A \) has more than 2024 elements. Therefore, the minimum number of elements in \( A \) is 2024.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of elements in set \( A \) is at least 2024. Since the problem asks for the number of elements in \( A \) and does not provide any further constraints, the answer is the minimum possible number of elements in \( A \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest positive integer \( N \) such that \( N \) is divisible by 7 when reduced modulo any of its digits, and then find the sum of the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

First, let's consider the properties of \( N \). Since \( N \) is divisible by 7 when reduced modulo any of its digits, \( N \) must be a multiple of 7. Additionally, \( N \) must be a 4-digit number, and the largest 4-digit number is 9999. We need to find the largest 4-digit multiple of 7 that satisfies the given condition.

Let's start by checking the largest 4-digit number, 9999:
- The digits of 9999 are 9, 9, 9, and 9.
- We need to check if 9999 is divisible by 7 when reduced modulo 9. The remainder when 9999 is divided by 9 is the same as the remainder when the sum of its digits is divided by 9. The sum of the digits of 9999 is \( 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 \), and the remainder when 36 is divided by 9 is 0. Therefore, 9999 is divisible by 7 when reduced modulo 9.

Since 9999 satisfies the condition, it is the largest 4-digit number that meets the criteria. Now, we need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when 9999 is divided by 1000:
- The quotient \( Q \) is the integer part of \( \frac{9999}{1000} \), which is 9.
- The remainder \( R \) is the remainder when 9999 is divided by 1000, which is 999.

Therefore, the sum \( Q + R \) is:
\[ Q + R = 9 + 999 = 1008 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1008}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the difference between the radii of the two circles \( T \) and \( S \) and express it in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers. Then, we will find \( m + n \).

First, let's identify the given information:
- Circle \( T \) has a radius of 3 and is centered at a point \( (a, b) \) such that the distance from the center to the center of circle \( S \) is 6. This means the radius of circle \( S \) is 11.
- Circle \( S \) is centered at the origin \( (0, 0) \).

The distance from the center of circle \( T \) to the origin is 6, so we have:
\[ \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 6 \]

Since the radius of circle \( T \) is 3, the distance from the center of circle \( T \) to the point of tangency on circle \( S \) is \( 11 - 3 = 8 \). This distance is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being the distance from the center of circle \( T \) to the origin (which is 6) and the other leg being the radius of circle \( T \) (which is 3). Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the coordinates of the center of circle \( T \).

However, we don't need the exact coordinates of the center of circle \( T \) to find the radii of the circles at the point of tangency. We can use the fact that the distance from the center of circle \( T \) to the point of tangency on circle \( S \) is 8, and the radius of circle \( S \) is 11.

The radius \( r_i \) of circle \( T \) at the point of tangency on circle \( S \) is the distance from the center of circle \( T \) to the point of tangency minus the radius of circle \( T \):
\[ r_i = 8 - 3 = 5 \]

The radius \( r_o \) of circle \( S \) at the point of tangency on circle \( T \) is the distance from the center of circle \( S \) to the point of tangency minus the radius of circle \( S \):
\[ r_o = 8 - 11 = -3 \]

The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 5 - (-3) = 8 \]

Thus, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) is \( \frac{8}{1} \), where \( m = 8 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 8 + 1 = 9 \).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 25 non-mismatched blue cubes and 25 non-mismatched red cubes in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that the following conditions are met:

1. Each row and each column contains at least one blue cube and at least one red cube.
2. There is exactly one row and one column that contain only blue cubes.
3. There is exactly one row and one column that contain only red cubes.
4. The remaining 3 rows and 3 columns each contain at least one cube of both colors.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Choose the rows and columns for the single blue and single red cubes:**
   - There are 5 choices for the row that contains only blue cubes.
   - There are 5 choices for the column that contains only blue cubes.
   - There are 5 choices for the row that contains only red cubes.
   - There are 5 choices for the column that contains only red cubes.

   The total number of ways to choose these rows and columns is:
   \[
   5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625
   \]

2. **Arrange the cubes in the remaining 3 rows and 3 columns:**
   - After choosing the rows and columns for the single blue and single red cubes, we have a \(3 \times 3\) grid where each row and each column must contain at least one blue cube and at least one red cube.
   - This is equivalent to finding the number of \(3 \times 3\) binary matrices (where 1 represents a blue cube and 0 represents a red cube) such that no row or column is all 0s or all 1s.

   The number of \(3 \times 3\) binary matrices is \(2^{9} = 512\). We need to subtract the number of matrices that have at least one row or column of all 0s or all 1s.

   - There are \(2\) matrices with all 0s and \(2\) matrices with all 1s.
   - There are \(6\) matrices with one row of all 0s (3 choices for the row and 2 choices for the column) and \(6\) matrices with one row of all 1s (3 choices for the row and 2 choices for the column).
   - There are \(6\) matrices with one column of all 0s (3 choices for the column and 2 choices for the row) and \(6\) matrices with one column of all 1s (3 choices for the column and 2 choices for the row).
   - There are \(2\) matrices with one row and one column of all 0s (3 choices for the row and 3 choices for the column) and \(2\) matrices with one row and one column of all 1s (3 choices for the row and 3 choices for the column).
   - There are \(2\) matrices with two rows of all 0s (3 choices for the row and 2 choices for the row) and \(2\) matrices with two rows of all 1s (3 choices for the row and 2 choices for the row).
   - There are \(2\) matrices with two columns of all 0s (3 choices for the column and 2 choices for the column) and \(2\) matrices with two columns of all 1s (3 choices for the column and 2 choices for the column).
   - There is \(1\) matrix with all 0s and all 1s (the matrix with all 0s and the matrix with all 1s).

   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of matrices that have at least one row or column of all 0s or all 1s is:
   \[
   2 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 + 1 = 15
   \]

   Therefore, the number of \(3 \times 3\) binary matrices where each row and each column contains at least one blue cube and at least one red cube is:
   \[
   512 - 15 = 497
   \]

3. **Combine the choices:**
   - The total number of ways to arrange the cubes is the product of the number of ways to choose the rows and columns and the number of ways to arrange the cubes in the remaining \(3 \times 3\) grid:
   \[
   625 \times 497 = 310625
   \]

Thus, the number of ways to arrange the cubes is \(\boxed{310625}\).","[310625, '310625']",902,"[902, '902']",False
