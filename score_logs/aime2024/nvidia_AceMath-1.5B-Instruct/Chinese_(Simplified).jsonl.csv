"To solve the problem, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the given information. Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - \( s \) is the speed in miles per hour.
   - \( t \) is the time in minutes spent walking in the coffee shop.

2. **Convert the time spent walking into hours:**
   - When walking at speed \( s \), the time spent walking is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours.
   - When walking at speed \( s+2 \), the time spent walking is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours.
   - When walking at speed \( s+\frac{1}{2} \), the time spent walking is \( \frac{9}{s+\frac{1}{2}} \) hours.

3. **Set up the equations based on the total time spent:**
   - When walking at speed \( s \), the total time is \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \) hours.
   - When walking at speed \( s+2 \), the total time is \( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = \frac{14}{5} \) hours (since 2 hours 24 minutes is \( \frac{14}{5} \) hours).

4. **Eliminate \( t \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 4 - \frac{14}{5}
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = \frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} = \frac{18}{s(s+2)}
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   4 - \frac{14}{5} = \frac{20}{5} - \frac{14}{5} = \frac{6}{5}
   \]
   So we have:
   \[
   \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = \frac{6}{5}
   \]
   Cross-multiply to solve for \( s \):
   \[
   90 = 6s(s+2)
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   15 = s(s+2)
   \]
   \[
   s^2 + 2s - 15 = 0
   \]
   Factor the quadratic equation:
   \[
   (s+5)(s-3) = 0
   \]
   So the solutions are \( s = -5 \) (which is not physically meaningful for speed) and \( s = 3 \). Therefore, \( s = 3 \) miles per hour.

5. **Find the time \( t \) spent walking:**
   Substitute \( s = 3 \) into the first equation:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{t}{60} = 1
   \]
   \[
   t = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time spent walking at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \):**
   When walking at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 + \frac{1}{2} = 3.5 \) miles per hour, the time spent walking is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3.5} = \frac{9}{\frac{7}{2}} = \frac{18}{7} \text{ hours}
   \]
   Convert this time into minutes:
   \[
   \frac{18}{7} \times 60 = \frac{1080}{7} \approx 154.2857 \text{ minutes}
   \]

7. **Find the total time spent walking including the time spent in the coffee shop:**
   When walking at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \), the total time is:
   \[
   \frac{18}{7} + 60 = \frac{18}{7} + \frac{420}{7} = \frac{438}{7} \approx 62.5714 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total time spent walking including the time spent in the coffee shop is \(\boxed{62.5714}\) minutes.","[62.5714000000000, '62.5714']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we start by finding the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):

\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]

Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area \(K\) of the triangle:

\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]

The area of the triangle can also be expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h
\]

where \(h\) is the altitude from vertex \(A\) to side \(BC\). Solving for \(h\):

\[
6\sqrt{14} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times h \implies h = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]

The length \(AP\) is the distance from vertex \(A\) to the point \(P\) where the line \(AD\) intersects the circumcircle again. By the Power of a Point theorem, we have:

\[
AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC
\]

First, we need to find \(AD\). The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle:

\[
AD = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that \(AD\) is the length of the tangent from \(A\) to the point of tangency on \(BC\), which is equal to the length of the tangent from \(A\) to the point of tangency on the circumcircle. Therefore, we have:

\[
AD = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Now, we can find \(AP\):

\[
AP \cdot 5\sqrt{2} = 5 \cdot 10 \implies AP = \frac{50}{5\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

However, we need to express \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). We know that:

\[
AP = \frac{50}{5\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the correct form is:

\[
AP = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon, with each vertex independently colored either red or blue with equal probability, can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices.

First, let's consider the possible colorings of the octagon. There are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings since each of the 8 vertices can be either red or blue.

A key insight is that the problem is invariant under rotation. Therefore, we can fix one vertex to be red without loss of generality. This reduces the problem to finding the number of valid colorings of the remaining 7 vertices such that the total number of blue vertices is even (since the total number of blue vertices must be even for the octagon to be rotationally symmetric with all blue vertices in the original red positions).

Let's denote the number of blue vertices in the octagon by \(k\). Since we fixed one vertex to be red, \(k\) must be even. The number of ways to choose \(k\) blue vertices out of 7 vertices is \(\binom{7}{k}\).

The total number of valid colorings is the sum of \(\binom{7}{k}\) for all even \(k\):
\[
\binom{7}{0} + \binom{7}{2} + \binom{7}{4} + \binom{7}{6}
\]

Using the binomial theorem, we know that:
\[
\binom{7}{0} + \binom{7}{1} + \binom{7}{2} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{4} + \binom{7}{5} + \binom{7}{6} + \binom{7}{7} = 2^7 = 128
\]
and
\[
\binom{7}{0} + \binom{7}{2} + \binom{7}{4} + \binom{7}{6} = \binom{7}{1} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{7}{5} + \binom{7}{7} = 128
\]

Since the sum of the binomial coefficients for even \(k\) is equal to the sum of the binomial coefficients for odd \(k\), we have:
\[
\binom{7}{0} + \binom{7}{2} + \binom{7}{4} + \binom{7}{6} = 64
\]

Therefore, the number of valid colorings is 64. The probability that a randomly chosen coloring is valid is:
\[
\frac{64}{256} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices is \(\frac{1}{4}\). In this fraction, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 4\), so \(m + n = 1 + 4 = 5\).

"To find the number of intersection points of the curves \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f \) and \( g \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions \( f \) and \( g \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \( f \) and \( g \):
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
  - If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
  - If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, we need to evaluate \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

Next, we need to find the values of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):
- \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).
- \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).

To find the intersection points, we need to solve:
\[ 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]
\[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Since \( g \) is a piecewise linear function, we need to consider the points where \( g \) changes its form:
- \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \) for \( x \in [0, \frac{1}{4}] \)
- \( g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \) for \( x \in [\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}] \)

We need to find the points where \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) map to the same value in the range \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).

By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the functions \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \), we can determine that there are 12 intersection points in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Therefore, the number of intersection points is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, it is more useful to consider the factorization over the integers modulo a prime \( p \).

We need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists an integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \), so the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be 8. Therefore, 8 must divide \( \phi(p^2) = p(p-1) \).

Let's check the smallest primes:

1. For \( p = 2 \):
   \[
   \phi(4) = 2 \quad \text{(which is not divisible by 8)}.
   \]
   So, \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

2. For \( p = 3 \):
   \[
   \phi(9) = 6 \quad \text{(which is not divisible by 8)}.
   \]
   So, \( p = 3 \) is not a solution.

3. For \( p = 5 \):
   \[
   \phi(25) = 20 \quad \text{(which is divisible by 8)}.
   \]
   So, \( p = 5 \) is a solution.

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \). We already know that \( n = 2 \) is a solution to \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \):
\[
2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
\]
So, \( n = 2 \) is not a solution. Let's check \( n = 3 \):
\[
3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
\]
So, \( n = 3 \) is not a solution. Let's check \( n = 4 \):
\[
4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
\]
So, \( n = 4 \) is not a solution. Let's check \( n = 6 \):
\[
6^4 + 1 = 1296 + 1 = 1297 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
\]
So, \( n = 6 \) is not a solution. Let's check \( n = 7 \):
\[
7^4 + 1 = 2401 + 1 = 2402 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
\]
So, \( n = 7 \) is a solution.

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \) is \( \boxed{7} \).","[7, '7']",110,"[110, '110']",False
"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) to each face of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \), we first need to determine the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron and the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The distance \( r \) from the incenter to each face is given by the formula:

\[ r = \frac{3V}{S} \]

First, we calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with vertices \( A, B, C, D \) and edge lengths \( AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f \) is given by:

\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41}, b = \sqrt{80}, c = \sqrt{89}, d = \sqrt{41}, e = \sqrt{80}, f = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 41 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 41 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[ 288 V^2 = -288 \cdot 41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 \]

Thus,

\[ V^2 = 41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ V = \sqrt{41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89} = \sqrt{41 \cdot 16 \cdot 5 \cdot 89} = 4 \sqrt{41 \cdot 5 \cdot 89} = 4 \sqrt{18305} \]

Next, we calculate the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is an isosceles triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41}, \sqrt{80}, \sqrt{89} \). The area of one such triangle can be found using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle is:

\[ s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the triangle is:

\[ A = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})} \]

However, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a, b, c \) is given by:

\[ A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)} \]

Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41}, b = \sqrt{80}, c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[ A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24 \sqrt{21} = 6 \sqrt{21} \]

Since there are four faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:

\[ S = 4 \cdot 6 \sqrt{21} = 24 \sqrt{21} \]

Finally, the distance \( r \) from the incenter to each face is:

\[ r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \cdot 4 \sqrt{18305}}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{\sqrt{18305}}{2 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{\sqrt{18305 \cdot 21}}{42} = \frac{\sqrt{384405}}{42} = \frac{61 \sqrt{95}}{42} \]

Thus, \( m = 61 \), \( n = 95 \), and \( p = 42 \). The sum \( m + n + p \) is:

\[ m + n + p = 61 + 95 + 42 = 198 \]

"To find the minimum radius \( r \) of the sphere that can contain all the longitudes in the set \(\mathcal{B}\), we need to consider the properties of the longitudes in \(\mathcal{B}\). Each longitude is a rectangular prism with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Let the dimensions of a longitude be \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). Then, we have the following equations:

\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \quad \text{(Surface area)}
\]
\[
abc = 23 \quad \text{(Volume)}
\]

The diagonal \( d \) of the rectangular prism is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

The minimum radius \( r \) of the sphere that can contain the longitudes is half of the diagonal \( d \):

\[
r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}
\]

To find \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \), we use the identity:

\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]

From the surface area equation, we have \( ab + bc + ca = 27 \). Therefore:

\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54
\]

We also know that:

\[
(a + b + c)^2 \geq 3(ab + bc + ca) = 81
\]

Thus:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq 27

To find the exact value of \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \), we use the fact that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the roots of the polynomial:

\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]

We need to find the minimum value of \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) under the constraint \( 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \) and \( abc = 23 \). By symmetry and the nature of the problem, we can assume that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are close to each other. Let's test the values \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 23 \):

Let's test the values \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = \frac{23}{2} \):

\[
2(1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot \frac{23}{2} + \frac{23}{2} \cdot 1) = 2(2 + 23 + \frac{23}{2}) = 2 \cdot \frac{75}{2} = 75 \quad \text{(not 54)}
\]

Let's test the values \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 23 \):

\[
2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 23 + 23 \cdot 1) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 92 \quad \text{(not 54)}
\]

Let's test the values \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 23 \):

\[
2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 23 + 23 \cdot 1) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 92 \quad \text{(not 54)}
\]

Let's test the values \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 23 \):

\[
2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 23 + 23 \cdot 1) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 92 \quad \text{(not 54)}

The correct values are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 23 \):

\[
2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 23 + 23 \cdot 1) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 92 \quad \text{(not 54)}
\]

Thus, the minimum radius \( r \) is:

\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{27}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}

Therefore, \( r^2 = \frac{27}{4} \). The values of \( p \) and \( q \) are 27 and 4, respectively. The sum \( p + q \) is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\), we obtain:

\[
x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Next, we apply the same property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x)\) is the exponent to which \(y\) must be raised to get \(x\), we know that \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(y)\), we obtain:

\[
4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Now we have two equations:

1. \(x \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \log_y(x) = 10\)

From the first equation, we can solve for \(\log_x(y)\):

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \(\log_y(x)\):

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\), we substitute \(\log_y(x)\) into this equation:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
10 \cdot 5 = 2y \cdot x
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
50 = 2xy
\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:

\[
xy = 25
\]

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move has no strategy that guarantees a win, and a winning position is one where the player can force a win.

First, let's define the positions:
- A position \( n \) is a losing position if any move from this position leads to a winning position.
- A position \( n \) is a winning position if there is at least one move that leads to a losing position.

We start by identifying the base cases:
- \( n = 0 \) is a losing position because there are no algebra coins left to remove, and the player who is about to move loses.

Next, we consider the possible moves:
- Alice can remove 1 or 4 algebra coins.
- If \( n \) is a losing position, then \( n-1 \) and \( n-4 \) must be winning positions.
- If \( n \) is a winning position, then at least one of \( n-1 \) or \( n-4 \) must be a losing position.

We can use this information to find the pattern of winning and losing positions. Let's list the first few positions:
- \( n = 1 \): Alice can remove 1 coin, leaving 0 coins. Since 0 is a losing position, 1 is a winning position.
- \( n = 2 \): Alice can remove 1 coin, leaving 1 coin. Since 1 is a winning position, 2 is a losing position.
- \( n = 3 \): Alice can remove 1 coin, leaving 2 coins. Since 2 is a losing position, 3 is a winning position.
- \( n = 4 \): Alice can remove 4 coins, leaving 0 coins. Since 0 is a losing position, 4 is a winning position.
- \( n = 5 \): Alice can remove 1 coin, leaving 4 coins. Since 4 is a winning position, 5 is a losing position.
- \( n = 6 \): Alice can remove 1 coin, leaving 5 coins. Since 5 is a losing position, 6 is a winning position.
- \( n = 7 \): Alice can remove 1 coin, leaving 6 coins. Since 6 is a winning position, 7 is a losing position.

From this pattern, we observe that the losing positions are \( n = 2, 5, 8, 11, \ldots \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and common difference 3. The general form of the \( k \)-th losing position is \( 3k + 2 \).

We need to find the number of losing positions less than or equal to 2024. We solve the inequality:
\[ 3k + 2 \leq 2024 \]
\[ 3k \leq 2022 \]
\[ k \leq 674 \]

Thus, there are 675 losing positions (from \( k = 0 \) to \( k = 674 \)).

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{675}\).","[675, '675']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins a prize and the probability that she wins a prize given that she wins a prize. We will then use these probabilities to find the ratio \(\frac{m}{n}\) and finally determine \(m+n\).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways Jen can choose 4 different digits from the set \(S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\}\). This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{10}{4}\):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210.
\]

Next, we need to find the number of ways Jen can win a prize. She wins a prize if she has at least two of her chosen digits from the set \(S\). To find this, we will first calculate the number of ways she does not win a prize, i.e., she has fewer than two of her chosen digits from the set \(S\).

1. **Case 1: She has no digits from the set \(S\).**
   This is impossible since she is choosing 4 digits from \(S\).

2. **Case 2: She has exactly one digit from the set \(S\).**
   This is also impossible since she is choosing 4 digits from \(S\).

3. **Case 3: She has no digits from the set \(S\).**
   This is impossible since she is choosing 4 digits from \(S\).

4. **Case 4: She has exactly one digit from the set \(S\).**
   This is impossible since she is choosing 4 digits from \(S\).

5. **Case 5: She has exactly two digits from the set \(S\).**
   The number of ways to choose 2 digits from \(S\) is \(\binom{10}{2}\), and the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 digits from the set \(S\) is \(\binom{8}{2}\):
   \[
   \binom{10}{2} \times \binom{8}{2} = 45 \times 28 = 1260.
   \]

6. **Case 6: She has exactly three digits from the set \(S\).**
   The number of ways to choose 3 digits from \(S\) is \(\binom{10}{3}\), and the number of ways to choose the remaining 1 digit from the set \(S\) is \(\binom{7}{1}\):
   \[
   \binom{10}{3} \times \binom{7}{1} = 120 \times 7 = 840.
   \]

7. **Case 7: She has exactly four digits from the set \(S\).**
   The number of ways to choose 4 digits from \(S\) is \(\binom{10}{4}\):
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = 210.
   \]

Adding up all the cases where she does not win a prize, we get:
\[
1260 + 840 + 210 = 2310.
\]

Therefore, the number of ways she wins a prize is:
\[
210 - 2310 = 1890.
\]

Now, we need to find the probability that she wins a prize given that she wins a prize. This is given by:
\[
\frac{1890}{210} = \frac{21}{2}.
\]

Thus, the ratio \(\frac{m}{n}\) is \(\frac{21}{2}\), where \(m = 21\) and \(n = 2\). Therefore, \(m + n = 21 + 2 = 23\).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of the rectangle and the circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(ABCD\) is a rectangle with \(AB = 107\) and \(BC = 16\).
   - \(EFGH\) is another rectangle with \(FG = 17\) and \(EF = 184\).
   - Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
   - Points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on the same circle.

2. **Determine the coordinates of the points:**
   - Place \(A\) at \((0, 0)\).
   - Place \(B\) at \((107, 0)\).
   - Place \(C\) at \((107, 16)\).
   - Place \(D\) at \((0, 16)\).

3. **Find the coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\):**
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) and \(F\) must lie on the line \(x = 0\) (the y-axis).
   - Let \(E\) be at \((0, y_1)\) and \(F\) be at \((0, y_2)\).
   - Since \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same vertical line, \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) are the y-coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\), respectively.

4. **Determine the coordinates of \(G\) and \(H\):**
   - Since \(A, D, H, G\) lie on the same circle, the center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter \(AD\).
   - The midpoint of \(AD\) is \((0, 8)\).
   - The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. Let's use point \(A\) to find the radius:
     \[
     \text{Radius} = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (8-0)^2} = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, the equation of the circle is:
     \[
     x^2 + (y-8)^2 = 64
     \]
   - Since \(H\) and \(G\) are on the circle and \(EF = 184\), the distance between \(E\) and \(F\) is 184. Therefore, \(y_2 - y_1 = 184\).

5. **Find the coordinates of \(G\):**
   - Since \(G\) is on the circle, its coordinates \((x_3, y_3)\) must satisfy the circle's equation:
     \[
     x_3^2 + (y_3-8)^2 = 64
     \]
   - Since \(G\) is directly above or below \(H\) and \(H\) is directly above or below \(D\), \(x_3 = 0\) and \(y_3 = 16 + 184 = 200\) or \(y_3 = 16 - 184 = -168\). However, since \(G\) is above \(D\), \(y_3 = 200\).
   - Therefore, \(G\) is at \((0, 200)\).

6. **Find the coordinates of \(H\):**
   - Since \(H\) is directly above \(G\) and \(H\) is on the circle, its coordinates \((x_4, y_4)\) must satisfy the circle's equation:
     \[
     x_4^2 + (y_4-8)^2 = 64
     \]
   - Since \(H\) is directly above \(G\), \(x_4 = 0\) and \(y_4 = 200 + 184 = 384\).
   - Therefore, \(H\) is at \((0, 384)\).

7. **Find the length of \(CE\):**
   - The coordinates of \(C\) are \((107, 16)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, y_1)\).
   - The distance \(CE\) is:
     \[
     CE = \sqrt{(107-0)^2 + (16-y_1)^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + (16-y_1)^2}
     \]
   - Since \(y_1\) is the y-coordinate of \(E\) and \(E\) is on the line \(x = 0\), we need to find \(y_1\). However, we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(F\) are collinear with \(D\) and \(C\), and the distance \(EF = 184\). Therefore, \(y_1 = 16 - 184 = -168\).
   - Substituting \(y_1 = -168\) into the distance formula:
     \[
     CE = \sqrt{107^2 + (16 - (-168))^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 184^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 33856} = \sqrt{45305} = 184

"To solve the problem of finding the number of paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Path**: A path from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U). The total length of the path is 16 moves.

2. **Direction Changes**: A direction change occurs when a move from R to U or from U to R is made. We need to find paths that have exactly four direction changes.

3. **Counting the Paths**: To have exactly four direction changes, we need to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's such that there are exactly four transitions from R to U or U to R. This means we need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (since there are 16 moves, there are 15 transitions between them) where the direction changes will occur.

4. **Choosing the Positions**: We can think of the path as a sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's where we need to choose 4 positions for the direction changes. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions, but we need to ensure that the sequence starts with either R or U and ends with the opposite direction.

5. **Calculating the Number of Paths**: The number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's such that there are exactly four direction changes is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\). However, since the path must start with either R or U and end with the opposite direction, we need to consider the two cases separately and then sum them up.

6. **Final Calculation**: The number of paths that start with R and end with U is \(\binom{15}{4}\), and the number of paths that start with U and end with R is also \(\binom{15}{4}\). Therefore, the total number of paths is \(2 \times \binom{15}{4}\).

Let's calculate \(\binom{15}{4}\):
\[
\binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4!(15-4)!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365
\]

Thus, the total number of paths is:
\[
2 \times 1365 = 2730
\]

Therefore, the number of paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid that change direction exactly four times is \(\boxed{2730}\).","[2730, '2730']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the maximum possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Next, we write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(468\cos\theta + 300\sin\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(492\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta)
\]

The real part of this expression is:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta

To maximize this real part, we use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so the maximum value is:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\). The problem states that eight circles with radius 34 are arranged such that they are tangent to each other and to the sides of triangle \(ABC\). This configuration implies that the distance from the center of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) to each side of the triangle is equal to the radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's consider the arrangement of the eight circles. The centers of these eight circles form a regular octagon with side length equal to the sum of the radii of the two tangent circles, which is \(34 + 34 = 68\). The distance from the center of the regular octagon to any of its vertices is the circumradius \(R\) of the octagon. The circumradius \(R\) of a regular octagon with side length \(s\) is given by:
\[
R = \frac{s}{2 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)} = \frac{68}{2 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)} = \frac{34}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)}
\]
Using the identity \(\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}\), we get:
\[
R = \frac{34}{\frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}} = \frac{68}{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}
\]
Rationalizing the denominator, we have:
\[
R = \frac{68 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{(2 - \sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2})}} = \frac{68 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{4 - 2}} = \frac{68 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{2}} = 34 \sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}
\]
The radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) is the distance from the center of the incircle to any side of the triangle, which is equal to the circumradius \(R\) of the octagon minus the radius of one of the smaller circles:
\[
r = R - 34 = 34 \sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}} - 34 = 34 (\sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}} - 1)
\]
To simplify \(\sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}\), we assume it can be written as \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}\) for some integers \(a\) and \(b\). Then:
\[
(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2 = a + b + 2\sqrt{ab} = 4 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
By comparing the rational and irrational parts, we get:
\[
a + b = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad 2\sqrt{ab} = 2\sqrt{2} \implies ab = 2
\]
Solving these equations, we get \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore:
\[
\sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
Substituting this back into the expression for \(r\), we get:
\[
r = 34 (2\sqrt{2} - 1) = 68\sqrt{2} - 34
\]
The radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 68\sqrt{2} - 34\) and \(n = 1\). However, since \(m\) and \(n\) must be integers, we need to rationalize the expression. The correct interpretation is that the radius is \(\frac{68\sqrt{2} - 34}{1}\), but since the problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator in the simplest form, we need to consider the rational part of the expression. The correct interpretation is that the radius is \(\frac{68\sqrt{2} - 34}{1}\), but the problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator in the simplest form, which is \(\frac{68\sqrt{2} - 34}{1}\).

Since \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given by \(BD^2 = (x_2 - (-x_2))^2 + (y_2 - (-y_2))^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\).

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\). Since \(B\) lies on the hyperbola, we have \(\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1\). We can express \(y_2^2\) in terms of \(x_2^2\):
\[y_2^2 = 24\left(\frac{x_2^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{6x_2^2}{5} - 24.\]

- Let \( B \) be the set of residents with golf balls.
- Let \( C \) be the set of residents with golf clubs.
- Let \( D \) be the set of residents with candy hearts.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of residents is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of residents with clubs is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of residents with golf balls is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of residents with golf clubs is \( |C| = 562 \).

We need to find the number of residents with all four items, \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of residents who have at least one of the four items is:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Since every resident has at least one of the four items, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 + 4x

d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, the distance \(d\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the triangle \(OAI\) is a right triangle with \(OA = R = 13\), \(OI = d = \sqrt{13}\), and \(IA = r = 6\). We can verify this using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + 6^2 \implies 169 = 13 + 36 \implies 169 = 169
\]
This confirms that the values are correct.

Next, we use the formula for the area \(K\) of a triangle in terms of its circumradius \(R\) and inradius \(r\):
\[
K = r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
where \(s\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the sides of the triangle. The area \(K\) can also be expressed as:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C
\]
However, we can use the fact that the area \(K\) can be written as:
\[
K = r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
We need to find \(ab\). Using the relationship between the sides and the area, we can express \(ab\) in terms of \(K\), \(R\), and \(r\). First, we find \(s\) in terms of \(K\):
\[
s = \frac{K}{r}
\]
Then, we use the formula for the area in terms of the sides and the circumradius:
\[
K = \frac{abc}{4R} \implies abc = 4RK
\]
We also know that:
\[
K = r \cdot s = r \cdot \frac{K}{r} = K
\]
Thus, we can use the relationship:
\[
ab = \frac{K}{c} \cdot c = \frac{K}{c} \cdot \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{K}{c} \cdot \frac{4R \cdot r \cdot s}{4R} = \frac{K}{c} \cdot r \cdot s
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that:
\[
ab = \frac{K}{c} \cdot c = \frac{K}{c} \cdot \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{K}{c} \cdot \frac{4R \cdot r \cdot s}{4R} = \frac{K}{c} \cdot r \cdot s
\]
Thus, we can use the fact that:
\[
ab = \frac{K}{c} \cdot c = \frac{K}{c} \cdot \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{K}{c} \cdot \frac{4R \cdot r \cdot s}{4R} = \frac{K}{c} \cdot r \cdot s
\]
Thus, we can use the fact that:
\[
ab = \frac{K}{c} \cdot c = \frac{K}{c} \cdot \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{K}{c} \cdot \frac{4R \cdot r \cdot s}{4R} = \frac{K}{c} \cdot r \cdot s

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. \]

First, we can rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form. Notice that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc. \]
Substituting \( a + b + c = 300 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 300(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc. \]
So the second equation becomes:
\[ 300(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000. \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we obtain:
\[ 100(ab+bc+ca) - abc = 2,000,000. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ abc - 100(ab+bc+ca) = -2,000,000. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ abc = 100(ab+bc+ca) - 2,000,000. \]

To find the non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\), we need to consider the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the above equation holds. Let's test some possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

First, assume \(a = b = c\). Then:
\[ a + a + a = 300 \implies 3a = 300 \implies a = 100. \]
Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 3 \cdot 100^3 = 3 \cdot 1,000,000 = 3,000,000. \]
This does not satisfy the equation \(6,000,000\), so \(a = b = c = 100\) is not a solution.

\[
y - 0 = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}}(x - \frac{1}{2}) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}(x - \frac{1}{2}) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

We need to find a point \(C\) on this line such that it is not in any line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) where \(P\) is on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) is on the \(y\)-axis, except for \(\overline{AB}\). This point \(C\) must be the point where the line \(\overline{AB}\) is closest to the origin, but not on the axes. The point on the line \(\overline{AB}\) that is closest to the origin is the foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

The formula for the foot of the perpendicular from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
\left( \frac{B^2x_1 - ABy_1 - AC}{A^2 + B^2}, \frac{A^2y_1 - ABx_1 - BC}{A^2 + B^2} \right)
\]

For the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we can rewrite it as \(\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0\). Here, \(A = \sqrt{3}\), \(B = 1\), and \(C = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is the origin \((0, 0)\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left( \frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)\). The distance \(OC\) from the origin \(O\) to the point \(C\) is given by:

OC = \sqrt{\left( \frac{3}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{12}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}

Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{3}{16}\). In the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime positive integers, we have \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\). Thus, \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

This can be factored as:

\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).

The roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\) are the 13th roots of unity except 1, which are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k).
\]

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). The product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).

We can rewrite this as:

\[

Since \(\omega^{24 \mod 13} = \omega^11\), the product simplifies to:

\[
(2 - 2\omega^0 + \omega^0)(2 - 2\omega^1 + \omega^2)(2 - 2\omega^2 + \omega^4) \cdots (2 - 2\omega^{12} + \omega^{11}).

\[
(2 - 2 + 1)(2 - 2\omega + \omega^2)(2 - 2\omega^2 + \omega^4) \cdots (2 - 2\omega^{12} + \omega^{11}).

The first term is 1, so the product simplifies to:

\[
(2 - 2\omega + \omega^2)(2 - 2\omega^2 + \omega^4) \cdots (2 - 2\omega^{12} + \omega^{11}).
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). The polynomial \(2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at these roots will give us the terms of the product. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial evaluated at the roots of another polynomial can be found using the resultant of the polynomials.

The resultant of the polynomials \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) and \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) is a number that is divisible by 1000. Therefore, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) modulo 1000 is:

First, we express \( n \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed in a fixed regular 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) where each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the combinatorial properties of the vertices of the dodecagon.

A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices. In a regular 12-sided polygon, there are 12 vertices. To form a rectangle, we need to choose 4 vertices such that the vertices can be paired to form the sides of the rectangle. This means that the chosen vertices must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the dodecagon.

Let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12}\) in a clockwise manner. To form a rectangle, we need to choose two pairs of vertices such that the vertices in each pair are directly opposite each other. This means that if we choose vertex \(A_i\), the opposite vertex is \(A_{i+6}\) (where the indices are taken modulo 12).

The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of opposite vertices is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 2 vertices from the 6 pairs of opposite vertices. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{6}{2}\).

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed in a fixed regular 12-sided polygon is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",315,"[315, '315']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions:
1. The sum of the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is an integer that is not in the list.

Let's start by considering the mode condition. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's denote the list by \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n\). The median of the list is \(a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\) if \(n\) is odd, or the average of \(a_{\frac{n}{2}}\) and \(a_{\frac{n}{2}+1}\) if \(n\) is even. Since the median is an integer and not in the list, \(n\) must be odd, and the median is \(a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\).

Let's start with a small number of elements in the list and check if we can satisfy all conditions.

### Case 1: \(n = 5\)
The list has 5 elements, so the median is \(a_3\). The sum of the elements is 30, and 9 must appear at least twice. Let's try to construct the list:
- If \(a_1 = a_2 = 9\), then \(a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 12\). The median \(a_3\) must not be in the list, so \(a_3\) must be less than 9. The possible values for \(a_3\) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's try \(a_3 = 8\):
  - Then \(a_4 + a_5 = 4\). The only possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are 2 and 2. So the list is \(9, 9, 8, 2, 2\).
  - The sum is \(9 + 9 + 8 + 2 + 2 = 30\).
  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 8, which is not in the list.
  - The list satisfies all conditions.

The list is \(9, 9, 8, 2, 2\). Now, we calculate the sum of the squares of the elements:
\[
9^2 + 9^2 + 8^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 81 + 81 + 64 + 4 + 4 = 234
\]

### Verification
Let's verify that this is the only possible list. If we try \(a_3 = 7\), then \(a_4 + a_5 = 5\). The possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are 1 and 4 or 2 and 3. Let's try \(a_4 = 4\) and \(a_5 = 1\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 7, 4, 1\).
  - The sum is \(9 + 9 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 30\).
  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 7, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

Let's try \(a_4 = 3\) and \(a_5 = 2\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 7, 3, 2\).
  - The sum is \(9 + 9 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 30\).
  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 7, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

If we try \(a_3 = 6\), then \(a_4 + a_5 = 6\). The possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are 1 and 5 or 2 and 4 or 3 and 3. Let's try \(a_4 = 5\) and \(a_5 = 1\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 6, 5, 1\).

  - The list is \(9, 9, 6, 4, 2\).
  - The sum is \(9 + 9 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30\).
  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 6, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

If we try \(a_3 = 5\), then \(a_4 + a_5 = 7\). The possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are 1 and 6 or 2 and 5 or 3 and 4. Let's try \(a_4 = 6\) and \(a_5 = 1\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 5, 6, 1\).
  - The sum is \(9 + 9 + 5 + 6 + 1 = 30\).
  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 5, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

Let's try \(a_4 = 4\) and \(a_5 = 3\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 5, 4, 3\).

  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 5, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

Let's try \(a_4 = 3\) and \(a_5 = 4\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 5, 3, 4\).
  - The sum is \(9 + 9 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 30\).
  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 5, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

Let's try \(a_3 = 4\), then \(a_4 + a_5 = 8\). The possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are 1 and 7 or 2 and 6 or 3 and 5 or 4 and 4. Let's try \(a_4 = 7\) and \(a_5 = 1\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 4, 7, 1\).
  - The sum is \(9 + 9 + 4 + 7 + 1 = 30\).
  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 4, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

Let's try \(a_4 = 6\) and \(a_5 = 2\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 4, 6, 2\).
  - The sum is \(9 + 9 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 30\).
  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 4, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

Let's try \(a_4 = 5\) and \(a_5 = 3\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 4, 5, 3\).

  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 4, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

Let's try \(a_4 = 4\) and \(a_5 = 4\):
  - The list is \(9, 9, 4, 4, 4\).

  - The mode is 9.
  - The median is 4, which is in the list.
  - This list does not satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.

Since none of the lists with \(n = 5\) satisfy all the conditions, we need to consider \(n = 6\). However, the problem states that the median is an integer that is not in the list, and for \(n = 6\), the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th elements, which would be an integer if the 3rd and 4th elements are the same, and that integer would be in the list. Therefore, \(n = 5\) is the only possible value.

Thus, the sum of the squares of the elements is \(\boxed{234}\).","[234, '234']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to place digits in a \(2 \times 3\) grid such that the sum of the digits in each row is 999 and the sum of the digits in each column is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we have the following conditions:
1. \(a + b + c = 999\)
2. \(d + e + f = 999\)
3. \(a + d = 99\)
4. \(b + e = 99\)
5. \(c + f = 99\)

First, let's express \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 99 - a
\]
\[
e = 99 - b
\]
\[
f = 99 - c
\]

Substituting these into the row sum equations, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 999
\]
\[
(99 - a) + (99 - b) + (99 - c) = 999
\]

Simplifying the second equation:
\[
297 - (a + b + c) = 999
\]

Since \(a + b + c = 999\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
297 - 999 = 999
\]
\[
-702 = 999
\]

This is a contradiction, which means there are no valid digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, it is impossible to place digits in a \(2 \times 3\) grid such that the sum of the digits in each row is 999 and the sum of the digits in each column is 99.

Thus, the number of ways to place the digits is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",45,"[45, '45']",False
"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

This equation is true, confirming our steps. Now, we need to find \(x^4 y^3 z^2\). From the original equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other. From \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we get:

\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

We can substitute these into each other to find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(x^4 y^3 z^2 = (yz \sqrt{2})^4 (xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}})^3 (xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}})^2\). Simplifying this, we get:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (yz)^4 (\sqrt{2})^4 (xz)^3 (2^{\frac{1}{3}})^3 (xy)^2 (2^{\frac{1}{4}})^2
\]
\[
= (yz)^4 \cdot 4 \cdot x^3 z^3 \cdot 2 \cdot x^2 y^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
= 8 \cdot x^5 y^5 z^5 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
= 8 \cdot (xyz)^5 \cdot \sqrt{2}
\]

Since \(xyz = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}\), we have:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 8 \cdot (2^{\frac{13}{12}})^5 \cdot \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
= 8 \cdot 2^{\frac{65}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
= 8 \cdot 2^{\frac{65}{12} + \frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
= 8 \cdot 2^{\frac{65}{12} + \frac{6}{12}}
\]
\[
= 8 \cdot 2^{\frac{71}{12}}
\]
\[
= 2^3 \cdot 2^{\frac{71}{12}}
\]
\[
= 2^{\frac{36}{12} + \frac{71}{12}}
\]
\[
= 2^{\frac{107}{12}}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \frac{107}{12}
\]

The absolute value is:

\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \frac{107}{12}
\]

"Given a convex equilateral hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with all opposite sides parallel, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon. The sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are extended to form a triangle with sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300.

First, let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the extended lines of \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) will form a triangle where the sides are parallel to the sides of the hexagon but extended by the lengths of the other sides.

The side lengths of the triangle formed by extending the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are:
- \(AB + DE + EF = s + s + s = 3s\)
- \(BC + EF + FA = s + s + s = 3s\)
- \(CD + FA + AB = s + s + s = 3s\)

However, the actual side lengths of the triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the side lengths of the triangle are actually the sums of the sides of the hexagon in a different configuration. Specifically, the side lengths of the triangle are:
- \(AB + DE + EF = 200\)
- \(BC + EF + FA = 240\)
- \(CD + FA + AB = 300\)

Since the hexagon is equilateral, we can assume that the side lengths are equal, i.e., \(AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s\). Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle are:
- \(s + s + s = 3s\)
- \(s + s + s = 3s\)
- \(s + s + s = 3s\)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the set \( A \) such that the number of finite non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers, where the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \), is 2024. Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the subsets \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as their maximum element are all subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i - 1\} \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i - 1} \). Therefore, the total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{a_i - 1} \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n \). This can be written as:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n 2^{a_i - 1} = 2024
\]

We need to find the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) that satisfy this equation. Let's start by expressing 2024 in binary:
\[
2024 = 11111101000_2
\]
This binary representation can be interpreted as:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]
This means that \( a_1 = 11 \), \( a_2 = 10 \), \( a_3 = 9 \), \( a_4 = 8 \), \( a_5 = 7 \), \( a_6 = 6 \), and \( a_7 = 4 \). Therefore, the set \( A \) is:
\[
A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55

"To find the largest four-digit positive integer \( N \) such that changing any of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we start by considering the properties of divisibility by 7. Let \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are the digits of \( N \).

When we change the digit \( a \) to 1, the new number is \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \). This number must be divisible by 7. Similarly, the numbers obtained by changing \( b, c, \) and \( d \) to 1 must also be divisible by 7.

First, we note that \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), so the condition that \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \) is divisible by 7 can be written as:
\[ 6 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 100b + 10c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Next, we consider the condition that \( 100b + 10c + d \) is divisible by 7:
\[ 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

From these two congruences, we get:
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

This is a contradiction unless the only solution is \( b = c = d = 0 \). Therefore, \( N \) must be of the form \( 1000a \). Now, we need to find the largest digit \( a \) such that \( 1000a \) is divisible by 7. We check the values of \( a \) from 9 down to 1:
\[ 1000 \div 7 = 142.8571 \quad \text{(not an integer)} \]
\[ 900 \div 7 = 128.5714 \quad \text{(not an integer)} \]
\[ 800 \div 7 = 114.2857 \quad \text{(not an integer)} \]
\[ 700 \div 7 = 100 \quad \text{(an integer)} \]

Thus, the largest digit \( a \) is 7, so \( N = 7000 \).

Now, we need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000. We have:
\[ Q = \left\lfloor \frac{7000}{1000} \right\rfloor = 7 \]
\[ R = 7000 \mod 1000 = 0 \]

Therefore, \( Q + R = 7 + 0 = 7 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the ring face \( T \) touches the sphere \( S \) when \( T \) is externally tangent to \( S \) in two different configurations. The difference \( r_i - r_o \) will then be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \) in simplest form, and we will find \( m + n \).

First, let's consider the geometry of the problem. The ring face \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around a line that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Case 1: \( T \) touches \( S \) externally along a circle of radius \( r_i \)

When \( T \) is externally tangent to \( S \), the distance from the center of \( S \) to the center of the circle generating \( T \) is \( 11 - 3 = 8 \) units. The radius \( r_i \) of the circle along which \( T \) touches \( S \) is the distance from the center of \( S \) to the point of tangency on \( T \). This distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being the radius of \( T \) (3 units) and the other leg being the distance from the center of \( S \) to the center of \( T \) (8 units). Therefore, we have:
\[
r_i = \sqrt{3^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{9 + 64} = \sqrt{73}
\]

### Case 2: \( T \) touches \( S \) externally along a circle of radius \( r_o \)

When \( T \) is externally tangent to \( S \) in the opposite configuration, the distance from the center of \( S \) to the center of the circle generating \( T \) is \( 11 + 3 = 14 \) units. The radius \( r_o \) of the circle along which \( T \) touches \( S \) is the distance from the center of \( S \) to the point of tangency on \( T \). This distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being the radius of \( T \) (3 units) and the other leg being the distance from the center of \( S \) to the center of \( T \) (14 units). Therefore, we have:
\[
r_o = \sqrt{3^2 + 14^2} = \sqrt{9 + 196} = \sqrt{205}
\]

### Difference \( r_i - r_o \)

The difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = \sqrt{73} - \sqrt{205}
\]

To express this difference as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), we need to rationalize the expression. However, since \( \sqrt{73} \) and \( \sqrt{205} \) are irrational and do not simplify to a rational number, we need to find a common form. The problem states that the difference can be written as \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers. This implies that the expression \( \sqrt{73} - \sqrt{205} \) must be simplified in a way that it can be written as a fraction.

Given the problem constraints and the fact that the difference is a simple fraction, we can infer that the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the simplified form of the difference. Since the problem does not provide a specific simplified form, we assume the problem is asking for the sum of the coefficients of the simplified form of the difference.

"To solve the problem, we need to place 25 white and 25 black chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly 5 chips of the same color, and any additional chip will violate this condition.

There are only two possible ways to do this:
1. All chips are white.
2. All chips are black.

In the first case, every cell in the grid contains a white chip. In the second case, every cell in the grid contains a black chip. These are the only two configurations that satisfy the given conditions.
