"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Aya's car takes to travel a certain distance, including the time spent at the café. Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - \( s \) is the speed in kilometers per hour.
   - \( t \) is the time spent at the café in minutes.
   - \( d \) is the distance traveled in kilometers.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - When Aya travels at speed \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes at the café. The time spent driving is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance traveled is \( d = s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) \).
   - When Aya travels at speed \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes at the café. The time spent driving is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} - \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance traveled is \( d = (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) \).

3. **Equate the distances:**
   Since the distance \( d \) is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \( d \) equal to each other:
   \[
   s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
   \]

4. **Expand and simplify the equation:**
   \[
   4s - \frac{st}{60} = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60}
   \]
   Subtract \( 4s - \frac{st}{60} \) from both sides:
   \[
   0 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{2t}{60}
   \]
   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   0 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{t}{30}
   \]
   Rearrange to solve for \( t \):
   \[
   \frac{t}{30} = 2.4s + 4.8
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 30:
   \[
   t = 72s + 144
   \]

5. **Determine the distance \( d \):**
   Substitute \( t = 72s + 144 \) back into the expression for \( d \):
   \[
   d = s \left( 4 - \frac{72s + 144}{60} \right) = s \left( 4 - \frac{6s + 12}{5} \right) = s \left( 4 - \frac{6s}{5} - \frac{12}{5} \right) = s \left( \frac{20}{5} - \frac{6s}{5} - \frac{12}{5} \right) = s \left( \frac{8}{5} - \frac{6s}{5} \right) = s \left( \frac{8 - 6s}{5} \right) = \frac{s(8 - 6s)}{5}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time spent driving at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h:**
   The time spent driving is:
   \[
   \frac{d}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{s(8 - 6s)}{5}}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{s(8 - 6s)}{5(s + \frac{1}{2})} = \frac{s(8 - 6s)}{5 \cdot \frac{2s + 1}{2}} = \frac{s(8 - 6s) \cdot 2}{5(2s + 1)} = \frac{2s(8 - 6s)}{5(2s + 1)}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time including the time spent at the café:**
   The total time is:
   \[
   \frac{2s(8 - 6s)}{5(2s + 1)} + 72s + 144
   \]

8. **Determine the value of \( s \):**
   From the equation \( t = 72s + 144 \), we need to find \( s \). However, we can see that the expression for \( t \) is already in terms of \( s \), and we don't need to solve for \( s \) explicitly to find the total time. Instead, we can use the fact that the total time is a function of \( s \) and the given conditions.

9. **Simplify the expression for the total time:**
   Since the problem asks for the total time including the time spent at the café, and we have the expression in terms of \( s \), we can conclude that the total time is:
   \[
   \boxed{100}
   \] (This is the total time in minutes, including the time spent at the café, based on the given conditions and the problem constraints).","[100, '100']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for \(AP\) in the given problem, we start by using the Power of a Point theorem and properties of the incircle and tangents to a circle.

First, we note that \(D\) is the point where the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\) to the incircle \(\omega\) meet. By the Power of a Point theorem, we have:
\[DB^2 = DC^2 = DP \cdot DA.\]

Next, we use the fact that \(D\) is the exsimilicenter of the incircle and the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\). This implies that \(D\) lies on the line \(AI\) (where \(I\) is the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\)) and that \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\).

We can use Stewart's Theorem to find \(AD\). Stewart's Theorem states:
\[AB^2 \cdot DC + AC^2 \cdot DB = AD^2 \cdot BC + BC \cdot DB \cdot DC.\]
Since \(DB = DC\), we can simplify this to:
\[AB^2 \cdot DB + AC^2 \cdot DB = AD^2 \cdot BC + BC \cdot DB^2.\]
Factoring out \(DB\) on the left side, we get:
\[DB (AB^2 + AC^2) = AD^2 \cdot BC + BC \cdot DB^2.\]
Dividing both sides by \(BC\), we have:
\[DB \left( \frac{AB^2 + AC^2}{BC} \right) = AD^2 + DB^2.\]
Since \(DB = DC\), we can use the fact that \(DB = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{AB + AC}\) (this is a well-known formula for the length of the tangent from a vertex to the point of tangency of the incircle):
\[DB = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{5 + 10} = \frac{50}{15} = \frac{10}{3}.\]
Substituting \(DB = \frac{10}{3}\) and \(BC = 9\) into the equation, we get:
\[\frac{10}{3} \left( \frac{5^2 + 10^2}{9} \right) = AD^2 + \left( \frac{10}{3} \right)^2.\]
Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[\frac{10}{3} \left( \frac{25 + 100}{9} \right) = AD^2 + \frac{100}{9},\]
\[\frac{10}{3} \left( \frac{125}{9} \right) = AD^2 + \frac{100}{9},\]
\[\frac{1250}{27} = AD^2 + \frac{100}{9},\]
\[\frac{1250}{27} = AD^2 + \frac{300}{27},\]
\[\frac{950}{27} = AD^2,\]
\[AD = \frac{\sqrt{950}}{3} = \frac{5\sqrt{38}}{3}.\]

Now, we use the fact that \(P\) is the other intersection of \(AD\) with the incircle. By the Power of a Point theorem again, we have:
\[AP \cdot PD = DB^2.\]
Since \(PD = AD - AP\), we substitute:
\[AP \cdot (AD - AP) = DB^2,\]
\[AP \cdot \left( \frac{5\sqrt{38}}{3} - AP \right) = \left( \frac{10}{3} \right)^2,\]
\[AP \cdot \left( \frac{5\sqrt{38}}{3} - AP \right) = \frac{100}{9},\]
\[\frac{5\sqrt{38}}{3} \cdot AP - AP^2 = \frac{100}{9},\]
\[9\sqrt{38} \cdot AP - 9AP^2 = 100,\]
\[9AP^2 - 9\sqrt{38} \cdot AP + 100 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(AP = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 9\), \(b = -9\sqrt{38}\), and \(c = 100\):
\[AP = \frac{9\sqrt{38} \pm \sqrt{(9\sqrt{38})^2 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 100}}{2 \cdot 9},\]
\[AP = \frac{9\sqrt{38} \pm \sqrt{81 \cdot 38 - 3600}}{18},\]
\[AP = \frac{9\sqrt{38} \pm \sqrt{3078 - 3600}}{18},\]
\[AP = \frac{9\sqrt{38} \pm \sqrt{278}}{18},\]
\[AP = \frac{9\sqrt{38} \pm 3\sqrt{31}}{18},\]
\[AP = \frac{3\sqrt{38} \pm \sqrt{31}}{6}.\]
Since \(AP\) must be less than \(AD\), we take the smaller root:
\[AP = \frac{3\sqrt{38} - \sqrt{31}}{6}.\]
However, we need to express \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). By the properties of the incircle and the tangents, we know that \(AP = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area of } \triangle ABC}{BC + CA + AB}\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be found using Heron's formula, but for simplicity, we use the fact that \(AP = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area of } \triangle ABC}{BC + CA + AB} = \frac{2 \cdot 84}{24} = \frac{14}{3}\).

Thus, \(AP = \frac{14}{3}\), and \(m + n = 14 + 3 = \boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",113,"[113, '113']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that after roting an octagon such that all the blue sides end up on the positions where the originally red sides were, the resulting octagon has no two adjacent sides of the same color. Let's denote the sides of the octagon as \( R_1, B_1, R_2, B_2, R_3, B_3, R_4, B_4 \) where \( R_i \) is a red side and \( B_i \) is a blue side.

First, we need to count the number of valid permutations of the sides such that no two adjacent sides are the same color. This is equivalent to finding the number of valid permutations of the sequence \( R_1, B_1, R_2, B_2, R_3, B_3, R_4, B_4 \) where no two consecutive sides are the same.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid permutations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the problem is symmetric and the probability of each valid permutation is the same. We can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming to find the number of valid permutations, but here we will use a known result for this type of problem.

The number of valid permutations of \( 2n \) sides where no two consecutive sides are the same is given by the formula \( 2 \cdot (n!)^2 \). For \( n = 4 \), this gives:
\[
2 \cdot (4!)^2 = 2 \cdot 24^2 = 2 \cdot 576 = 1152
\]

Next, we need to count the total number of permutations of the 8 sides. Since there are 4 red sides and 4 blue sides, the total number of permutations is:
\[
\frac{8!}{4!4!} = \frac{40320}{24 \cdot 24} = 70
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen permutation is valid is the ratio of the number of valid permutations to the total number of permutations:
\[
\frac{1152}{70}
\]

We need to simplify this fraction. The greatest common divisor of 1152 and 70 is 2, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{1152 \div 2}{70 \div 2} = \frac{576}{35}
\]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{576}{35} \). Since 576 and 35 are relatively prime, we have \( m = 576 \) and \( n = 35 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 576 + 35 = 611 \).

\boxed{611}

"To find the number of intersection points between the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2} \).
  - If \( x < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - x \).

- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \).
  - If \( x < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \).

Now, let's consider the compositions:
\[ f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \]
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).

\[ g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) is in \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will take values in \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\).

\[ 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
This function will take values in \([0, 1]\).

Similarly, for the other function:
\[ f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \]
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).

\[ g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]
Since \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) is in \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will take values in \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\).

\[ 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]
This function will take values in \([0, 1]\).

To find the intersection points, we need to solve:
\[ 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]
\[ g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]

Since \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) is symmetric around \( x = \frac{1}{4} \), we need to consider the points where \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) are equal or symmetric around \( \frac{1}{4} \).

Given the periodicity and symmetry of the sine and cosine functions, we can analyze the behavior over one period and then extend it to the entire domain.

For \( x \in [0, 1] \):
- \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) completes one full cycle from 0 to 1 and back to 0.
- \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) completes one full cycle from 1 to -1 and back to 1.

Each cycle of \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) will intersect at 4 points where \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \).

Since there are 2 cycles of \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and 2 cycles of \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) in the interval \([0, 1]\), the total number of intersection points is:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Thus, the number of intersection points between the graphs is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), given that \( p \) is the smallest prime for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's analyze the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since \( n \) is an integer, we need to consider the factorization over the integers modulo \( p \). We know that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), which implies \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This means that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \), so the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be 8.

Now, we need to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \). This is equivalent to finding the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

From the factorization \( n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1) \), we can see that if \( n \) is a solution, then \( -n \) is also a solution. Therefore, the smallest positive \( m \) is the smallest positive \( n \) that satisfies \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

Since \( n \) is the smallest positive integer such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the smallest positive \( m \) is \( n \) or \( -n \). However, since we are looking for the smallest positive \( m \), we take \( m = n \).

Thus, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is the same as the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its faces, we start by calculating the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron and the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The distance \( r \) from the incenter to each face is given by the formula \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \).

First, we use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( AB = a \), \( AC = b \), \( AD = c \), \( BC = d \), \( BD = e \), and \( CD = f \) is given by:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = \sqrt{80} \), \( e = \sqrt{41} \), and \( f = \sqrt{89} \), we get:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 41 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
-25600
\]
The volume \( V \) is given by:
\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{-\det} = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{25600} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 160 = \frac{80}{3}
\]

Next, we calculate the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). The area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by Heron's formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]
where \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \). For our triangle, \( s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \). However, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) can also be found using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)}
\]
Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24\sqrt{21} = 6\sqrt{21}
\]
Since the tetrahedron has four faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[
S = 4 \cdot 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

Finally, the distance \( r \) from the incenter to each face is:
\[
r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{80}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{80}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{10}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{10\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]
Thus, \( m = 10 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 10 + 21 + 63 = 94 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectoral boxes in the set \(\mathcal{B}\) and then determine the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Finally, we will find \(r^2\) in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime, and then compute \(p+q\).

First, let's denote the dimensions of a rectoral box by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The volume of the box is given by:
\[abc = 23.\]
The surface area of the box is given by:
\[2(ab + bc + ca) = 54.\]
We need to find integer solutions to these equations. Since 23 is a prime number, one of the dimensions must be 1. Without loss of generality, let \(a = 1\). Then the equations become:
\[bc = 23,\]
\[2(b + c) = 54 \implies b + c = 27.\]
The only integer solution to these equations is \(b = 1\) and \(c = 23\) (or vice versa). Therefore, the dimensions of the rectoral box are \(1 \times 1 \times 23\).

Next, we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain this box. The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is the sphere that has a diameter equal to the length of the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \(d\) of a box with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
\[d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}.\]
For the box \(1 \times 1 \times 23\), the space diagonal is:
\[d = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 23^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1 + 529} = \sqrt{531}.\]
The radius \(r\) of the sphere is half of the space diagonal:
\[r = \frac{\sqrt{531}}{2}.\]
Then, \(r^2\) is:
\[r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{531}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{531}{4}.\]
Here, \(p = 531\) and \(q = 4\) are relatively prime. Therefore, \(p + q = 531 + 4 = 535\).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each equation using the properties of logarithms. Recall that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\log_b(b) = 1\). Therefore, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting these into the equations, we have:

\[
x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

We can simplify these equations by multiplying both sides by \(\log(x)\) and \(\log(y)\) respectively:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1. \(x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)\)
2. \(4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)\)

We can solve this system by expressing \(\log(y)\) in terms of \(\log(x)\) from the first equation:

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \left(\frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\right)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\) (because \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]

Solving for \(y\), we get:

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now, we need to find the product \(xy\):

\[
xy = x \left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = 25

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions.

First, let's define the positions:
- A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
- A position is a losing position if any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We start by identifying the base cases:
- If there is 1 brikke left, the player who is about to move wins by taking the last brikke.
- If there are 4 brikke left, the player who is about to move wins by taking all 4 brikke.
- If there are 2, 3, or 5 brikke left, the player who is about to move loses because any move they make will leave the opponent with a winning position (1, 4, or 1 brikke respectively).

From these base cases, we can generalize the pattern:
- A position with \( n \) brikke is a losing position if \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \) is a losing position.
- A position with \( n \) brikke is a winning position if \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \) is a winning position.

We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy. This means we need to find the number of integers \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).

The number of positive integers less than or equal to 2024 is 2024. Since all positive integers are either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5, all 2024 integers are winning positions for Bob.

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{2024}\).","[2024, '2024']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the hovedpremie given that she wins a premie. We will do this by first finding the total number of ways Jen can win a premie and then finding the number of ways she can win the hovedpremie.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways Jen can win a premie
Jen wins a premie if at least two of her four chosen numbers are 2. We will use the principle of complementary counting to find this.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that fewer than 2 of them are 2. There are two cases to consider:
1. No 2 is chosen.
2. Exactly one 2 is chosen.

**Case 1: No 2 is chosen**
We need to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 9 numbers:
\[
\binom{9}{4} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 126
\]

**Case 2: Exactly one 2 is chosen**
We need to choose 1 number from the remaining 9 numbers and 3 numbers from the 2's:
\[
\binom{9}{3} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84
\]

Adding these two cases together gives the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that fewer than 2 of them are 2:
\[
126 + 84 = 210
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least 2 of them are 2 is:
\[
210 - 210 = 0
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the hovedpremie
Jen wins the hovedpremie if all four of her chosen numbers are 2. There is only one way to choose 4 numbers such that all of them are 2:
\[
\binom{1}{4} = 1
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability that Jen wins the hovedpremie given that she wins a premie
Since the number of ways Jen can win a premie is 0, the probability that Jen wins the hovedpremie given that she wins a premie is:
\[
\frac{1}{0} = \infty
\]

However, this is not a valid probability. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the probability is 0 because it is impossible for Jen to win the hovedpremie if she wins a premie.

Thus, the correct answer is:

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the quadrilaterals \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles.

First, let's denote the coordinates of the points:
- \(A = (0, 0)\)
- \(B = (107, 0)\)
- \(C = (107, 16)\)
- \(D = (0, 16)\)

Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle and \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can place \(E\) and \(F\) on the line \(x = 107\). Let \(E = (107, y_1)\) and \(F = (107, y_2)\). Since \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same vertical line, \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) are the y-coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\), respectively.

Given that \(E, F, G, H\) are on a circle, and \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(EG\) and \(FH\) are equal and bisect each other. Therefore, the midpoint of \(EG\) is the same as the midpoint of \(FH\).

Since \(E = (107, y_1)\) and \(F = (107, y_2)\), the midpoint of \(EF\) is \((107, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})\).

Now, let's find the coordinates of \(G\) and \(H\). Since \(G\) and \(H\) are the other vertices of the rectangle \(EFGH\), and \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, \(G\) must be directly above \(F\) and \(H\) must be directly above \(E\). Therefore, \(G = (107, y_2 + 17)\) and \(H = (107, y_1 + 17)\).

The midpoint of \(EG\) is \((107, \frac{y_1 + (y_2 + 17)}{2}) = (107, \frac{y_1 + y_2 + 17}{2})\).

Since the midpoint of \(EG\) is the same as the midpoint of \(FH\), we have:
\[
\frac{y_1 + y_2 + 17}{2} = \frac{y_1 + y_2 + 17}{2}
\]
This equation is always true, so it doesn't provide new information.

Next, we use the given lengths \(FG = 17\) and \(EF = 184\). Since \(F = (107, y_2)\) and \(G = (107, y_2 + 17)\), the distance \(FG\) is:
\[
FG = |(y_2 + 17) - y_2| = 17
\]
This is consistent with the given length.

The distance \(EF\) is:
\[
EF = |(y_2 + 17) - y_1| = 184
\]
This gives us two possible equations:
\[
y_2 + 17 - y_1 = 184 \quad \text{or} \quad y_1 - y_2 - 17 = 184
\]
Simplifying these, we get:
\[
y_2 - y_1 = 167 \quad \text{or} \quad y_1 - y_2 = 201
\]

Since \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same vertical line, \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) must be such that the y-coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\) are consistent with the given lengths. We can choose \(y_2 - y_1 = 167\) without loss of generality.

Now, we need to find the length of \(CE\). The coordinates of \(C\) are \((107, 16)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((107, y_1)\). The distance \(CE\) is:
\[
CE = |y_1 - 16|
\]

From \(y_2 - y_1 = 167\), we can express \(y_2\) as \(y_2 = y_1 + 167\). Since \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same vertical line, the y-coordinate of \(E\) must be such that the distance \(EF\) is 184. Therefore, \(y_1\) must be such that:
\[
|y_1 - (y_1 + 167)| = 184
\]
This equation is not consistent with the given length \(EF = 184\). Therefore, we must have:
\[
y_1 - y_2 = 201
\]

From \(y_1 - y_2 = 201\), we can express \(y_2\) as \(y_2 = y_1 - 201\). Since \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same vertical line, the y-coordinate of \(E\) must be such that the distance \(EF\) is 184. Therefore, \(y_1\) must be such that:
\[
|y_1 - (y_1 - 201)| = 184
\]
This equation is consistent with the given length \(EF = 184\).

Now, we can find the length of \(CE\):
\[
CE = |y_1 - 16|
\]

Since \(y_1\) must be such that the distance \(EF\) is 184, we can choose \(y_1 = 16 + 184 = 200\). Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:
\[
CE = |200 - 16| = 184
\]

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of stene of length 16 that follow the lines from the lower left square to the upper right square of an \(8 \times 8\) grid and change direction exactly four times. Each stene of length 16 corresponds to a path from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of a \(4 \times 4\) grid, where each step is either right or up.

A path from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of a \(4 \times 4\) grid consists of exactly 4 right steps and 4 up steps. The number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 8 for the right steps (or equivalently, the up steps).

"To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta)

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this simplifies to:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)

Combining like terms, we get:

\[

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given that there are 2024 circles with radius 1 that are tangent to the sides of the triangle and to each other in a specific pattern. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Tangent Circles
The problem states that there are 2024 circles with radius 1 that are tangent to the sides of triangle \(ABC\) and to each other. This implies that the circles are arranged in a way that they form a smaller triangle inside \(ABC\) with each side of this smaller triangle being tangent to 2024 circles.

### Step 2: Relating the Number of Circles to the Inradius
The number of circles with radius 1 that can be arranged in this manner is related to the inradius of triangle \(ABC\). Specifically, the number of circles is proportional to the inradius of the triangle. If the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is \(r\), then the number of circles with radius 1 that can be arranged in this manner is approximately \(\frac{r}{1} = r\).

Given that there are 2024 such circles, we can approximate that the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is 2024.

### Step 3: Finding the Inradius
Since the inradius \(r\) is approximately 2024, we can write:
\[
r = 2024
\]

### Step 4: Expressing the Inradius as a Fraction
The problem asks for the inradius in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Since 2024 is an integer, we can write:
\[
r = \frac{2024}{1}
\]

Here, \(m = 2024\) and \(n = 1\). These numbers are relatively prime.

### Step 5: Finding \(m + n\)
Finally, we need to find \(m + n\):
\[
m + n = 2024 + 1 = 2025

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the largest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all rectangles \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

First, let's consider the general form of the points on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be written as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\) respectively. The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(-x_1 - x_1)^2 + (y_1 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(2x_1)^2} = 2|x_1|
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4x_1^2\).

Since the points lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1\). Solving for \(y_1^2\), we get:
\[
y_1^2 = \frac{24}{20}x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24
\]
Since \(y_1^2\) must be non-negative, we have:
\[
\frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24 \geq 0 \implies \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 \geq 24 \implies x_1^2 \geq 20
\]
Therefore, the minimum value of \(x_1^2\) is 20. The maximum value of \(BD^2 = 4x_1^2\) is:
\[
4 \times 20 = 80

- Let \( A \) be the set of innbyggere who eier sukkertoyhjerter.
- Let \( B \) be the set of innbyggere who eier damantring.
- Let \( C \) be the set of innbyggere who eier et sett med golfkøller.
- Let \( D \) be the set of innbyggere who eier hagespade.
- Let \( E \) be the set of innbyggere who eier en pose.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of innbyggere is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of innbyggere who eier sukkertoyhjerter is \( |A| = 437 \).
- The number of innbyggere who eier damantring is \( |B| = 195 \).

- The number of innbyggere who eier nøyaktig to to av disse tingene is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D \cap E| = x \).

We need to find \( x \). According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D \cup E| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |A \cap E| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |B \cap E| - |C \cap D| - |C \cap E| - |D \cap E| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap E| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap E| + |A \cap D \cap E| + |B \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap E| + |B \cap D \cap E| + |C \cap D \cap E| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap E| - |A \cap B \cap D \cap E| - |A \cap C \cap D \cap E| - |B \cap C \cap D \cap E| + |A \cap B \cap C \cap D \cap E|
\]

Since \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D \cup E| = 900 \) and \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D \cap E| = x \), we can simplify the equation to:

\[
900 = 437 + 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - \left( \sum_{1 \le i < j < k < l < m \le 5} |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k \cap A_l \cap A_m| \right) + x

\sum_{1 \le i < j < k < l < m \le 5} |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k \cap A_l \cap A_m| = 900 - x

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[
900 = 1998 - (900 - x) + x

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
900 = 1998 - 900 + x + x

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the incenter \( I \) and the circumcenter \( O \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the triangle \( OAI \) is a right triangle with \( OI \) as one of the legs. The hypotenuse \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( IA \):
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) is the distance from the incenter to the side \( BC \), which is equal to the inradius \( r \). Therefore, we have:
\[
r = 2\sqrt{39} \implies 6 = 2\sqrt{39} \implies \sqrt{39} = 3 \implies 39 = 9

This step is incorrect, so let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the formula for the product of the sides of a triangle in terms of the circumradius and the inradius:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[

\]

We can simplify this to:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Next, we need to find non-negative integer solutions to this equation. Let's consider the case when one of the variables is zero. Without loss of generality, assume \(c = 0\). Then the equations become:

\[
a + b = 300,
\]
\[
100(ab) = 2,000,000.

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[
ab = 20,000.
\]

We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = 300\) and \(ab = 20,000\). These pairs are the roots of the quadratic equation:

\[
t^2 - 300t + 20,000 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):

\[
t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20,000}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]

This gives us the solutions:

\[
t = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \quad \text{and} \quad t = \frac{200}{2} = 100.
\]

So, the pairs \((a, b)\) are \((200, 100)\) and \((100, 200)\). Therefore, the corresponding triples \((a, b, c)\) are \((200, 100, 0)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\).

By symmetry, the pairs \((b, c)\) and \((c, a)\) will give us the triples \((100, 0, 200)\) and \((200, 0, 100)\), respectively. Thus, the four solutions are \((200, 100, 0)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), and \((200, 0, 100)\).

The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) where \(P\) is on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) is on the \(y\)-axis, and each segment has a length of 1.

First, let's parameterize the point \(C\) on the segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(C\) can be written as:
\[ C = (1-t)A + tB = (1-t)\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) + t\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right) \]
for some \(t \in [0, 1]\).

Next, we need to find the condition under which the segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with \(P = (p, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, q)\) has the same length as \(\overline{AB}\). The length of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[ AB = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2} - 0\right)^2 + \left(0 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = 1. \]
The length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[ PQ = \sqrt{p^2 + q^2}. \]
Setting \(PQ = AB\), we get:
\[ \sqrt{p^2 + q^2} = 1 \implies p^2 + q^2 = 1. \]

Now, we need to find the point \(C\) such that no other segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis and \(PQ = 1\) has the same coordinates as \(C\) except for \(\overline{AB}\). This means that \(C\) must satisfy:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2 = 1. \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = 1 \implies (1-t)^2 + 3t^2 = 4 \implies 1 - 2t + t^2 + 3t^2 = 4 \implies 4t^2 - 2t + 1 = 4 \implies 4t^2 - 2t - 3 = 0. \]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 4\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = -3\), we get:
\[ t = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 48}}{8} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{52}}{8} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{13}}{8} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{4}. \]
Since \(t\) must be in the interval \([0, 1]\), we take the positive root:
\[ t = \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{4}. \]
However, this value is greater than 1, so we take the other root:
\[ t = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{4}. \]
This value is less than 0, so we take the other root:
\[ t = \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{4}. \]
This value is greater than 1, so we take the other root:
\[ t = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{4}. \]
This value is less than 0, so we take the other root:
\[ t = \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{4}. \]

The coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[ C = \left(\frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{4}\right), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{4}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{4}\right) = \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8}\right). \]

The distance \(OC\) is:
\[ OC^2 = \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{(3 - \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39})^2}{64} = \frac{9 - 6\sqrt{13} + 13 + 3 + 2\sqrt{117} + 39}{64} = \frac{64}{64} = 1. \]

Thus, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{1}\), and \(p = 1\) and \(q = 1\). Therefore, \(p + q = 1 + 1 = 2\).

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, which means \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:

\[
(x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0
\]

Since \(\omega \neq 1\), \(\omega\) satisfies the equation:

\[
\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0
\]

We need to find the value of the product:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

First, we rewrite the expression inside the product:

\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}
\]

We can use the identity for the sum of a geometric series to simplify the product. Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 13th roots of unity except 1, i.e., \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
P(x) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k)
\]

We need to evaluate the product:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[
(2 - 2\omega^0 + \omega^{2 \cdot 0}) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

Now, we need to evaluate:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(P(x)\) can be written as:

\[
P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1
\]

We need to evaluate the polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) at the roots of \(P(x)\) and then take the product of these values. The polynomial \(Q(x)\) can be written as:

\[
Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2
\]

We need to find the product:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} Q(\omega^k)
\]

We can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial \(Q(x)\) at the roots of another polynomial \(P(x)\) is given by \(Q(0)^{12}\) if \(Q(x)\) is a polynomial of degree 2 and \(P(x)\) is a polynomial of degree 12. However, in this case, we can use the fact that the product of the values of \(Q(x)\) at the roots of \(P(x)\) is given by the constant term of \(Q(x)\) raised to the power of the degree of \(P(x)\) divided by the leading coefficient of \(P(x)\).

The constant term of \(Q(x)\) is 2, and the leading coefficient of \(P(x)\) is 1. Therefore, the product is:

\[
2^{12} = 4096
\]

However, we need to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. We have:

\[
4096 \mod 1000 = 96

"To determine the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than 20 \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the definition of a \( b \)-beautiful number. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) has exactly two digits in base \( b \), it can be written as \( \overline{ab}_b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the digits and \( 1 \le a < b \) (since \( a \) cannot be 0 for a two-digit number in base \( b \)). The value of \( n \) in decimal is \( ab + a \).

Given that \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful, we have:
\[ ab + a = \sqrt{n} \]
Since \( n = ab + a \), we substitute \( n \) in the equation:
\[ ab + a = \sqrt{ab + a} \]
Let \( x = ab + a \). Then the equation becomes:
\[ x = \sqrt{x} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ x^2 = x \]
\[ x(x - 1) = 0 \]
The solutions are \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 1 \). Since \( x = ab + a \) and \( a \ge 1 \), \( x \ge b + 1 \). Therefore, \( x = 1 \) is not possible. This means there are no \( b \)-beautiful numbers for any \( b \ge 2 \).

However, we need to re-evaluate the problem because the interpretation of the problem might have been incorrect. Let's consider the correct interpretation: \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

Let \( n = ab + a \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are the digits in base \( b \) and \( 1 \le a < b \). Then:
\[ ab + a = \sqrt{ab + a} \]
Let \( x = ab + a \). Then:
\[ x = \sqrt{x} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ x^2 = x \]
\[ x(x - 1) = 0 \]
The solutions are \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 1 \). Since \( x = ab + a \) and \( a \ge 1 \), \( x \ge b + 1 \). Therefore, \( x = 1 \) is not possible. This means there are no \( b \)-beautiful numbers for any \( b \ge 2 \).

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that there are no \( b \)-beautiful numbers for any \( b \ge 2 \).

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed by choosing two sides of a regular dodecagon such that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible combinations of its sides.

A regular dodecagon has 12 sides. A rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel sides from the dodecagon. Since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal and parallel, we need to count the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides.

First, we note that each side of the dodecagon is parallel to exactly one other side. Therefore, we can pair the sides of the dodecagon into 6 pairs of parallel sides.

To form a rectangle, we need to choose 2 out of these 6 pairs of parallel sides. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \).

The combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \) is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15

"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions and then calculate the sum of the squares of these integers. Let's break down the conditions step by step:

1. **Sum of the elements is 30:**
   The sum of all the integers in the list is 30.

2. **Unique mode is 9:**
   The number 9 appears more frequently in the list than any other number, and it is the only number that appears more frequently.

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list:**
   The median of the list is a positive integer that is not one of the elements in the list.

Let's start by considering the list. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's assume 9 appears \( k \) times in the list. The median will be the middle number if the list has an odd number of elements, or the average of the two middle numbers if the list has an even number of elements.

### Case 1: List has an odd number of elements
Let the list have \( 2m+1 \) elements. The median will be the \((m+1)\)-th element in the sorted list. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, it must be greater than 9.

Let's try to construct the list:
- The number 9 must appear at least \( m+1 \) times.
- The sum of the elements is 30, so the sum of the remaining \( 2m+1 - (m+1) = m \) elements must be \( 30 - 9(m+1) = 30 - 9m - 9 = 21 - 9m \).

To keep the elements positive and not equal to 9, let's try \( m = 2 \):
- The number 9 appears 3 times.
- The sum of the remaining 3 elements is \( 21 - 9 \cdot 2 = 3 \).
- The only positive integers that sum to 3 and are not 9 are 1 and 2. So, the list could be \( 9, 9, 9, 1, 2 \).

The median of this list is 9, which is not in the list, so this list satisfies all the conditions.

### Case 2: List has an even number of elements
Let the list have \( 2m \) elements. The median will be the average of the \( m \)-th and \((m+1)\)-th elements in the sorted list. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, it must be greater than 9.

Let's try to construct the list:
- The number 9 must appear at least \( m \) times.
- The sum of the elements is 30, so the sum of the remaining \( 2m - m = m \) elements must be \( 30 - 9m \).

To keep the elements positive and not equal to 9, let's try \( m = 2 \):
- The number 9 appears 2 times.
- The sum of the remaining 2 elements is \( 30 - 9 \cdot 2 = 12 \).
- The only positive integers that sum to 12 and are not 9 are 6 and 6. So, the list could be \( 9, 9, 6, 6 \).

The median of this list is \( \frac{6 + 6}{2} = 6 \), which is not in the list, so this list satisfies all the conditions.

Now, we need to calculate the sum of the squares of the elements in the list:
- For the list \( 9, 9, 9, 1, 2 \):
  \[
  9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 = 248
  \]
- For the list \( 9, 9, 6, 6 \):
  \[
  9^2 + 9^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 = 81 + 81 + 36 + 36 = 234

"To solve the problem, we need to find all possible ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the digits in each row is 999 and the sum of the digits in each column is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we have the following conditions:
1. The sum of the digits in each row is 999:
   \[
   a + b + c = 999
   \]
   \[
   d + e + f = 999
   \]
2. The sum of the digits in each column is 99:
   \[
   a + d = 99
   \]
   \[
   b + e = 99
   \]
   \[
   c + f = 99
   \]

We can express \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 99 - a
\]
\[
e = 99 - b
\]
\[
f = 99 - c

\[
a + b + c = 999

\[
(99 - a) + (99 - b) + (99 - c) = 999

Simplifying the second equation:
\[

Since \(a + b + c = 999\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
297 - 999 = 999

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = 1
\]

This equation is not possible, which means there must be a mistake in the interpretation or the problem setup. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\), we can proceed as follows:

From the equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other. Let's solve for \(x\):

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2} \implies x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

Substitute \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into the second equation:

\[
\frac{y}{(yz \sqrt{2})z} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \implies \frac{y}{yz^2 \sqrt{2}} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \implies \frac{1}{z^2 \sqrt{2}} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \implies z^2 = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{3}} \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{5}{6}}} \implies z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

Now substitute \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) back into the expression for \(x\):

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{6}{12} - \frac{5}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Now we have \(x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\) and \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\). We need to find \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}})^4 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12}} = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
y^3 = y^3
\]
\[
z^2 = (2^{-\frac{5}{12}})^2 = 2^{-\frac{10}{12}} = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]

So,

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot y^3 \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{\frac{2}{6} - \frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{3}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} = y^7 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y^7}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y^7}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}}
\]

Taking the absolute value and the logarithm base 2:

\[
\left|\log_2\left(\frac{y^7}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right)\right| = \left|\log_2(y^7) - \log_2(2^{\frac{1}{2}})\right| = \left|7 \log_2(y) - \frac{1}{2}\right|
\]

Since \(y\) is a positive real number, the expression inside the absolute value is not necessarily an integer, but we can express it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). However, the problem asks for the sum \(m+n\) where \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right| = \frac{m}{n}\) and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime.

"To find the length of the side of the regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, we start by noting that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. The side length of the hexagon is equal to the side length of these equilateral triangles.

Given that the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are forlengelser of segments of lengths 200, 240, and 300 respectively, we can use the fact that in a regular hexagon, the distance between two opposite sides (which is the same as the length of one side of the hexagon) is equal to the height of two equilateral triangles.

The height \(h\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by:
\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Since the distance between two opposite sides of the hexagon is the height of two equilateral triangles, it is:
\[ 2h = \sqrt{3} s \]

We know that this distance is the same as the length of the longest of the given segments, which is 300. Therefore, we have:

\[ s = \frac{300}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{300 \sqrt{3}}{3} = 100 \sqrt{3} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) and the set \( B \) that Bob lists. Bob lists all non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). Since Bob's list contains 2024 subsets, we need to determine the set \( A \) that corresponds to this number of subsets.

First, let's consider the number of non-empty subsets of a set with \( n \) elements. A set with \( n \) elements has \( 2^n \) subsets in total, including the empty subset. Therefore, the number of non-empty subsets is \( 2^n - 1 \).

We are given that Bob's list contains 2024 subsets, so we need to find \( n \) such that:
\[ 2^n - 1 = 2024 \]
Adding 1 to both sides, we get:
\[ 2^n = 2025 \]
We need to find the integer \( n \) such that \( 2^n = 2025 \). By calculating the powers of 2, we find:
\[ 2^{10} = 1024 \]
\[ 2^{11} = 2048 \]
Since \( 2025 \) is closer to \( 2048 \) than to \( 1024 \), we conclude that \( n = 11 \) is the correct value. Therefore, the set \( A \) must have 11 elements.

The sum of the elements in \( A \) is the sum of the first 11 positive integers, which is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]
Substituting \( n = 11 \), we get:

The difference between \( N \) and \( N' \) is:

\[ N - N' = d_i \cdot 10^{i-1} - 1 \cdot 10^{i-1} = (d_i - 1) \cdot 10^{i-1} \]

For \( N' \) to be divisible by 7, \( N - N' \) must be divisible by 7. Therefore, \( (d_i - 1) \cdot 10^{i-1} \) must be divisible by 7. Since 10 is not divisible by 7, \( d_i - 1 \) must be divisible by 7. The possible values for \( d_i \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The only values for \( d_i \) that satisfy \( d_i - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \) are \( d_i = 1 \) and \( d_i = 8 \).

To maximize \( N \), we should use the digit 8 as many times as possible. Let's consider the number \( N = 888 \ldots 888 \) with \( k \) digits. When we change any digit 8 to 1, the resulting number is \( 188 \ldots 888 \), \( 818 \ldots 888 \), \( 881 \ldots 888 \), etc. We need to check if any of these numbers is divisible by 7.

The number \( 188 \ldots 888 \) can be written as:

\[ 188 \ldots 888 = 8 \cdot \frac{10^k - 1}{9} + 1 \]

We need to find \( k \) such that \( 188 \ldots 888 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \). First, we find \( 10^k \pmod{7} \):

\[ 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10^4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10^5 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

The powers of 10 modulo 7 repeat every 6 terms. Therefore, \( 10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \) if \( k \) is a multiple of 6. Let \( k = 6m \) for some integer \( m \). Then:

\[ 188 \ldots 888 = 8 \cdot \frac{10^{6m} - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{1 - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

This is not divisible by 7. Let's try \( k = 6m + 1 \):

\[ 188 \ldots 888 = 8 \cdot \frac{10^{6m+1} - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{3 - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{2}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot 2 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]

This is not divisible by 7. Let's try \( k = 6m + 2 \):

\[ 188 \ldots 888 = 8 \cdot \frac{10^{6m+2} - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{2 - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot 1 + 1 \equiv 8 + 1 \equiv 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]

This is not divisible by 7. Let's try \( k = 6m + 3 \):

\[ 188 \ldots 888 = 8 \cdot \frac{10^{6m+3} - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{6 - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{5}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot 5 + 1 \equiv 40 + 1 \equiv 41 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

This is not divisible by 7. Let's try \( k = 6m + 4 \):

\[ 188 \ldots 888 = 8 \cdot \frac{10^{6m+4} - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{4 - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{3}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot 3 + 1 \equiv 24 + 1 \equiv 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

This is not divisible by 7. Let's try \( k = 6m + 5 \):

\[ 188 \ldots 888 = 8 \cdot \frac{10^{6m+5} - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{5 - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{4}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot 4 + 1 \equiv 32 + 1 \equiv 33 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

This is not divisible by 7. Let's try \( k = 6m + 6 \):

\[ 188 \ldots 888 = 8 \cdot \frac{10^{6m+6} - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 8 \cdot \frac{1 - 1}{9} + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

This is not divisible by 7. Therefore, the largest \( N \) is \( 888 \).

Now, we need to find \( Q \) and \( R \) when \( N = 888 \) is divided by 1000. We have:

\[ Q = \left\lfloor \frac{888}{1000} \right\rfloor = 0 \]
\[ R = 888 \]

Thus, \( Q + R = 0 + 888 = 888 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{888}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii of the circles of tangency of the torus \( T \) with the sphere \( S \) when the torus is external to the sphere. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

First, let's find the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere. The center of the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the circle, and the center of the sphere is at the origin. Therefore, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is 6 units.

Next, we need to find the points of tangency of the sphere with the torus. The sphere will be tangent to the torus at points where the distance from the center of the sphere to the surface of the torus is equal to the radius of the sphere. This distance is the sum of the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus and the radius of the torus at the point of tangency.

The radius of the torus at the point of tangency is the distance from the center of the circle to the surface of the torus, which is the radius of the circle plus the radius of the torus at that point. However, since the torus is external to the sphere, the radius of the torus at the point of tangency is simply the radius of the circle, which is 3 units.

Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \]

The radius of the circle of tangency of the sphere with the torus is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency minus the radius of the sphere:
\[ 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Thus, the radius of the circle of tangency \( r_i \) is 2 units, and the radius of the circle of tangency \( r_o \) is 2 units. The difference between these radii is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 2 - 2 = 0 \]

However, this result is incorrect because we need to consider the correct geometry of the problem. The correct approach is to use the fact that the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 units, and the radius of the sphere is 11 units. The correct radius of the circle of tangency \( r_i \) is:
\[ r_i = \sqrt{11^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{121 - 36} = \sqrt{85} \]

The correct radius of the circle of tangency \( r_o \) is:
\[ r_o = \sqrt{11^2 - 6^2} - 3 = \sqrt{85} - 3 \]

The difference between these radii is:
\[ r_i - r_o = \sqrt{85} - (\sqrt{85} - 3) = 3 \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[ m = 3, \quad n = 1 \]
\[ m + n = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To solve the problem, we need to place 25 white and 25 black squares in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that:

1. Each cell contains at most one square.
2. All squares in the same row and all squares in the same column have the same color.
3. Any additional square placed on the grid will break at least one of the first two conditions.

First, let's consider the implications of the conditions. If we place a square of a certain color in a cell, then all squares in the same row and all squares in the same column must be of that color. This means that each row and each column can contain at most one square of each color.

Given that there are 5 rows and 5 columns, and we need to place 25 squares (12.5 white and 12.5 black, but since we can't place half a square, we need to consider the integer constraints), we can place 5 white squares and 5 black squares in each row and each column. This is because if we place more than 5 squares of the same color in any row or column, it would violate the condition that each row and each column can contain at most one square of each color.

Now, let's consider the placement of the squares. If we place a white square in a cell, then all squares in the same row and all squares in the same column must be white. Similarly, if we place a black square in a cell, then all squares in the same row and all squares in the same column must be black.

This means that the placement of the squares is completely determined by the placement of the first square in the grid. If we place a white square in the top-left cell, then all squares in the first row and all squares in the first column must be white. If we place a black square in the top-left cell, then all squares in the first row and all squares in the first column must be black.

Therefore, there are only two possible ways to place the squares: either all squares are white or all squares are black. However, since we need to place 25 squares (12.5 white and 12.5 black, but since we can't place half a square, we need to consider the integer constraints), we need to consider the integer constraints. This means that we need to place 5 white squares and 5 black squares in each row and each column.

This is not possible with the given constraints, so we need to consider the integer constraints. Therefore, the number of ways to place the squares is 0.

Thus, the number of ways to place the squares is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",902,"[902, '902']",True
