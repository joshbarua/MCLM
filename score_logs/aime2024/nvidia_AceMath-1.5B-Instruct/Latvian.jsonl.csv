"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance \( d \) that Aja travels in terms of the speed \( s \) and the time \( t \) she spends traveling. We will use the information given in the problem to set up equations and then solve for \( d \).

First, let's write down the information provided:
1. When Aja travels at speed \( s \) km/h, she travels for 4 hours and 24 minutes (which is \( 4 + \frac{24}{60} = 4.4 \) hours) and covers a distance \( d \). The distance can be expressed as:
   \[
   d = s \times 4.4
   \]
2. When Aja travels at speed \( s + 2 \) km/h, she travels for 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours) and covers the same distance \( d \). The distance can be expressed as:
   \[
   d = (s + 2) \times 2.4
   \]

Since both expressions represent the same distance \( d \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
s \times 4.4 = (s + 2) \times 2.4
\]

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:
\[
4.4s = 2.4s + 4.8
\]

Subtracting \( 2.4s \) from both sides, we obtain:
\[
2s = 4.8
\]

Solving for \( s \), we get:
\[
s = 2.4
\]

Now that we have the value of \( s \), we can substitute it back into the expression for the distance \( d \):
\[
d = s \times 4.4 = 2.4 \times 4.4 = 10.56
\]

Next, we need to determine the distance \( d \) that Aja travels when she travels at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.4 + 0.5 = 2.9 \) km/h for \( t \) minutes. The time \( t \) is the same as the time she spent traveling at speed \( s + 2 \) km/h, which is 2.4 hours. Converting 2.4 hours to minutes, we get:
\[
2.4 \times 60 = 144 \text{ minutes}
\]

The distance \( d \) can be expressed as:
\[
d = 2.9 \times \frac{144}{60} = 2.9 \times 2.4 = 6.96
\]

Therefore, the distance that Aja travels when she travels at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h for \( t \) minutes is:
\[
\boxed{6.96}

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the area of triangle \(ABC\) using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]
The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
Next, we find the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\) using the formula:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]
The circumcircle \(\omega\) of triangle \(ABC\) has radius \(R = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}\). The point \(D\) is the intersection of the circumcircle with the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\), and the point \(P\) is the intersection of the line \(AD\) with the circumcircle again. By the properties of the circumcircle and the angle bisector, \(P\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\).

The length \(AP\) can be found using the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle:
\[
AP = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB+AC)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5+10)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{9}{25}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \cdot \frac{16}{25}} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]
Thus, \(AP = 4\sqrt{2}\). Since \(AP\) is a chord of the circumcircle, we can use the fact that the length of a chord is given by:
\[
AP = 2R \sin \angle BAC
\]
We already know \(R = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}\), and we can find \(\sin \angle BAC\) using the area formula:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A \implies 6\sqrt{14} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9 \cdot 10 \cdot \sin A \implies 6\sqrt{14} = 45 \sin A \implies \sin A = \frac{2\sqrt{14}}{15}
\]
Therefore:
\[
AP = 2 \cdot \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56} \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{14}}{15} = 2 \cdot \frac{75 \cdot 14}{56 \cdot 15} = 2 \cdot \frac{1050}{840} = 2 \cdot \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
The length \(AP\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), so \(m = 5\) and \(n = 2\). Thus, \(m + n = 5 + 2 = 7\).

\boxed{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly selected vertex of a regular polygon is not adjacent to any other selected vertices. Let's denote the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon by \( n \).

First, we need to count the total number of ways to select \( k \) vertices from \( n \) vertices such that no two selected vertices are adjacent. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or by using a combinatorial argument involving gaps.

The number of ways to select \( k \) vertices from \( n \) vertices such that no two selected vertices are adjacent is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n-k+1}{k} \). This is because we can think of placing \( k \) selected vertices in \( n-k+1 \) gaps created by the \( n-k \) non-selected vertices.

Next, we need to count the number of ways to select \( k \) vertices from \( n \) vertices such that at least one pair of selected vertices are adjacent. This can be done by subtracting the number of ways to select \( k \) vertices such that no two selected vertices are adjacent from the total number of ways to select \( k \) vertices.

The total number of ways to select \( k \) vertices from \( n \) vertices is \( \binom{n}{k} \). Therefore, the number of ways to select \( k \) vertices such that at least one pair of selected vertices are adjacent is \( \binom{n}{k} - \binom{n-k+1}{k} \).

The probability that a randomly selected vertex of a regular polygon is not adjacent to any other selected vertices is the ratio of the number of ways to select \( k \) vertices such that no two selected vertices are adjacent to the total number of ways to select \( k \) vertices. This probability is given by:

\[ \frac{\binom{n-k+1}{k}}{\binom{n}{k}} \]

For a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, the number of vertices \( n \) is equal to the number of sides. The problem states that the probability is \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers. We need to find the value of \( m+n \).

The probability that a randomly selected vertex of a regular polygon is not adjacent to any other selected vertices is \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \). The sum \( m+n \) is:

\[ m+n = 1+2 = 3 \]

"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2} \).
  - If \( x < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - x \).

  So, \( f(x) \) is a piecewise linear function with a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and a maximum value of 1 at \( x = \pm 1 \).

- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \).
  - If \( x < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \).

  So, \( g(x) \) is a piecewise linear function with a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and a maximum value of \(\frac{1}{4}\) at \( x = \pm 1 \).

Now, let's consider the functions \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- \( \sin(2\pi x) \) is a periodic function with period 1, and its range is \([-1, 1]\).
- \( \cos(3\pi y) \) is a periodic function with period \(\frac{2}{3}\), and its range is \([-1, 1]\).

Therefore, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \) are periodic functions with periods 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\), respectively.

Next, we need to find the number of intersection points of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation:
\[ 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]
or
\[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Since \( g(x) \) is symmetric about \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( f(x) \) is symmetric about \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), we can focus on the interval \([0, 1]\) for both \( x \) and \( y \).

In the interval \([0, 1]\), \( f(x) \) is a piecewise linear function with a minimum value of 0 at \( x = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1 \) and a maximum value of 1 at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \). The function \( g(x) \) is also a piecewise linear function with a minimum value of 0 at \( x = 0, \frac{1}{4} \) and a maximum value of \(\frac{1}{4}\) at \( x = \frac{1}{4} \).

The function \( g(f(x)) \) will have a minimum value of 0 at \( x = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1 \) and a maximum value of \(\frac{1}{4}\) at \( x = \frac{1}{4} \).

Since \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) are periodic functions with periods 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\), respectively, they will intersect at multiple points in the interval \([0, 1]\).

To find the exact number of intersection points, we need to consider the behavior of the functions over one period and then extend it to the entire domain. However, a detailed analysis of the functions and their intersections is complex and requires numerical methods or graphing tools.

Based on the symmetry and periodicity of the functions, we can conclude that the number of intersection points is 4.

Therefore, the number of intersection points of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), given that \( p \) is the smallest prime for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, it is more useful to consider the factorization over the integers modulo \( p \).

We know that there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}.
\]
This means that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8 but not a divisor of 4. Therefore, the order must be 8. This implies that 8 is the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( n^k \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \). Since \( p \) is the smallest prime for which there exists such an \( n \), we can use the fact that the order of \( m \) modulo \( p^2 \) must also be 8. The smallest positive integer \( m \) that satisfies this condition is \( m = p \).

To verify, we substitute \( m = p \) into the expression \( m^4 + 1 \):
\[
p^4 + 1.
\]
We need to check if \( p^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( p^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), we have:
\[
p^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}.
\]
This is not divisible by \( p^2 \). Therefore, \( m = p \) is not the correct answer.

The next smallest positive integer to check is \( m = p + 1 \). Substituting \( m = p + 1 \) into the expression \( m^4 + 1 \):
\[
(p+1)^4 + 1 = p^4 + 4p^3 + 6p^2 + 4p + 1 + 1 = p^4 + 4p^3 + 6p^2 + 4p + 2.

We need to check if \( p^4 + 4p^3 + 6p^2 + 4p + 2 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( p^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \) and \( 4p^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), we have:
\[
p^4 + 4p^3 + 6p^2 + 4p + 2 \equiv 6p^2 + 4p + 2 \pmod{p^2}.
\]
For \( 6p^2 + 4p + 2 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), the terms \( 4p + 2 \) must be divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( 4p + 2 \) is not divisible by \( p^2 \) for any prime \( p \), \( m = p + 1 \) is not the correct answer.

The next smallest positive integer to check is \( m = p + 2 \). Substituting \( m = p + 2 \) into the expression \( m^4 + 1 \):
\[
(p+2)^4 + 1 = p^4 + 8p^3 + 24p^2 + 32p + 16 + 1 = p^4 + 8p^3 + 24p^2 + 32p + 17.
\]
We need to check if \( p^4 + 8p^3 + 24p^2 + 32p + 17 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( p^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \) and \( 8p^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), we have:
\[
p^4 + 8p^3 + 24p^2 + 32p + 17 \equiv 24p^2 + 32p + 17 \pmod{p^2}.
\]
For \( 24p^2 + 32p + 17 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), the terms \( 32p + 17 \) must be divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( 32p + 17 \) is not divisible by \( p^2 \) for any prime \( p \), \( m = p + 2 \) is not the correct answer.

The next smallest positive integer to check is \( m = p + 3 \). Substituting \( m = p + 3 \) into the expression \( m^4 + 1 \):
\[

We need to check if \( p^4 + 12p^3 + 54p^2 + 108p + 82 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( p^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \) and \( 12p^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), we have:

\]
For \( 54p^2 + 108p + 82 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), the terms \( 108p + 82 \) must be divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( 108p + 82 \) is not divisible by \( p^2 \) for any prime \( p \), \( m = p + 3 \) is not the correct answer.

The next smallest positive integer to check is \( m = p + 4 \). Substituting \( m = p + 4 \) into the expression \( m^4 + 1 \):
\[

We need to check if \( p^4 + 16p^3 + 96p^2 + 256p + 257 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Since \( p^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \) and \( 16p^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), we have:
\[
p^4 + 16p^3 + 96p^2 + 256p + 257 \equiv 96p^2 + 256p + 257 \pmod{p^2}.

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to any of its faces, we start by calculating the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron and the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The distance from the incenter to any face is given by the formula \( \frac{3V}{S} \).

First, we use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( AB = a \), \( AC = b \), \( AD = c \), \( BC = d \), \( BD = e \), and \( CD = f \) is given by:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = \sqrt{80} \), \( e = \sqrt{41} \), and \( f = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 41 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
-25600
\]

The volume \( V \) is given by:

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{-\text{determinant}} = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{25600} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 160 = \frac{80}{3}
\]

Next, we calculate the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). The area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by Heron's formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

where \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \). For our triangle, \( s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \). However, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) can also be found using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)}
\]

Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24\sqrt{21} = 6\sqrt{21}
\]

Since the tetrahedron has four faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:

\[
S = 4 \cdot 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

Finally, the distance from the incenter to any face is:

\[
\frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{80}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{80}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{10}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{10\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]

Thus, \( m = 10 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \), and \( m + n + p = 10 + 21 + 63 = 94 \).

\[
\boxed{94}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum radius \( r \) of a sphere that can be inscribed in a tetrahedron with a volume of 54 and a surface area of 23. The radius \( r \) of the inscribed sphere (inradius) of a tetrahedron can be expressed in terms of its volume \( V \) and surface area \( A \) as follows:

\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} \]

Given that the volume \( V \) is 54 and the surface area \( A \) is 23, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ r = \frac{3 \times 54}{23} = \frac{162}{23} \]

The square of the radius \( r \) is:

\[ r^2 = \left( \frac{162}{23} \right)^2 = \frac{26244}{529} \]

Here, \( p = 26244 \) and \( q = 529 \) are both prime numbers. Therefore, the sum \( p + q \) is:

\[ p + q = 26244 + 529 = 26773 \]

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(x^{\log_x(y)} = y\). Therefore, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), where \(\log\) is the natural logarithm. Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Next, we apply the property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Similarly, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10\)
2. \(\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10\)

To eliminate the fractions, we multiply the first equation by \(\log(x)\) and the second equation by \(\log(y)\):

1. \(x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)\)
2. \(4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)\)

Next, we solve for \(\log(y)\) in terms of \(\log(x)\) from the first equation:

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

We substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \cdot \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\) (because \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]

Solving for \(y\), we get:

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now we substitute \(y = \frac{25}{x}\) back into the expression for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Using the property of logarithms again, we know that \(y = 10^{\log(y)}\), so:

\[
\log\left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = \log(25) - \log(x)
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\log(y)\), we get:

\[
\log(25) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[
\log(25) = \log(x) + \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Factoring out \(\log(x)\) on the right side, we get:

\[
\log(25) = \log(x) \left(1 + \frac{10}{x}\right)
\]

Solving for \(\log(x)\), we get:

\[
\log(x) = \frac{\log(25)}{1 + \frac{10}{x}} = \frac{\log(25) x}{x + 10}
\]

Exponentiating both sides, we get:

\[
x = 10^{\frac{\log(25) x}{x + 10}}
\]

Since \(10^{\log(25)} = 25\), we can rewrite the right side as:

\[
x = 25^{\frac{x}{x + 10}}
\]

To find a solution, we test \(x = 5\):

\[
5 = 25^{\frac{5}{5 + 10}} = 25^{\frac{5}{15}} = 25^{\frac{1}{3}} = 5
\]

So, \(x = 5\) is a solution. Substituting \(x = 5\) back into the expression for \(y\), we get:

\[
y = \frac{25}{5} = 5
\]

Finally, we calculate \(xy\):

\[
xy = 5 \cdot 5 = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that Bob can guarantee that Alise will not win the game, given that Bob can remove either 1 or 4 vertices on his turn and Alise can remove either 1 or 4 vertices on her turn, with the player who removes the last vertex winning.

First, let's analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win. Conversely, a position is a losing position if any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We start by identifying the base cases:
- If there is 1 vertex left, the player who is about to move wins by removing it.
- If there are 4 vertices left, the player who is about to move wins by removing all of them.

Next, we consider the positions with more vertices:
- If there are 2 vertices left, the player who is about to move loses because they can only remove 1 vertex, leaving 1 vertex for the opponent, who then wins.
- If there are 3 vertices left, the player who is about to move loses because they can only remove 1 vertex, leaving 2 vertices for the opponent, who then loses.
- If there are 5 vertices left, the player who is about to move wins by removing 4 vertices, leaving 1 vertex for the opponent, who then loses.
- If there are 6 vertices left, the player who is about to move wins by removing 4 vertices, leaving 2 vertices for the opponent, who then loses.
- If there are 7 vertices left, the player who is about to move loses because they can only remove 1 vertex, leaving 6 vertices for the opponent, who then loses.
- If there are 8 vertices left, the player who is about to move wins by removing 4 vertices, leaving 4 vertices for the opponent, who then loses.

From this pattern, we can see that the losing positions are the numbers that are congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5. Therefore, the winning positions are the numbers that are congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 5.

We need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \) is not a losing position and is greater than 2024. The smallest such \( n \) is the smallest number greater than 2024 that is congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 5.

First, we find the remainder when 2024 is divided by 5:
\[ 2024 \div 5 = 404 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
So, \( 2024 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).

The next number greater than 2024 that is congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 5 is 2025. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that Bob can guarantee to win the game is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the three numbers chosen by Viņa are not the three largest numbers in the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the three numbers chosen by Viņa are not the three largest numbers in the set \( S \).

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from the set \( S \). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{3} \):
\[
\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 3 numbers from the set \( S \) such that they are not the three largest numbers. The three largest numbers in the set \( S \) are \( 8, 9, \) and \( 10 \). Therefore, we need to count the number of ways to choose 3 numbers from the set \( S \) that do not include all of \( 8, 9, \) and \( 10 \).

The total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from the set \( S \) that include all of \( 8, 9, \) and \( 10 \) is 1 (the set \( \{8, 9, 10\} \)). Therefore, the number of ways to choose 3 numbers from the set \( S \) that do not include all of \( 8, 9, \) and \( 10 \) is:
\[
\binom{10}{3} - 1 = 120 - 1 = 119
\]

Thus, the probability that the three numbers chosen by Viņa are not the three largest numbers in the set \( S \) is:
\[
\frac{119}{120}
\]

The fraction \( \frac{119}{120} \) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 119 \) and \( n = 120 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 119 + 120 = 239 \).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of similar triangles and the fact that the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, as are the points \(A, D, H, G\).

First, let's consider the triangles \(ABD\) and \(EFC\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the triangles \(ABD\) and \(EFC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. This is because \(\angle ABD = \angle EFC\) (both are vertical angles) and \(\angle BAD = \angle CEF\) (corresponding angles of similar triangles).

The similarity ratio of the triangles \(ABD\) and \(EFC\) is equal to the ratio of the corresponding sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{EF} = \frac{BD}{FC}
\]
Given \(AB = 107\) and \(EF = 184\), we can write:
\[
\frac{107}{184} = \frac{BD}{FC}
\]

Next, let's consider the triangles \(ADH\) and \(FGH\). Since \(A, D, H, G\) are collinear, the triangles \(ADH\) and \(FGH\) are also similar by the AA similarity criterion. This is because \(\angle ADH = \angle FGH\) (both are vertical angles) and \(\angle DAH = \angle HFG\) (corresponding angles of similar triangles).

The similarity ratio of the triangles \(ADH\) and \(FGH\) is equal to the ratio of the corresponding sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{AD}{FG} = \frac{DH}{GH}
\]
Given \(AD = BC = 16\) and \(FG = 17\), we can write:
\[
\frac{16}{17} = \frac{DH}{GH}
\]

Now, let's denote the length of \(CE\) as \(x\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the length \(FC\) is the sum of the lengths \(EF\) and \(CE\):
\[
FC = EF + CE = 184 + x
\]

Using the similarity ratio of the triangles \(ABD\) and \(EFC\), we have:
\[
\frac{107}{184} = \frac{BD}{184 + x}
\]
Since \(BD = BC = 16\), we substitute \(BD\) with 16:
\[
\frac{107}{184} = \frac{16}{184 + x}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
107(184 + x) = 16 \cdot 184
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
19528 + 107x = 2944
\]
Subtracting 19528 from both sides, we get:
\[
107x = 2944 - 19528
\]
\[
107x = -16584
\]
Dividing both sides by 107, we get:
\[
x = \frac{-16584}{107} = -155.56
\]

However, since \(x\) represents a length, it must be positive. Therefore, we re-evaluate the problem and find that the correct interpretation should be:
\[
\frac{107}{184} = \frac{16}{184 - x}
\]
Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
107(184 - x) = 16 \cdot 184
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
19528 - 107x = 2944
\]
Subtracting 19528 from both sides, we get:
\[
-107x = 2944 - 19528
\]
\[
-107x = -16584
\]
Dividing both sides by -107, we get:
\[
x = \frac{16584}{107} = 155.56

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place a 4x4 square on an 8x8 chessboard such that the square is centered on a black square. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the centering condition:**
   - A 4x4 square centered on a black square means that the top-left corner of the 4x4 square must be on a black square.
   - On an 8x8 chessboard, the black squares are arranged in a checkerboard pattern. The black squares are the squares with coordinates (i, j) where i + j is even.

2. **Determine the possible positions for the top-left corner:**
   - The top-left corner of the 4x4 square can be any black square in the top-left 5x5 subgrid of the 8x8 chessboard. This is because the 4x4 square must fit entirely within the 8x8 chessboard.
   - The top-left corner can be in any of the black squares in the first 5 rows and the first 5 columns. The black squares in the first 5 rows and the first 5 columns are:

     - (2,2), (2,4)
     - (3,1), (3,3), (3,5)
     - (4,2), (4,4)
     - (5,1), (5,3), (5,5)

3. **Count the number of black squares in the first 5 rows and the first 5 columns:**
   - There are 3 black squares in the first row.
   - There are 2 black squares in the second row.
   - There are 3 black squares in the third row.
   - There are 2 black squares in the fourth row.
   - There are 3 black squares in the fifth row.
   - Adding these together, we get:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)

2. Two of the pieskaras with a radius of 34, \(AB\) and \(BC\), are tangent to each other.

First, let's denote the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) by \(r\). The formula for the inradius \(r\) of a triangle with area \(K\) and semi-perimeter \(s\) is given by:
\[ r = \frac{K}{s} \]

Since the pieskaras with a radius of 34 are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers is 68. This distance is also the length of side \(AC\) of triangle \(ABC\). The pieskaras with a radius of 1 are tangent to the sides of the triangle, so the sides of the triangle are tangent to these smaller circles.

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The diagonals of the rhombus \(ABCD\) intersect at the center of the hyperbola, which is the origin \((0,0)\). Let the vertices of the rhombus be \(A(x_1, y_1)\), \(B(x_2, y_2)\), \(C(x_3, y_3)\), and \(D(x_4, y_4)\). Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the coordinates of the vertices can be expressed in terms of the center and the lengths of the diagonals.

The diagonals of the rhombus are the segments connecting opposite vertices. Let the lengths of the diagonals be \(2a\) and \(2b\). The vertices of the rhombus can be written as:
\[ A(a, b), \quad B(-a, b), \quad C(-a, -b), \quad D(a, -b) \]

Since these points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Substituting \(x = a\) and \(y = b\) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \]

We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\). The length of \(BD\) is the distance between the points \(B(-a, b)\) and \(D(a, -b)\):
\[ BD = \sqrt{(a - (-a))^2 + (-b - b)^2} = \sqrt{(2a)^2 + (-2b)^2} = \sqrt{4a^2 + 4b^2} = 2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]
Thus,
\[ BD^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2) \]

From the hyperbola equation, we can express \(b^2\) in terms of \(a^2\):
\[ \frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{b^2}{24} = \frac{a^2}{20} - 1 \implies b^2 = 24 \left( \frac{a^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{6a^2}{5} - 24 \]

Substituting \(b^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[ BD^2 = 4 \left( a^2 + \frac{6a^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{5a^2}{5} + \frac{6a^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{11a^2}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{44a^2}{5} - 96 \]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(\frac{44a^2}{5} - 96\). Since \(a^2\) can take any positive value, the term \(\frac{44a^2}{5}\) can become arbitrarily large. However, we are asked to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) that is less than the maximum possible value, which is the value when \(a^2\) is as large as possible but still finite. The maximum value of \(BD^2\) is the value when \(a^2\) is as large as possible, which is the value when \(a^2\) is as large as possible but still finite.

The maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:

"To find the number of iedzīvotāji, kuriem pieder visas četras šīs lietas, we need to determine the number of iedzīvotāji that are not among the 900 iedzīvotāji, 437 iedzīvotāji, and 234 iedzīvotāji. Let's denote the total number of iedzīvotāji by \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- The number of iedzīvotāji that pieder dimanta gredzens is 195.
- The number of iedzīvotāji that pieder golfa nūju komplekts is 367.
- The number of iedzīvotāji that pieder dārza lāpsta is 562.
- The number of iedzīvotāji that pieder maisiņš ar konfekšu sirsniņām is 437.
- The number of iedzīvotāji that pieder tieši divas no šīm lietām is 234.

Since these four sets of iedzīvotāji are distinct, the total number of iedzīvotāji that pieder at least one of these four events is:
\[ 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 = 1561 \]

However, the total number of iedzīvotāji \( N \) must be greater than or equal to 1561 because these four sets are subsets of the total set of iedzīvotāji. The number of iedzīvotāji that pieder none of these four events is the total number of iedzīvotāji minus the number of iedzīvotāji that pieder at least one of these four events. Since the number of iedzīvotāji that pieder none of these four events is not specified, we assume it is 0 for the purpose of finding the number of iedzīvotāji that pieder all four events.

Therefore, the number of iedzīvotāji that pieder all four events is:
\[ N - 1561 \]

Since the problem asks for the number of iedzīvotāji that pieder all four events, and we do not have the exact value of \( N \), we assume that the number of iedzīvotāji that pieder all four events is the number of iedzīvotāji that pieder none of these four events, which is 0.

Thus, the number of iedzīvotāji that pieder all four events is:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) has an apollonius center \( O \) and an incenter \( I \) such that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), and the apollonius radius is 13 and the inradius is 6, we need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall that the apollonius center \( O \) is the point where the internal angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and the apollonius radius is the distance from \( O \) to any side of the triangle. The incenter \( I \) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and the inradius is the distance from \( I \) to any side of the triangle.

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the points \( A \), \( O \), and \( I \) form a right triangle with \( OI \) as one of the legs. The apollonius radius is the distance from \( O \) to \( A \), which is 13, and the inradius is the distance from \( I \) to \( A \), which is 6. Therefore, the hypotenuse \( OA \) of this right triangle is the distance from \( O \) to \( I \), which is \( \sqrt{13^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{169 - 36} = \sqrt{133} \).

The distance \( OI \) is \( \sqrt{133} \). The apollonius center \( O \) is the incenter of the triangle formed by the excenters of \( \triangle ABC \), and the distance from the incenter to the excenter is given by \( \frac{R}{R - 2r} \), where \( R \) is the circumradius and \( r \) is the inradius. However, for the incenter of the original triangle, the distance to the excenter is \( \frac{R}{R - 2r} \), and the distance from the incenter to the apollonius center is \( \frac{R}{R - 2r} \).

The product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides and inradius:
\[ \text{Area} = r \cdot s, \]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. The area can also be expressed as:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin BAC. \]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[ r \cdot s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin BAC. \]
Since \( \sin BAC = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area}}{AB \cdot AC} \), we can substitute \( \sin BAC \) in the equation:
\[ r \cdot s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area}}{AB \cdot AC} = \text{Area}. \]
Therefore, we have:
\[ r \cdot s = \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin BAC. \]
Since \( \sin BAC = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area}}{AB \cdot AC} \), we can substitute \( \sin BAC \) in the equation:
\[ r \cdot s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area}}{AB \cdot AC} = \text{Area}. \]
Therefore, we have:
\[ r \cdot s = \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin BAC. \]
Since \( \sin BAC = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area}}{AB \cdot AC} \), we can substitute \( \sin BAC \) in the equation:
\[ r \cdot s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \frac{2 \cdot \text{Area}}{AB \cdot AC} = \text{Area}. \]

The product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To find the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the second equation. Notice that we can factor the left-hand side as follows:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]

Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we can substitute this into the equation to get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]

Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we find:

\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We can express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\) from the first equation:

\[
c = 300 - a - b.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we have:

\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation in \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]

To find the integer solutions, we can use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are non-negative integers and \(a + b + c = 300\). We can test possible values for \(a\) and solve for \(b\) and \(c\).

First, let's assume \(a = 100\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
100^2 + b^2 + 100b - 300 \cdot 100 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
10,000 + b^2 - 200b - 10,000 + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b + 20,000 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\), where \(A = 1\), \(B = -200\), and \(C = 20,000\), we get:

\[
b = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{200^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20,000}}{2 \cdot 1},
\]
\[
b = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{40,000 - 80,000}}{2},
\]
\[
b = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{0}}{2},
\]
\[
b = 100.
\]

So, \(b = 100\) and \(c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100\). Therefore, one solution is \((100, 100, 100)\).

By symmetry, the permutations of \((100, 100, 100)\) are also solutions, which are \((100, 100, 100)\), \((100, 100, 100)\), and \((100, 100, 100)\). There is only one distinct solution.

Thus, the number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given conditions is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) on segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that the distance \(OC\) is minimized, where \(O\) is the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), and \(B\) is \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). Point \(C\) is not on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) but is the point on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) (the line passing through \(A\) and \(B\)) that minimizes the distance to the origin.

First, we find the equation of the line \(AB\). The slope of \(AB\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with point \(A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
This is the equation of line \(AB\).

The point \(C\) that minimizes the distance to the origin lies on the line passing through the origin and perpendicular to \(AB\). The slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of \(-\sqrt{3}\), which is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\). Using the point-slope form with the origin \((0,0)\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]
To find the coordinates of \(C\), we solve the system of equations:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]
Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Adding \(\sqrt{3}x\) to both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Dividing both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{4}{3}x = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

Next, we calculate the distance \(OC\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{12}{64} = \frac{3}{16}
\]
Therefore, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), and \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, i.e., \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the 13th roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 13}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

We can use the fact that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) to simplify the expression. Notice that \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). However, a more straightforward approach is to consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of this polynomial are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We can rewrite the product as:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k).\]

Since \(P(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\), we have:
\[P(\omega^k) = \frac{(\omega^k)^{13} - 1}{\omega^k - 1} = \frac{1 - 1}{\omega^k - 1} = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12.\]

However, we need to consider the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). This can be rewritten as:
\[2^{13} - 2 \sum_{k=1}^{12} \omega^k + \sum_{k=1}^{12} \omega^{2k}.\]

Since \(\sum_{k=1}^{12} \omega^k = -1\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{12} \omega^{2k} = -1\), we have:
\[2^{13} - 2(-1) + (-1) = 8192 + 2 - 1 = 8193.\]

However, we need to consider the product modulo 1000. Therefore, we have:
\[8193 \mod 1000 = 193.\]

Thus, the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) modulo 1000 is \(\boxed{193}\).","[193, '193']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To find the smallest \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than 10 \( b \)-skaistus, we need to determine the number of \( b \)-skaistus for each \( b \) and then find the smallest \( b \) for which this number exceeds 10.

A \( b \)-skaistu is a number \( n \) such that \( n \) has two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits is at least \( \sqrt{n} \). Let's denote the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( a \) and \( c \), where \( 0 \le a, c < b \) and \( a \neq 0 \). Then, \( n = ab + c \) and the condition becomes \( a + c \ge \sqrt{ab + c} \).

First, let's consider the range of \( n \). Since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it satisfies \( b^2 \le n < b^3 \). Therefore, \( b^2 \le ab + c < b^3 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to identify the taisnstūri that can be formed by a regular 12-stud mitre, where each taisnstūra mala is either at the same level as the base, above the base, or below the base, and also at the same level as the diagonal, above the diagonal, or below the diagonal.

First, let's consider the structure of a regular 12-stud mitre. A regular 12-stud mitre can be visualized as a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) with each side extended to form a mitre. The taisnstūri are the points where the mitre intersects the sides of the dodecagon or the diagonals of the dodecagon.

The key is to determine which of these taisnstūri are visible from the top view. In the top view, the taisnstūri that are at the same level as the base, above the base, or above the diagonal, and also at the same level as the diagonal, above the diagonal, are the ones that are visible.

From the diagram, we can see that the taisnstūri that are visible are the ones at the vertices of the dodecagon and the points where the mitre intersects the diagonals. These points form a smaller dodecagon inside the original dodecagon.

The number of taisnstūri that are visible is the number of vertices of the smaller dodecagon, which is 12. However, the problem states that there are only three taisnstūri that are visible. This implies that the smaller dodecagon is actually a regular hexagon, and the taisnstūri that are visible are the vertices of the hexagon.

Therefore, the number of taisnstūri that can be formed is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",315,"[315, '315']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the squares of the elements of the set of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the conditions:**
   - The sum of the elements is 30.
   - The unique mode is 9.
   - The median is a positive integer that is not one of the elements in the set.

2. **Determine the number of elements in the set:**
   Since the mode is 9 and it is unique, the number of elements in the set must be odd (because if it were even, 9 would not be the unique mode). Let's denote the number of elements by \( n \).

3. **Construct the set:**
   - The mode is 9, so 9 must appear more frequently than any other number.
   - The sum of the elements is 30.
   - The median is a positive integer that is not 9.

4. **Consider the smallest possible set:**
   Let's start with the smallest odd number of elements, which is 5. If \( n = 5 \), the median is the third element when the elements are arranged in ascending order. Let's denote the elements by \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \) such that \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq a_4 \leq a_5 \). The median is \( a_3 \), and it must be a positive integer that is not 9.

5. **Set up the equations:**
   - \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \)
   - \( a_1, a_2, a_4, a_5 \) are not 9, and \( a_3 \) is 9.
   - \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq 9 \leq a_4 \leq a_5 \)

6. **Choose values for \( a_1, a_2, a_4, a_5 \):**
   To minimize the sum of the squares, we should choose the smallest possible values for \( a_1, a_2, a_4, a_5 \) that satisfy the conditions. Let's try \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 2 \). Then:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \implies a_4 + a_5 = 18
   \]
   Since \( a_4 \geq 9 \) and \( a_5 \geq 9 \), the smallest possible values for \( a_4 \) and \( a_5 \) are 9 and 9, respectively. However, this would make the median 9, which is not allowed. Therefore, we need to choose \( a_4 = 9 \) and \( a_5 = 9 \), but this is not possible because the median would be 9.

   4 + 5 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \implies a_4 + a_5 = 12
   \]
   The smallest possible values for \( a_4 \) and \( a_5 \) are 9 and 3, respectively. This gives us the set \( \{4, 5, 9, 9, 3\} \). The median is 9, which is not allowed.

   Let's try \( a_1 = 4 \) and \( a_2 = 6 \). Then:

"To solve the problem, we need to find a 3x3 grid of digits such that the sum of the digits in each row and each column is 999 and 99, respectively. The grid is given as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We need to fill in the remaining cells of the grid to satisfy the conditions. Let's denote the unknown cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the digits in the first row and the first column:
- The sum of the digits in the first row is \(0 + 0 + 8 = 8\).
- The sum of the digits in the first column is \(0 + 9 + a = 9 + a\).

Since the sum of the digits in the first row must be 999, we have:
\[9 + a = 999 \implies a = 990.\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the digits in the second row and the second column:
- The sum of the digits in the second row is \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\).
- The sum of the digits in the second column is \(0 + 9 + b = 9 + b\).

Since the sum of the digits in the second row must be 999, we have:
\[9 + b = 999 \implies b = 990.\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the digits in the third row and the third column:
- The sum of the digits in the third row is \(a + b + c = 990 + 990 + c = 1980 + c\).
- The sum of the digits in the third column is \(8 + 1 + c = 9 + c\).

Since the sum of the digits in the third row must be 99, we have:
\[1980 + c = 99 \implies c = 99 - 1980 = -1881.\]

However, this value is not a valid digit (since digits must be between 0 and 9). Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for a 3x3 grid of digits such that the sum of the digits in each row and each column is 999 and 99, respectively, and the given grid is a part of the solution.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct grid is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\
\hline
990 & 990 & -1881 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

However, since the problem is asking for a valid 3x3 grid of digits, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for a 3x3 grid of digits such that the sum of the digits in each row and each column is 999 and 99, respectively, and the given grid is a part of the solution.

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Since \(1 = 2^0\), we equate the exponents:

\[
0 = \frac{13}{12}
\]

This equation is not possible, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the value of \(x^4 y^3 z^2\), we can use the original equations to express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other.

From \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we get:

\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

We can substitute \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
y = (yz \sqrt{2}) z 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Since \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[
1 = z^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Solving for \(z^2\):

\[
z^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{5}{6}}}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

Now, substitute \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) back into \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\):

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12} + \frac{6}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Finally, substitute \(x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\) and \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) into \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = \left(y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\right)^4 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12}} = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
y^3 = y^3
\]
\[
z^2 = \left(2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\right)^2 = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]

So,

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot y^3 \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{3}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} = y^7 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y^7}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y^7}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}}
\]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{5}{12}}}\), we substitute \(y\) back:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2^{\frac{5}{12}}}\right)^7}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{35}{12}}} \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{35}{12} + \frac{6}{12}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{41}{12}}}
\]

The value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is:

\[
\left|\log_2\left(\frac{1}{2^{\frac{41}{12}}}\right)\right| = \left|-\frac{41}{12}\right| = \frac{41}{12}
\]

Thus, \(m = 41\) and \(n = 12\), and \(m + n = 53\). The answer is:

"To find the length of the sešstūra malas garums, we need to use the fact that the sešstūra malas pretējo malas pāri are parallel and that the sešstūra malas form a closed figure with the given side lengths of the triangular faces.

Given:
- The lengths of the sides of the triangular face are \( AB = 200 \), \( CD = 240 \), and \( EF = 300 \).

Since the sešstūra malas pretējo malas pāri are parallel, the sešstūra can be divided into two parts: a triangular base and a triangular top, with the sides of the top triangle being parallel to the sides of the base triangle.

The sešstūra sešstūra malas garums can be found by summing the lengths of all the sešstūra sides. The sešstūra has 6 sides, and we know the lengths of 3 of them (the sides of the triangular face). The other 3 sides are parallel to these sides and have the same lengths.

Therefore, the total length of the sešstūra sešstūra malas garums is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find a set \( A \) of positive integers such that the set \( B \) of positive integers that are not in \( A \) and whose maximum element is less than or equal to the maximum element of \( A \) has 2024 elements. We need to determine the sum of the elements in \( A \).

First, let's denote the maximum element of \( A \) by \( n \). The set \( B \) will then contain all positive integers from 1 to \( n \) that are not in \( A \). Since \( B \) has 2024 elements, the number of elements in \( A \) is \( n - 2024 \).

The sum of the elements in \( A \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers minus the sum of the elements in \( B \). The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by:
\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

The sum of the elements in \( B \) is the sum of the first \( n - 2024 \) positive integers, which is:
\[
\frac{(n-2024)(n-2023)}{2}
\]

Therefore, the sum of the elements in \( A \) is:
\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \frac{(n-2024)(n-2023)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1) - (n-2024)(n-2023)}{2}
\]

Expanding the expression inside the numerator, we get:
\[
n(n+1) = n^2 + n
\]
\[
(n-2024)(n-2023) = n^2 - 4047n + 2024 \cdot 2023
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{n^2 + n - (n^2 - 4047n + 2024 \cdot 2023)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n - n^2 + 4047n - 2024 \cdot 2023}{2} = \frac{4048n - 2024 \cdot 2023}{2} = 2024n - 2024 \cdot 2023 = 2024(n - 2023)
\]

Thus, the sum of the elements in \( A \) is:
\[
2024(n - 2023)
\]

To find the specific value of \( n \), we need to ensure that \( B \) has exactly 2024 elements, which means \( n - 2024 = 2024 \), so \( n = 4048 \). Substituting \( n = 4048 \) into the expression, we get:
\[
2024(4048 - 2023) = 2024 \cdot 2025 = 4098600

Therefore, the sum of the elements in \( A \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest four-digit positive integer \( N \) that satisfies the condition that any permutation of its digits, when interpreted as a number, is divisible by 7. Additionally, we need to find integers \( Q \) and \( R \) such that \( N \) is divisible by 1000, and then find \( Q + R \).

First, let's consider the divisibility rule for 7. A number is divisible by 7 if and only if the number itself is divisible by 7. Therefore, any permutation of the digits of \( N \) must be divisible by 7.

The smallest four-digit number is 1000, but 1000 is not divisible by 7. The next number to check is 1001. Let's verify if 1001, 1010, 1100, 0101, 0110, 0011, 1101, 1011, and 0111 are all divisible by 7:
- \( 1001 \div 7 = 143 \) (divisible by 7)
- \( 1010 \div 7 = 144.2857 \) (not divisible by 7)

Since 1010 is not divisible by 7, 1001 is not the number we are looking for. We need to find the next number that satisfies the condition. Let's check the next few numbers:
- \( 1002 \div 7 = 143.1429 \) (not divisible by 7)
- \( 1003 \div 7 = 143.2857 \) (not divisible by 7)
- \( 1004 \div 7 = 143.4286 \) (not divisible by 7)
- \( 1005 \div 7 = 143.5714 \) (not divisible by 7)
- \( 1006 \div 7 = 143.7143 \) (not divisible by 7)
- \( 1007 \div 7 = 143.8571 \) (not divisible by 7)
- \( 1008 \div 7 = 144 \) (divisible by 7)

So, 1008 is divisible by 7. Let's check the permutations of 1008:
- \( 1008 \div 7 = 144 \) (divisible by 7)
- \( 1080 \div 7 = 154.2857 \) (not divisible by 7)
- \( 1800 \div 7 = 257.1429 \) (not divisible by 7)
- \( 8001 \div 7 = 1143 \) (divisible by 7)
- \( 8100 \div 7 = 1157.1429 \) (not divisible by 7)

Since 8100 is not divisible by 7, 8001 is the only other number that is divisible by 7. Therefore, the number \( N \) must be 1008 or 8001. However, 8001 is not a four-digit number, so \( N \) must be 1008.

Next, we need to find integers \( Q \) and \( R \) such that \( N = 1008 \) is divisible by 1000, and then find \( Q + R \). Since 1008 is not divisible by 1000, we need to find the next number that is divisible by 1000 and satisfies the condition. The next number is 10000, but it is not a four-digit number. Therefore, we need to find the next number that is divisible by 1000 and satisfies the condition. The next number is 10000, but it is not a four-digit number. Therefore, we need to find the next number that is divisible by 1000 and satisfies the condition. The next number is 10000, but it is not a four-digit number.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio \( \frac{r_i}{r_o} \) where \( r_i \) is the radius of the inscribed sphere and \( r_o \) is the radius of the circumscribed sphere of the torus \( T \), and then find \( m + n \) where \( \frac{r_i}{r_o} = \frac{m}{n} \) and \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers.

First, let's analyze the geometry of the torus \( T \). The torus has a major radius \( R = 3 \) (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and a minor radius \( r = 1 \) (the radius of the tube). The torus is inscribed in a sphere \( S \) with radius \( R_S = 11 \).

### Step 1: Calculate the radius of the circumscribed sphere \( r_o \)
The circumscribed sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11. The distance from the center of the torus to any point on the surface of the torus is the sum of the major radius and the minor radius, which is \( R + r = 3 + 1 = 4 \). The radius of the circumscribed sphere \( r_o \) is the distance from the center of the torus to the farthest point on the surface of the torus, which is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 4 and 11. Therefore, we have:
\[
r_o = \sqrt{4^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{16 + 121} = \sqrt{137}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the radius of the inscribed sphere \( r_i \)
The inscribed sphere \( T \) is tangent to the inner surface of the torus and the outer surface of the torus. The distance from the center of the torus to the inner surface of the torus is \( R - r = 3 - 1 = 2 \). The radius of the inscribed sphere \( r_i \) is the distance from the center of the torus to the inner surface of the torus, which is 2. Therefore, we have:
\[
r_i = 2

### Step 3: Calculate the ratio \( \frac{r_i}{r_o} \)
Now, we can find the ratio of the radius of the inscribed sphere to the radius of the circumscribed sphere:
\[
\frac{r_i}{r_o} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{137}}
\]

### Step 4: Rationalize the denominator
To express the ratio in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers, we rationalize the denominator:
\[
\frac{2}{\sqrt{137}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{137}}{137}
\]
Here, \( m = 2 \sqrt{137} \) and \( n = 137 \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 2 + 137 = 139
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{139}

"To solve the problem, we need to create a \(5 \times 5\) grid where each \(5 \times 5\) subgrid contains exactly one of each of the 25 ""baltām"" and 25 ""melnām"" characters, and each row and each column contains exactly one of each character from both categories. Additionally, each ""pārkāptu"" character that is removed from the grid must leave at least one ""baltām"" and one ""melnām"" character in each \(5 \times 5\) subgrid.

First, let's denote the characters as follows:
- ""B"" for ""baltām""
- ""M"" for ""melnām""
- ""P"" for ""pārkāptu""

We need to ensure that each \(5 \times 5\) subgrid has exactly one ""B"", one ""M"", and one ""P"" in each row and each column. This means that each ""pārkāptu"" character must be placed such that it does not create a \(5 \times 5\) subgrid that is missing either a ""B"" or an ""M"".

One way to achieve this is to place the ""pārkāptu"" characters in a pattern that ensures each \(5 \times 5\) subgrid still contains at least one ""B"" and one ""M"". One such pattern is to place the ""pārkāptu"" characters in the positions where the row and column indices sum to a multiple of 5. This will ensure that each \(5 \times 5\) subgrid contains exactly one ""B"" and one ""M"" in each row and each column.

Here is one possible arrangement:

\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
B & M & P & M & B \\
M & B & M & B & M \\
P & M & B & M & P \\
M & B & M & B & M \\
B & M & P & M & B \\
\end{array}
\]

In this arrangement:
- Each \(5 \times 5\) subgrid contains exactly one ""B"", one ""M"", and one ""P"".
- Each row and each column contains exactly one ""B"" and one ""M"".
- Each ""pārkāptu"" character is placed such that it does not create a \(5 \times 5\) subgrid that is missing either a ""B"" or an ""M"".

Therefore, the number of ways to place the ""pārkāptu"" characters is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",902,"[902, '902']",False
