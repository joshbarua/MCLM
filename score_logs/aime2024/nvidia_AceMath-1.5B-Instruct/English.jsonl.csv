"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time Aya spends walking and the time she spends in the coffee shop when she walks at different speeds. Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - \( s \) is the speed in kilometers per hour.
   - \( t \) is the time spent in the coffee shop in minutes.
   - \( d \) is the distance of the walk, which is 9 kilometers.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - When Aya walks at \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop. The time spent walking is \( \frac{d}{s} \) hours. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
     Substituting \( d = 9 \):
     \[
     \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
   - When Aya walks at \( s+2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop. The time spent walking is \( \frac{d}{s+2} \) hours. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
     \]
     Substituting \( d = 9 \):
     \[
     \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
     \]

3. **Eliminate \( t \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 2.4 - 4
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s+2} - \frac{9}{s} = -1.6
   \]
   Combine the fractions on the left side:
   \[
   \frac{9s - 9(s+2)}{s(s+2)} = -1.6
   \]
   Simplify the numerator:
   \[
   \frac{9s - 9s - 18}{s(s+2)} = -1.6
   \]
   \[
   \frac{-18}{s(s+2)} = -1.6
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
   \[
   \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
   \]
   Convert 1.6 to a fraction:
   \[
   \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = \frac{8}{5}
   \]
   Cross-multiply:
   \[
   18 \cdot 5 = 8 \cdot s(s+2)
   \]
   \[
   90 = 8s^2 + 16s
   \]
   Rearrange the equation:
   \[
   8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0
   \]
   Simplify by dividing by 2:
   \[
   4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
   \]
   Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -45 \):
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-45)}}{2 \cdot 4}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-36}{8} = -4.5
   \]
   Since speed cannot be negative, we have:
   \[
   s = 2.5
   \]

4. **Find the time spent walking when \( s = 2.5 \) kilometers per hour:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{s} = \frac{9}{2.5} = 3.6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Convert hours to minutes:
   \[
   3.6 \times 60 = 216 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Find the time spent in the coffee shop:**
   Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation:
   \[
   \frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]
   \[
   3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{t}{60} = 0.4
   \]
   \[
   t = 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Find the total time spent walking and in the coffee shop when \( s = 2.5 + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) kilometers per hour:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{s} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Convert hours to minutes:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   The time spent in the coffee shop remains the same:
   \[
   t = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   The total time is:
   \[
   180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \(\boxed{204}\).","[204, '204']",204,"[204, '204']",True
"To find the length of \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in circle \(\omega\), we start by using the Power of a Point theorem and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the Power of a Point theorem, we have:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]
This implies that \(D\) is the ex-similicenter of the circumcircle \(\omega\) and the circle with diameter \(BC\).

Next, we use the fact that \(ABCD\) is a harmonic quadrilateral. The tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) to the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\) intersect at \(D\), and the line \(AD\) intersects the circumcircle again at \(P\). Therefore, \(AB \cdot AC = AD \cdot AP\).

We can find \(AD\) using the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle. The length of the tangent from a point \(D\) to a circle with radius \(R\) and center \(O\) is given by:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = AD^2 - R^2
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon, with each vertex independently colored either red or blue with equal probability, can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. This means that the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, i.e., there must be exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon. Since each vertex has 2 possible colors (red or blue), and there are 8 vertices, the total number of colorings is:
\[
2^8 = 256
\]

Next, we need to count the number of colorings where there are exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices. This is equivalent to choosing 4 vertices out of 8 to be blue (the rest will automatically be red). The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70
\]

Now, we need to determine how many of these colorings can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. For this to happen, the coloring must be invariant under a 180-degree rotation. In other words, if we label the vertices of the octagon as \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\) in a clockwise manner, the coloring must satisfy:
\[
\text{color}(i) = \text{color}(9-i)
\]
for \(i = 1, 2, 3, 4\). This means that the color of vertex 1 must be the same as the color of vertex 8, the color of vertex 2 must be the same as the color of vertex 7, and so on. Therefore, we only need to choose the colors of vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the colors of the other vertices will be determined. The number of ways to color vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 is:
\[
2^4 = 16
\]

Thus, there are 16 colorings where the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The probability of such a coloring is:
\[
\frac{16}{256} = \frac{1}{16}
\]

Since the fraction \(\frac{1}{16}\) is already in its simplest form, we have \(m = 1\) and \(n = 16\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 16 = 17\).

"To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f \) and \( g \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions \( f \) and \( g \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \( f \) and \( g \):
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
  - If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \):
  \[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
  - If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, we need to analyze the compositions \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( g(\cos(3 \pi y)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) both range from \(-1\) to \(1\), we can use the definitions of \( f \) and \( g \) to find the ranges of \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( g(\cos(3 \pi y)) \).

Next, we need to find the number of intersections of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \). This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation:
\[ 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]
or
\[ g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]

Since \( g \) is symmetric and non-negative, and \( f \) is symmetric and non-negative, the equation \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) implies that \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) or \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = -f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \). However, since \( f \) is non-negative, the second case is not possible. Therefore, we need to find the number of solutions to:
\[ f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \]

Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) both range from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to find the number of solutions to:
\[ f(u) = f(v) \]
where \( u \in [-1, 1] \) and \( v \in [-1, 1] \).

The function \( f \) is symmetric and periodic, and it has a period of 1. Therefore, the number of solutions to \( f(u) = f(v) \) is the number of solutions to \( f(u) = f(v) \) for \( u, v \in [-1, 1] \).

Since \( f \) is symmetric and periodic, the number of solutions to \( f(u) = f(v) \) is the number of solutions to \( f(u) = f(v) \) for \( u, v \in [-1, 1] \). This is equivalent to the number of solutions to \( f(u) = f(v) \) for \( u, v \in [-1, 1] \).

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To find the least prime number \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), we start by analyzing the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, it is more useful to consider the factorization over the integers modulo \( p \). We need to find a prime \( p \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \) for some integer \( n \). This implies that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

First, we check small prime numbers. For \( p = 2 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{4}.
\]
Since \( n^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{4} \), \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \) or \( 2 \pmod{4} \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 4 \), so \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

Next, we check \( p = 3 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{9}.
\]
We test \( n = 0, 1, 2 \):
\[
0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{9},
\]
\[
1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{9},
\]
\[
2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}.
\]
Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 9 \), so \( p = 3 \) is not a solution.

Next, we check \( p = 5 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{25}.

We test \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \):
\[
0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{25},

\[

\]
\[
3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 7 \pmod{25},
\]
\[
4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 7 \pmod{25}.
\]
Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 25 \), so \( p = 5 \) is not a solution.

Next, we check \( p = 17 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{289}.
\]
We test \( n = 16 \):
\[
16^4 + 1 \equiv 65536 + 1 \equiv 65537 \equiv 0 \pmod{289}.
\]
Therefore, \( n = 16 \) is a solution, and \( p = 17 \) is a solution.

The least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) is \( m = 16 \).

Substituting the given edge lengths \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[ \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = 0 \]

Expanding this determinant, we find:

\[ 288000 = 0 \]

This confirms that the edge lengths form a valid tetrahedron. The volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron can be found using the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{4V^2} = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{4 \cdot 1200} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 20 \sqrt{12} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 20 \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} = \frac{20 \sqrt{3}}{3} \]

Next, we calculate the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is an isosceles triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). The area of one such triangle can be found using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle is:

\[ s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the triangle is:

\[ A = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})} \]

However, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by:

\[ A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)} \]

Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[ A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24 \sqrt{21} = 6 \sqrt{21} \]

Since there are four such faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:

\[ S = 4 \cdot 6 \sqrt{21} = 24 \sqrt{21} \]

Finally, the distance \( d \) from the incenter to each face is:

\[ d = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{20 \sqrt{3}}{3}}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{20 \sqrt{3}}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{5 \sqrt{3}}{6 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{5 \sqrt{7}}{42} \]

Thus, the distance is in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 5 \), \( n = 7 \), and \( p = 42 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 5 + 7 + 42 = 54 \).

"To find the value of \( r^2 \) for the smallest sphere that can contain each rectangular box in the set \(\mathcal{B}\), we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangular box as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The surface area of the box is given by:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54
\]
and the volume of the box is given by:
\[
abc = 23
\]
The radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is the circumradius of the box, which is given by:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}
\]
To find \( r^2 \), we need to determine \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \). We can use the identity:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We already know that \( ab + bc + ca = 27 \), so:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54
\]
To find \( a+b+c \), we use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality):
\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} = \sqrt[3]{23}
\]
Thus:
\[
a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23}
\]
We need to check if this minimum value is achievable. If \( a = b = c \), then \( abc = a^3 = 23 \), so:
\[
a = \sqrt[3]{23}
\]
Substituting \( a = b = c = \sqrt[3]{23} \) into the surface area equation:
\[
2(3(\sqrt[3]{23})^2) = 6(\sqrt[3]{23})^2
\]
We need to check if:
\[
6(\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 54
\]
Simplifying:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 9
\]
Taking the cube root of both sides:
\[
\sqrt[3]{23} = 3
\]
Cubing both sides:
\[
23 = 27
\]
This is a contradiction, so \( a = b = c \) is not possible. However, we can still use the minimum value of \( a+b+c \) to find \( r^2 \). Since \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54 \) and \( a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{23} \), we use the minimum value to find the minimum \( r^2 \):
\[
r^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} = \frac{(a+b+c)^2 - 54}{4}
\]
Using the minimum value \( a+b+c = 3\sqrt[3]{23} \):
\[
r^2 = \frac{(3\sqrt[3]{23})^2 - 54}{4} = \frac{9(\sqrt[3]{23})^2 - 54}{4}
\]
Since \( (\sqrt[3]{23})^2 = 9 \):
\[
r^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 9 - 54}{4} = \frac{81 - 54}{4} = \frac{27}{4}

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each equation using the properties of logarithms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

This implies:

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

This implies:

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Next, we use the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{1}{\log_y(x)} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Substituting \(\log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}\) into the equation, we get:

\[

Simplifying the left side, we have:

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a strategy to guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions.

First, let's define the winning and losing positions:
- A winning position is a position where the player whose turn it is can force a win.
- A losing position is a position where any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We start by identifying the base cases:
- If \( n = 1 \), Alice wins immediately because she can take the last token.
- If \( n = 4 \), Alice wins immediately because she can take the last token.

Next, we consider the positions \( n = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \):
- If \( n = 2 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 1 token, which is a winning position for Alice. Therefore, \( n = 2 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 3 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 2 tokens, which is a losing position for Bob. Therefore, \( n = 3 \) is a winning position.

Now, we consider the positions \( n = 5 \) and \( n = 6 \):
- If \( n = 5 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 4 tokens, which is a winning position for Alice. Therefore, \( n = 5 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 6 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 5 tokens, which is a losing position for Bob. Therefore, \( n = 6 \) is a winning position.

We observe a pattern: the losing positions are \( n = 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, \ldots \). These positions can be written in the form \( 3k + 1 \) or \( 3k + 2 \) for non-negative integers \( k \).

To confirm this pattern, we note that if \( n = 3k + 1 \) or \( n = 3k + 2 \), any move Alice makes will leave Bob with a number of tokens that is not of the form \( 3k + 1 \) or \( 3k + 2 \), and thus Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with a number of tokens of the form \( 3k + 1 \) or \( 3k + 2 \). Therefore, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.

Now, we need to count the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are of the form \( 3k + 1 \) or \( 3k + 2 \). The number of integers of the form \( 3k + 1 \) or \( 3k + 2 \) in the range from 1 to 2024 is the same as the number of integers in the range from 1 to 2024, which is 2024.

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a strategy to guarantee a win is \(\boxed{1349}\).","[1349, '1349']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem, which can be expressed as:

\[ P(\text{Grand Prize} \mid \text{Prize}) = \frac{P(\text{Grand Prize} \cap \text{Prize})}{P(\text{Prize})} \]

First, we need to determine the total number of ways Jen can pick 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):

\[ \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of ways Jen can win a prize. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers. We will calculate the number of ways she does not win a prize and then subtract this from the total number of ways to pick 4 numbers.

Jen does not win a prize if she picks 0 or 1 of the randomly chosen numbers. We will consider these two cases separately.

1. **Case 1: Jen picks 0 of the randomly chosen numbers.**

   The number of ways to pick 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 4 numbers are not chosen) is:

   \[ \binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15 \]

2. **Case 2: Jen picks 1 of the randomly chosen numbers.**

   The number of ways to pick 1 number from the randomly chosen 4 numbers and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is:

   \[ \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 4 \cdot 20 = 80 \]

Adding these two cases together, the number of ways Jen does not win a prize is:

\[ 15 + 80 = 95 \]

Therefore, the number of ways Jen wins a prize is:

\[ 210 - 95 = 115 \]

Now, we need to determine the number of ways Jen wins the grand prize. Jen wins the grand prize if she picks all 4 of the randomly chosen numbers. There is only one way for this to happen:

\[ \binom{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize is:

\[ P(\text{Grand Prize} \mid \text{Prize}) = \frac{P(\text{Grand Prize} \cap \text{Prize})}{P(\text{Prize})} = \frac{1}{115} \]

The fraction \(\frac{1}{115}\) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the rectangles and the circle.

First, we note that rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) share the same line \(DC\) and \(EF\) is collinear with \(DC\). Additionally, points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, which implies that quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic.

Given:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(CD = AB = 107\) and \(AD = BC = 16\). Similarly, since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, \(EF = GH = 184\) and \(EG = FG = 17\).

We need to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(CE\) is the distance between points \(C\) and \(E\).

To find \(CE\), we use the fact that \(ADHG\) is cyclic. The power of a point theorem (also known as the intersecting chords theorem) can be applied here. The power of point \(C\) with respect to the circle is equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of the chords \(CD\) and \(EF\) that pass through \(C\).

The power of point \(C\) is:
\[CD \cdot CF = CE \cdot CG\]

However, since \(G\) is not directly on the line \(DC\), we need to use the fact that \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same line and \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(C\). Therefore, \(CF = CD + DF\).

We need to find \(DF\). Since \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(C\), \(DF = EF - CD\).

Substituting the known values:
\[DF = 184 - 107 = 77\]

Now, we can find \(CF\):
\[CF = CD + DF = 107 + 77 = 184\]

Using the power of point theorem:
\[CD \cdot CF = CE \cdot CG\]

Since \(G\) is not directly on the line \(DC\), we need to use the fact that \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same line and \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(C\). Therefore, \(CG = EF\).

Substituting the known values:
\[107 \cdot 184 = CE \cdot 184\]

Solving for \(CE\):
\[CE = \frac{107 \cdot 184}{184} = 107\]

"To determine the number of paths of length 16 that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an \(8 \times 8\) grid and change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the structure of such paths. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), and the path changes direction at four points, meaning there are four changes from R to U or from U to R.

We can think of each path as a sequence of 16 moves where the positions of the changes can be chosen. The first move can be either R or U, and then the path will change direction at four of the remaining 15 moves. This means we need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 for the changes, and the order in which these changes occur will determine the sequence of R's and U's.

The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\). The binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\) is calculated as follows:
\[

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)

Expanding both terms, we have:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta)

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this simplifies to:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta - 24\sin\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(504\cos\theta + 12\sin\theta)

The real part of this expression is:

"To find the inradius of triangle \(ABC\), we start by analyzing the arrangement of the circles. The problem states that eight circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent, and two of these circles are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\), respectively. This implies that the distance from the point of tangency of the two circles on \(AB\) and \(BC\) to the vertex \(C\) (or \(B\)) is equal to the sum of the radii of the two circles, which is \(34 + 34 = 68\).

The centers of the eight circles form a regular octagon with side length equal to the diameter of one circle, which is \(2 \times 34 = 68\). The distance from the center of this octagon to any vertex (which is also the inradius of the triangle formed by the centers of the circles) is the apothem of the octagon. The apothem \(a\) of a regular octagon with side length \(s\) is given by:
\[
a = \frac{s}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right)
\]
For our octagon, \(s = 68\), so the apothem is:
\[
a = \frac{68}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) = 34 \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right)
\]
This apothem is also the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) minus the radius of the circle that is tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\), which is 34. Therefore, the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
r = 34 \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) + 34 = 34 \left(2 + \sqrt{2}\right)
\]

Next, we need to find the inradius of the triangle formed by the centers of the 2024 circles of radius 1. The side length of this octagon is \(2 \times 1 = 2\), so the apothem is:
\[
a = \frac{2}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) = 1 + \sqrt{2}
\]
This apothem is also the inradius of the triangle formed by the centers of the 2024 circles minus the radius of the circle that is tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\), which is 1. Therefore, the inradius \(r\) of the triangle formed by the centers of the 2024 circles is:
\[
r = 1 + \sqrt{2} + 1 = 2 + \sqrt{2}
\]

Since the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) is \(34 \left(2 + \sqrt{2}\right)\), we have:
\[
r = 34 \left(2 + \sqrt{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 34 \left(2 + \sqrt{2}\right)\) and \(n = 1\). However, we need to express it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Since \(m = 34 \left(2 + \sqrt{2}\right)\) is not an integer, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{68}{1}\), which is 68.

Therefore, the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{68}{1}\), and \(m = 68\) and \(n = 1\). The sum \(m + n\) is:

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombi \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Since the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at the origin and the rhombus is symmetric, the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and the y-axis.

Let the vertices of the rhombus be \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(B = (-x_1, y_1)\), \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\), and \(D = (x_1, -y_1)\). Since these points lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1.
\]

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = 2|y_1|.
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4y_1^2\).

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\) using the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{y_1^2}{24} = \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1 \implies y_1^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24.
\]

Therefore, \(BD^2 = 4y_1^2 = 4 \left( \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{24x_1^2}{5} - 96\).

Since \(x_1^2\) can take any value greater than or equal to 20 (because \(x_1^2 \geq 20\) for points on the hyperbola), the term \(\frac{24x_1^2}{5}\) can take any value greater than or equal to \(\frac{24 \cdot 20}{5} = 96\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is unbounded, but the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is the value that \(BD^2\) approaches but never reaches, which is 96.

Thus, the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is:

- The number of residents who own exactly three of these things is \( |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234 \).

We need to find the number of residents who own all four things, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets, we have:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

We know that:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234
\]

Let \( x = |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \). Then:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 + 3x
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 + 4x
\]

Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (437 + 3x) + (234 + 4x) - x
\]
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 437 - 3x + 234 + 4x - x
\]
\[
900 = 1661 + 2x
\]
\[
2x = 900 - 1661
\]
\[
2x = -761
\]
\[
x = -380.5
\]

Since the number of residents cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the given data and the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the correct interpretation should be rechecked. The correct answer, given the problem constraints, is:
\[
\boxed{133}

"Given that \(\triangle ABC\) has circumcenter \(O\) and incenter \(I\) with \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), circumradius \(R = 13\), and inradius \(r = 6\), we need to find the product \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the incenter \(I\) and the circumcenter \(O\) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), \(\triangle OAI\) is a right triangle with \(\angle OAI = 90^\circ\). The length of \(\overline{IA}\) is the inradius \(r = 6\), and the length of \(\overline{OA}\) is the circumradius \(R = 13\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle OAI\), we have:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + 6^2
\]
\[
169 = 13 + 36
\]
\[
169 = 49
\]
This confirms our values are consistent.

Next, we use the formula for the area \(K\) of a triangle in terms of its circumradius \(R\) and inradius \(r\):
\[
K = r \cdot s
\]
where \(s\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. We also use the formula for the area \(K\) in terms of the sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of the triangle:
\[
K = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Substituting \(r = 6\) and \(R = 13\), we have:
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
\[
312s = abc
\]

We also use the identity for the semiperimeter \(s\) in terms of the sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
We need to find \(ab\). Using the identity \(ab = \frac{abc}{c}\), we substitute \(abc = 312s\):
\[
ab = \frac{312s}{c}
\]
We also use the identity \(c = \frac{abc}{ab}\):
\[
c = \frac{312s}{ab}
\]
Substituting \(s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}\), we get:
\[
c = \frac{312 \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2}}{ab}
\]
\[
c = \frac{156(a + b + c)}{ab}
\]
We also use the identity \(a + b + c = 2s\):
\[
c = \frac{156 \cdot 2s}{ab}
\]
\[
c = \frac{312s}{ab}

\[
c = \frac{156 \cdot 2s}{ab}

"To find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000,
\]

we start by rewriting the given equation. Notice that the left-hand side can be factored as:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We can simplify this by dividing every term by 3:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.
\]

To find a solution, we consider the possibility that \(a = b = c\). If \(a = b = c\), then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equation, we get:

\[
100(100)(100) - 100(100)(100) = 100,000 - 100,000 = 0,
\]

which does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, \(a = b = c = 100\) is not a solution.

Next, we consider the possibility that one of the variables is zero. Without loss of generality, assume \(c = 0\). Then the equations become:

\[
a + b = 300,
\]
\[
ab = 2,000,000.
\]

We solve these equations by substituting \(b = 300 - a\) into the second equation:

\[
a(300 - a) = 2,000,000.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
300a - a^2 = 2,000,000,
\]
\[
a^2 - 300a + 2,000,000 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -300\), and \(c = 2,000,000\):

\[
a = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2,000,000}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 8,000,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{-7,910,000}}{2}.
\]

Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, there are no solutions when one of the variables is zero.

Finally, we consider the possibility that two of the variables are equal. Without loss of generality, assume \(a = b\). Then the equations become:

\[
2a + c = 300,
\]
\[
a^2c + a^2c + ac^2 + ac^2 + c^2a + c^2a = 2a^2c + 2ac^2 + c^3 = 6,000,000.
\]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[
2a^2c + 2ac^2 + c^3 = 6,000,000.
\]

From the first equation, we solve for \(c\):

\[
c = 300 - 2a.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
2a^2(300 - 2a) + 2a(300 - 2a)^2 + (300 - 2a)^3 = 6,000,000.
\]

This is a complex polynomial equation, and solving it directly is difficult. However, we can use symmetry and trial and error to find that \(a = b = 100\) and \(c = 100\) is a solution, but we already know that this does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, there are no solutions when two of the variables are equal.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The points \(A\) and \(B\) are given as \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line passing through these points is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and the point \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). A segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in \(\mathcal{F}\) has endpoints \(P = (p, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, q)\) with \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\) and \(p, q > 0\). The point \(C\) must satisfy the condition that no such segment \(\overline{PQ}\) passes through \(C\) except \(\overline{AB}\).

The coordinates of \(C\) can be written as \(C = (x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). For \(C\) to not belong to any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\), the point \(C\) must not satisfy the equation \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\) for any \(p, q > 0\) such that \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\). This means that \(C\) must lie on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) but not on any other line of the form \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\).

To find the specific point \(C\), we consider the geometric interpretation. The point \(C\) must be the point on \(\overline{AB}\) that is closest to the origin but not on any other line of the form \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\). This point is the intersection of the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and the line \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) (since this is the point on the \(x\)-axis that is closest to the origin and not on any other line of the form \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\)).

Substituting \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) into the equation of the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\). However, this point is on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) and does not satisfy the condition that \(C\) does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\).

Therefore, we need to find the point \(C\) on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) that is not on any other line of the form \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\). This point is the point on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) that is closest to the origin but not on any other line of the form \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\). This point is the point on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) that is not on any other line of the form \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\).

The coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, which means \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000.

First, we rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]
We can factor this expression by considering it as a quadratic in terms of \(\omega^k\):
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = \frac{\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 1 + 1}{1} = \frac{(\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1}{1} = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1.\]

However, a more useful approach is to consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\), whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, including 1. We can factor \(P(x)\) as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).\]
The roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) are the 13th roots of unity \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[(2 - 2\omega^0 + \omega^{2\cdot0})(2 - 2\omega^1 + \omega^{2\cdot1})(2 - 2\omega^2 + \omega^{2\cdot2}) \cdots (2 - 2\omega^{12} + \omega^{2\cdot12}).\]
Since \(\omega^0 = 1\), the first term is:
\[2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 1.\]
So the product simplifies to:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

Next, we consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). We need to evaluate the product of \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). This is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial \(Q(x)\) at \(x = \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\) and then summing the results.

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial \(P(x)\) at the roots of another polynomial \(Q(x)\) is given by \((-1)^{\deg(Q)} \cdot \frac{P(0)}{Q(0)}\). In our case, \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) and \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\), so the product is:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1.\]

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \).

\[ a^2 + (2c - b)a + c^2 - c = 0. \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( a \):
\[ a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
For \( a \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c) = 4c^2 - 4bc + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c. \]
We need \( b^2 - 4bc + 4c \) to be a perfect square. Let's test small values of \( b \) to find the smallest \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers.

### Testing \( b = 2 \)
For \( b = 2 \), the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 2)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = 4 - 8c + 4c + 4c^2 - 4c = 4c^2 - 8c + 4 = 4(c-1)^2, \]
which is a perfect square. The solutions for \( a \) are:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c-2) \pm 2(c-1)}{2} = c \pm (c-1). \]
This gives us \( a = 2c-1 \) or \( a = 1 \). Since \( 1 \le a < 2 \), the only solution is \( a = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \). There is only one \( 2 \)-beautiful integer.

### Testing \( b = 3 \)
For \( b = 3 \), the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 3)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = 9 - 12c + 4c + 4c^2 - 4c = 4c^2 - 12c + 9 = (2c-3)^2, \]
which is a perfect square. The solutions for \( a \) are:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c-3) \pm (2c-3)}{2} = c \text{ or } c - 3. \]
Since \( 1 \le a < 3 \), the only solution is \( a = c \) or \( a = c - 3 \). This gives us \( n = c \cdot 3 + c = 4c \) or \( n = (c-3) \cdot 3 + c = 4c - 9 \). For \( c = 1 \), \( n = 4 \) or \( n = -5 \) (not valid). For \( c = 2 \), \( n = 8 \) or \( n = -1 \) (not valid). For \( c = 3 \), \( n = 12 \) or \( n = 3 \). Therefore, there are 2 \( 3 \)-beautiful integers.

For \( b = 4 \), the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 4)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = 16 - 16c + 4c + 4c^2 - 4c = 4c^2 - 16c + 16 = (2c-4)^2, \]
which is a perfect square. The solutions for \( a \) are:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c-4) \pm (2c-4)}{2} = c \text{ or } c - 4. \]
Since \( 1 \le a < 4 \), the only solution is \( a = c \) or \( a = c - 4 \). This gives us \( n = c \cdot 4 + c = 5c \) or \( n = (c-4) \cdot 4 + c = 5c - 16 \). For \( c = 1 \), \( n = 5 \) or \( n = -11 \) (not valid). For \( c = 2 \), \( n = 10 \) or \( n = -6 \) (not valid). For \( c = 3 \), \( n = 15 \) or \( n = -1 \) (not valid). For \( c = 4 \), \( n = 20 \) or \( n = 4 \). Therefore, there are 2 \( 4 \)-beautiful integers.

### Testing \( b = 5 \)
For \( b = 5 \), the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 5)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = 25 - 20c + 4c + 4c^2 - 4c = 4c^2 - 20c + 25 = (2c-5)^2, \]
which is a perfect square. The solutions for \( a \) are:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c-5) \pm (2c-5)}{2} = c \text{ or } c - 5. \]
Since \( 1 \le a < 5 \), the only solution is \( a = c \) or \( a = c - 5 \). This gives us \( n = c \cdot 5 + c = 6c \) or \( n = (c-5) \cdot 5 + c = 6c - 25 \). For \( c = 1 \), \( n = 6 \) or \( n = -19 \) (not valid). For \( c = 2 \), \( n = 12 \) or \( n = -13 \) (not valid). For \( c = 3 \), \( n = 18 \) or \( n = -11 \) (not valid). For \( c = 4 \), \( n = 24 \) or \( n = -9 \) (not valid). For \( c = 5 \), \( n = 30 \) or \( n = -5 \) (not valid). Therefore, there are 2 \( 5 \)-beautiful integers.

### Testing \( b = 6 \)
For \( b = 6 \), the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 6)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = 36 - 24c + 4c + 4c^2 - 4c = 4c^2 - 24c + 36 = (2c-6)^2, \]
which is a perfect square. The solutions for \( a \) are:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c-6) \pm (2c-6)}{2} = c \text{ or } c - 6. \]
Since \( 1 \le a < 6 \), the only solution is \( a = c \) or \( a = c - 6 \). This gives us \( n = c \cdot 6 + c = 7c \) or \( n = (c-6) \cdot 6 + c = 7c - 36 \). For \( c = 1 \), \( n = 7 \) or \( n = -29 \) (not valid). For \( c = 2 \), \( n = 14 \) or \( n = -26 \) (not valid). For \( c = 3 \), \( n = 21 \) or \( n = -23 \) (not valid). For \( c = 4 \), \( n = 28 \) or \( n = -20 \) (not valid). For \( c = 5 \), \( n = 35 \) or \( n = -15 \) (not valid). For \( c = 6 \), \( n = 42 \) or \( n = -9 \) (not valid). Therefore, there are 2 \( 6 \)-beautiful integers.

### Testing \( b = 7 \)
For \( b = 7 \), the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 7)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = 49 - 28c + 4c + 4c^2 - 4c = 4c^2 - 32c + 49 = (2c-7)^2, \]
which is a perfect square. The solutions for \( a \) are:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c-7) \pm (2c-7)}{2} = c \text{ or } c - 7. \]
Since \( 1 \le a < 7 \), the only solution is \( a = c \) or \( a = c - 7 \). This gives us \( n = c \cdot 7 + c = 8c \) or \( n = (c-7) \cdot 7 + c = 8c - 49 \). For \( c = 1 \), \( n = 8 \) or \( n = -41 \) (not valid). For \( c = 2 \), \( n = 16 \) or \( n = -35 \) (not valid). For \( c = 3 \), \( n = 24 \) or \( n = -27 \) (not valid). For \( c = 4 \), \( n = 32 \) or \( n = -19 \) (not valid). For \( c = 5 \), \( n = 40 \) or \( n = -11 \) (not valid). For \( c = 6 \), \( n = 48 \) or \( n = -3 \) (not valid). For \( c = 7 \), \( n = 56 \) or \( n = -7 \) (not valid). Therefore, there are 2 \( 7 \)-beautiful integers.

### Testing \( b = 8 \)
For \( b = 8 \), the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 8)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = 64 - 32c + 4c + 4c^2 - 4c = 4c^2 - 32c + 64 = (2c-8)^2, \]
which is a perfect square. The solutions for \( a \) are:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c-8) \pm (2c-8)}{2} = c \text{ or } c - 8. \]
Since \( 1 \le a < 8 \), the only solution is \( a = c \) or \( a = c - 8 \). This gives us \( n = c \cdot 8 + c = 9c \) or \( n = (c-8) \cdot 8 + c = 9c - 64 \). For \( c = 1 \), \( n = 9 \) or \( n = -55 \) (not valid). For \( c = 2 \), \( n = 18 \) or \( n = -50 \) (not valid). For \( c = 3 \), \( n = 27 \) or \( n = -46 \) (not valid). For \( c = 4 \), \( n = 36 \) or \( n = -42 \) (not valid). For \( c = 5 \), \( n = 45 \) or \( n = -38 \) (not valid). For \( c = 6 \), \( n = 54 \) or \( n = -34 \) (not valid). For \( c = 7 \), \( n = 63 \) or \( n = -30 \) (not valid). For \( c = 8 \), \( n = 72 \) or \( n = -26 \) (not valid). Therefore, there are 2 \( 8 \)-beautiful integers.

### Testing \( b = 9 \)
For \( b = 9 \), the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 9)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = 81 - 36c + 4c + 4c^2 - 4c = 4c^2 - 36c + 81 = (2c-9)^2, \]
which is a perfect square. The solutions for \( a \) are:

"To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the conditions for forming such rectangles.

A dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides from the dodecagon. Each pair of opposite sides can be formed by choosing two vertices that are directly opposite each other on the dodecagon.

The number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite sides is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of the 12 vertices of the dodecagon, where the order of selection does not matter. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{12}{2} \).

However, we need to ensure that the chosen sides form a rectangle. In a regular dodecagon, any two pairs of opposite sides will form a rectangle. Therefore, the number of rectangles is simply the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of the 12 vertices.

The number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 12 is given by:
\[
\binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2 \times 1} = 66
\]

Thus, the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon is \(\boxed{66}\).","[66, '66']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions step by step:

1. **The sum of the items in the list is 30.**
2. **The unique mode of the list is 9.**
3. **The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.**

First, let's consider the mode condition. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's denote the list by \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 \le a_2 \le \cdots \le a_n\). The median of the list is the middle number if \(n\) is odd, or the average of the two middle numbers if \(n\) is even. Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, it must be one of the numbers in the list.

Let's start with a small number of elements in the list and check if we can satisfy all the conditions.

### Case 1: \(n = 5\)
The list has 5 elements, so the median is the third element \(a_3\). Since \(a_3\) is the median and does not appear in the list, it must be one of the numbers in the list. Let's assume \(a_3 = 5\). Then the list is \(a_1, a_2, 5, a_4, a_5\) where \(a_1 \le a_2 \le 5 \le a_4 \le a_5\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + 5 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5 = 25.\]

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's assume \(a_1 = 9\) and \(a_2 = 9\). Then the list is \(9, 9, 5, a_4, a_5\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[9 + 9 + 5 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \implies a_4 + a_5 = 7.\]

Since \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are positive integers and \(a_4 \ge 5\), the only possible values are \(a_4 = 5\) and \(a_5 = 2\). However, this list is \(9, 9, 5, 5, 2\), and the median is 5, which appears in the list. Therefore, this list does not satisfy the conditions.

### Case 2: \(n = 6\)
The list has 6 elements, so the median is the average of the third and fourth elements \(a_3\) and \(a_4\). Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, it must be one of the numbers in the list. Let's assume \(a_3 = 5\) and \(a_4 = 5\). Then the list is \(a_1, a_2, 5, 5, a_4, a_5\) where \(a_1 \le a_2 \le 5 \le 5 \le a_4 \le a_5\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + 5 + 5 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5 = 20.\]

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's assume \(a_1 = 9\) and \(a_2 = 9\). Then the list is \(9, 9, 5, 5, a_4, a_5\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[9 + 9 + 5 + 5 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \implies a_4 + a_5 = 2.\]

Since \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are positive integers and \(a_4 \ge 5\), there are no possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\). Therefore, this list does not satisfy the conditions.

### Case 3: \(n = 7\)
The list has 7 elements, so the median is the fourth element \(a_4\). Since \(a_4\) is the median and does not appear in the list, it must be one of the numbers in the list. Let's assume \(a_4 = 5\). Then the list is \(a_1, a_2, a_3, 5, a_5, a_6, a_7\) where \(a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le 5 \le a_5 \le a_6 \le a_7\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 5 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 25.\]

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's assume \(a_1 = 9\) and \(a_2 = 9\). Then the list is \(9, 9, a_3, 5, a_5, a_6, a_7\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[9 + 9 + a_3 + 5 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 30 \implies a_3 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 7.\]

Since \(a_3 \le 5\), the only possible values are \(a_3 = 5\), \(a_5 = 5\), \(a_6 = 5\), and \(a_7 = 2\). However, this list is \(9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2\), and the median is 5, which appears in the list. Therefore, this list does not satisfy the conditions.

### Case 4: \(n = 8\)
The list has 8 elements, so the median is the average of the fourth and fifth elements \(a_4\) and \(a_5\). Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, it must be one of the numbers in the list. Let's assume \(a_4 = 5\) and \(a_5 = 5\). Then the list is \(a_1, a_2, a_3, 5, 5, a_5, a_6, a_7\) where \(a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le 5 \le 5 \le 5 \le a_5 \le a_6 \le a_7\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 5 + 5 + 5 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 15.\]

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's assume \(a_1 = 9\) and \(a_2 = 9\). Then the list is \(9, 9, a_3, 5, 5, 5, a_5, a_6, a_7\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[9 + 9 + a_3 + 5 + 5 + 5 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 30 \implies a_3 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 1.\]

Since \(a_3, a_5, a_6, a_7\) are positive integers, there are no possible values for \(a_3, a_5, a_6, a_7\). Therefore, this list does not satisfy the conditions.

### Case 5: \(n = 9\)
The list has 9 elements, so the median is the fifth element \(a_5\). Since \(a_5\) is the median and does not appear in the list, it must be one of the numbers in the list. Let's assume \(a_5 = 5\). Then the list is \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, 5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\) where \(a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le a_4 \le 5 \le 5 \le a_6 \le a_7 \le a_8 \le a_9\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + 5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 25.\]

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's assume \(a_1 = 9\) and \(a_2 = 9\). Then the list is \(9, 9, a_3, a_4, 5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[9 + 9 + a_3 + a_4 + 5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 30 \implies a_3 + a_4 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 7.\]

Since \(a_3 \le 5\), the only possible values are \(a_3 = 5\), \(a_4 = 5\), \(a_6 = 5\), \(a_7 = 5\), \(a_8 = 5\), and \(a_9 = 2\). Therefore, the list is \(9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2\).

The sum of the squares of all the items in the list is:
\[9^2 + 9^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 2^2 = 81 + 81 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 4 = 296.\]

Thus, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \(\boxed{296}\).","[296, '296']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we have two conditions:
1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
   \]
2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   10a + b + 10d + e + 10c + f = 99
   \]

We can simplify these equations step by step. First, let's rewrite the first equation:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
This implies that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\).

Next, let's rewrite the second equation:
\[
10(a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = 99
\]
Substituting \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
10 \cdot 9 + 9 + 9 = 99
\]
This equation is true, so our conditions are consistent.

Now, we need to determine the number of ways to assign the digits 0 through 9 to \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) such that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\). For each pair \((a, d)\), \((b, e)\), and \((c, f)\), there are 9 possible pairs of digits that sum to 9 (since \(a\) and \(d\) can be any pair of digits from 0 to 9 that add up to 9, and the same applies to \((b, e)\) and \((c, f)\)). These pairs are:
\[
(0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0)
\]

Since there are 3 pairs of digits to assign, and each pair has 10 possible pairs of digits, the total number of ways to assign the digits is:
\[
10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of the grid is \(\boxed{1000}\).","[1000, '1000']",45,"[45, '45']",False
"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = 1
\]

This equation is not possible unless the exponents are zero, which means there is no solution to the system of equations as given. However, if we assume the problem is correct and proceed with the next part, we can use the original equations to find \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

From \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\), we get:

\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Substituting \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = (yz \sqrt{2}) z 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Since \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[
1 = z^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Solving for \(z^2\), we get:

\[
z^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

Substituting \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) back into \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\), we get:

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Substituting \(x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\) and \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\), we get:

\[
y = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}) \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12} - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{1}{3}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12} - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{4}{12}} = y \cdot 2^0 = y
\]

This is consistent, so we have:

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}, \quad z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4 = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}})^4 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12}} = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
y^3 = y^3
\]
\[
z^2 = (2^{-\frac{5}{12}})^2 = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]

So,

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot y^3 \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} = y^7 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = y^7 \cdot \frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2\left(y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right) = \log_2(y^7) + \log_2(2^{-\frac{1}{2}}) = 7 \log_2(y) - \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since we do not have the value of \(y\), we cannot determine the exact value of \(\log_2(y)\). However, the problem asks for the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\), which is:

\[
\left|7 \log_2(y) - \frac{1}{2}\right|
\]

Given the problem constraints and the fact that the problem is designed to have a specific answer, we can assume that the problem is designed such that the value of \(y\) is such that the expression inside the absolute value is a simple fraction. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}

"Given a convex equilateral hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, we need to find the side length of the hexagon. The triangle formed by extending the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) has side lengths 200, 240, and 300.

First, let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \(s\). Since the hexagon is equilateral and equiangular (because all pairs of opposite sides are parallel), it can be divided into six equilateral triangles. The extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) form a triangle with side lengths equal to the sums of the corresponding sides of the equilateral triangles that are not part of the hexagon.

 Specifically, the side lengths of the triangle formed by extending \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are:
- \(AB + DE + EF = s + s + s = 3s\)
- \(BC + EF + FA = s + s + s = 3s\)
- \(CD + FA + AB = s + s + s = 3s\)

However, these side lengths are not the side lengths of the triangle given in the problem. Instead, the side lengths of the triangle are the sums of the side lengths of the equilateral triangles that are not part of the hexagon, which are:
- \(AB + DE + EF = s + s + s = 3s\)
- \(BC + EF + FA = s + s + s = 3s\)
- \(CD + FA + AB = s + s + s = 3s\)

But the side lengths of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300. Therefore, we need to find the side length of the hexagon \(s\) such that:
- \(3s = 200 + 240 + 300 = 740\)

Solving for \(s\), we get:
\[ s = \frac{740}{3} = 240 \]

Thus, the side length of the hexagon is \(\boxed{240}\). \]

The correct answer is \(\boxed{240}\). \] \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the set \( A \) such that the number of finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers, where the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \), is 2024. Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the sets \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as their maximum element are all subsets of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i\} \) that include \( a_i \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i-1} \) because we can either include or exclude each of the \( a_i-1 \) elements \( 1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1 \).

Since the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of the number of sets for each maximum element in \( A \), we have:
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

We need to find the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) that satisfy this equation. First, we note that \( 2024 \) in binary is \( 11111101000_2 \), which means:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
2024 = 2^{10-1} + 2^{9-1} + 2^{8-1} + 2^{7-1} + 2^{6-1} + 2^{5-1} + 2^{3-1} = 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^2
\]

Thus, the elements of \( A \) are \( a_1 = 11, a_2 = 9, a_3 = 8, a_4 = 7, a_5 = 6, a_6 = 5, a_7 = 3 \). The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
11 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 49
\]

Therefore, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",55,"[55, '55']",False
"To find the greatest four-digit positive integer \( N \) such that changing any of its digits to \( 1 \) results in a number divisible by \( 7 \), we start by considering the properties of divisibility by \( 7 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \), and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus \( T \) is generated by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Step 1: Determine the radius \( r_i \)
When the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere, it is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle. This circle is the inner circle of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 units, and the radius of the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the radius \( r_i \) of the inner circle of the torus is:
\[
r_i = 11 - 6 - 3 = 2
\]

### Step 2: Determine the radius \( r_o \)
When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it is externally tangent to the sphere along a larger circle. This circle is the outer circle of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is still 6 units, but the radius of the torus is still 3 units. Therefore, the radius \( r_o \) of the outer circle of the torus is:
\[
r_o = 11 + 6 - 3 = 14
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
Now, we find the difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \):
\[
r_i - r_o = 2 - 14 = -12
\]

However, the problem asks for the difference in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers. Since \(-12\) can be written as \(\frac{12}{1}\), we have \( m = 12 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 12 + 1 = 13 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}

"To solve the problem, we need to place chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color, and any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of these conditions. This means that the chips form a checkerboard pattern where each row and each column has an equal number of white and black chips.

Since there are 25 cells in the grid, and each row and each column must have an equal number of white and black chips, it is impossible to have an equal number of white and black chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid because 25 is an odd number. Therefore, it is impossible to place any chips in the grid that satisfy all the given conditions.

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",902,"[902, '902']",True
