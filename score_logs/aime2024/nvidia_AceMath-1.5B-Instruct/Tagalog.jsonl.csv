"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the lakad to reach Siya when she is naglalakad at different distances. Let's denote the time it takes for the lakad to reach Siya when she is naglalakad at \( s \) kilometers as \( T \) minutes.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. When Siya is naglalakad at \( s \) kilometers, the lakad takes \( T \) minutes to reach her, and it takes \( t \) minutes to reach the coffee shop.
2. When Siya is naglalakad at \( s + 2 \) kilometers, the lakad takes 2 oras (which is 120 minutes) to reach her, and it takes \( t \) minutes to reach the coffee shop.
3. When Siya is naglalakad at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers, the lakad takes \( T' \) minutes to reach her, and it takes \( t \) minutes to reach the coffee shop.

First, let's express the speed of the lakad. The speed of the lakad is the same in all scenarios, so we can use the relationship between distance, speed, and time. The speed of the lakad is given by:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

From the first scenario:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{s}{T} \]

From the second scenario:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{s + 2}{120} \]

Since the speed is the same, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[ \frac{s}{T} = \frac{s + 2}{120} \]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[ 120s = T(s + 2) \]
\[ 120s = Ts + 2T \]
\[ 120s - Ts = 2T \]
\[ s(120 - T) = 2T \]
\[ s = \frac{2T}{120 - T} \]

From the third scenario:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{s + \frac{1}{2}}{T'} \]

Since the speed is the same, we can set this expression equal to the speed from the first scenario:
\[ \frac{s}{T} = \frac{s + \frac{1}{2}}{T'} \]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[ sT' = T(s + \frac{1}{2}) \]
\[ sT' = Ts + \frac{T}{2} \]

Substituting \( s = \frac{2T}{120 - T} \) into the equation:
\[ \left( \frac{2T}{120 - T} \right) T' = T \left( \frac{2T}{120 - T} \right) + \frac{T}{2} \]
\[ \frac{2TT'}{120 - T} = \frac{2T^2}{120 - T} + \frac{T}{2} \]

To clear the denominators, multiply through by \( 2(120 - T) \):
\[ 4TT' = 4T^2 + T(120 - T) \]
\[ 4TT' = 4T^2 + 120T - T^2 \]
\[ 4TT' = 3T^2 + 120T \]

Divide both sides by \( T \) (assuming \( T \neq 0 \)):
\[ 4T' = 3T + 120 \]
\[ T' = \frac{3T + 120}{4} \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) it takes for the lakad to reach the coffee shop when Siya is naglalakad at \( s \) kilometers. The time \( t \) is the same in all scenarios, so we can use the speed and the distance \( s \):
\[ t = \frac{s}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{s}{\frac{s}{T}} = T \]

However, we need to express \( t \) in terms of \( T \). From the first scenario:
\[ t = \frac{s}{\frac{s}{T}} = T \]

Since \( s = \frac{2T}{120 - T} \):
\[ t = \frac{\frac{2T}{120 - T}}{\frac{\frac{2T}{120 - T}}{T}} = T \]

Therefore, the time \( t \) is:
\[ t = \frac{120T}{2T} = 60 \]

Thus, the time it takes for the lakad to reach the coffee shop is:
\[ \boxed{60} \] minutes.","[60, '60']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by using the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle and a line through \(D\) intersecting the circle at points \(B\) and \(C\), the power of the point \(D\) with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the chord \(BC\). This power is also equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to the circle.

Given that \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we can use the Power of a Point theorem at point \(D\) to find the length of \(AP\).

First, we calculate the length of the tangent from \(D\) to the circle. Let \(t\) be the length of the tangent from \(D\) to the circle. Then, we have:
\[
t^2 = DB \cdot DC
\]
Since \(DB + DC = BC = 9\), we can express \(DC\) as \(9 - DB\). Therefore, we have:
\[
t^2 = DB \cdot (9 - DB)
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(AD\) is a chord of the circle and \(P\) is the other intersection point of \(AD\) with the circle. By the Power of a Point theorem, we have:
\[
AP \cdot PD = t^2
\]
Since \(PD = AD - AP\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
AP \cdot (AD - AP) = t^2
\]

To find \(AD\), we use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). The length of the tangent from a point to a circle is given by:
\[
t = \sqrt{AB^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{AC^2 - r^2}
\]
where \(r\) is the radius of the circle. However, we can also use the fact that the power of the point \(D\) is equal to the product of the segments of the chord \(BC\):
\[
t^2 = DB \cdot DC
\]

We can use the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle in terms of the sides of the triangle:
\[
t^2 = \frac{AB^2 \cdot AC^2 - (AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2) \cdot AB^2 \cdot AC^2}{AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2}
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
t^2 = \frac{5^2 \cdot 10^2 - (5^2 + 10^2 - 9^2) \cdot 5^2 \cdot 10^2}{5^2 + 10^2 + 9^2} = \frac{25 \cdot 100 - (25 + 100 - 81) \cdot 25 \cdot 100}{25 + 100 + 81} = \frac{2500 - 44 \cdot 2500}{206} = \frac{2500 - 110000}{206} = \frac{-107500}{206} = \frac{225}{4}
\]

Therefore, we have:
\[
t^2 = \frac{225}{4}
\]

Now, we substitute \(t^2\) back into the equation \(AP \cdot (AD - AP) = t^2\):
\[
AP \cdot (AD - AP) = \frac{225}{4}
\]

To find \(AD\), we use the fact that \(AD\) is the sum of the tangents from \(A\) to the circle:
\[
AD = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos(\angle BAC)}
\]
Using the Law of Cosines, we get:
\[
\cos(\angle BAC) = \frac{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}{2 \cdot AB \cdot AC} = \frac{25 + 100 - 81}{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10} = \frac{44}{100} = \frac{11}{25}
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
AD = \sqrt{25 + 100 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{11}{25}} = \sqrt{25 + 100 - 44} = \sqrt{81} = 9
\]

Substituting \(AD = 9\) into the equation \(AP \cdot (AD - AP) = \frac{225}{4}\), we get:
\[
AP \cdot (9 - AP) = \frac{225}{4}
\]
This is a quadratic equation:
\[
4AP^2 - 36AP + 225 = 0
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(AP = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
AP = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{36^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 225}}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{1296 - 3600}}{8} = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{144}}{8} = \frac{36 \pm 12}{8}
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
AP = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad AP = \frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

Since \(AP\) is the length of the segment from \(A\) to \(P\), and \(P\) is the other intersection point of \(AD\) with the circle, we have:
\[
AP = \frac{45}{8}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(AP\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{45}{8}}
\]

The sum of \(m\) and \(n\) is:
\[
m + n = 45 + 8 = \boxed{53}

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen vertex of a regular octagon is the same as one of the vertices of a square inscribed in the octagon, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the vertices of the octagon and the square:**
   A regular octagon has 8 vertices. A square inscribed in the octagon will have 4 vertices, which are also vertices of the octagon.

2. **Determine the number of vertices of the octagon that are vertices of the square:**
   The square inscribed in the octagon will have 4 vertices that are also vertices of the octagon.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that a randomly chosen vertex of the octagon is the same as one of the vertices of the square is the ratio of the number of vertices of the octagon that are vertices of the square to the total number of vertices of the octagon. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

4. **Express the probability in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers:**
   Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 2\). Since 1 and 2 are coprime, the fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\) is in its simplest form.

5. **Calculate \(m + n\):**
   \[
   m + n = 1 + 2 = 3

Thus, the value of \(m + n\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",371,"[371, '371']",True
"To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the functions involved and their intersections.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \]

Next, we need to understand the composition of these functions. Let's start with \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \):
\[ f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \]
Since \( |\sin(2 \pi x)| \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, let's consider \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \):
\[ g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \left| |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{4} \]
Since \( |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \left| |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) ranges from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, let's consider \( 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \):
\[ 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
Since \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \), \( 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) ranges from \( -1 \) to \( 1 \).

Similarly, let's consider \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \):
\[ f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \]
Since \( |\cos(3 \pi y)| \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, let's consider \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
\[ g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \left| |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{4} \]
Since \( |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \left| |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) ranges from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, let's consider \( 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
\[ 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]
Since \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) ranges from \( -\frac{1}{4} \) to \( \frac{1}{4} \), \( 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) ranges from \( -1 \) to \( 1 \).

The graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are symmetric about the line \( y = x \). To find the number of intersections, we need to determine how many times the curve \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) intersects the curve \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \).

Since both functions range from \( -1 \) to \( 1 \), we need to consider the behavior of the functions within this range. The function \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \) is symmetric about \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \), and the function \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \) is also symmetric about \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \). Therefore, the function \( 4 g(f(x)) \) is symmetric about \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).

The function \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) completes one full cycle in the interval \( [0, 1] \), and the function \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) completes one full cycle in the same interval. Similarly, the function \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) completes one full cycle in the interval \( [0, 1] \), and the function \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) completes one full cycle in the same interval.

Since the functions are symmetric and complete one full cycle in the same interval, the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will intersect at 4 points.

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given condition that \( n^4 + 1 \) is a perfect square of a prime number \( p \). This means there exists an integer \( k \) such that

\[ n^4 + 1 = p^2. \]

Rearranging this equation, we get

\[ p^2 - n^4 = 1. \]

This can be factored as

\[ (p - n^2)(p + n^2) = 1. \]

Since \( p \) and \( n \) are integers, and \( p \) is a prime number, the only possible factor pairs of 1 are \( (1, 1) \) and \( (-1, -1) \). Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

"To determine the volume of the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with given edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we can use the Cayley-Menger determinant.

1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 89 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can compute this determinant step by step. First, we expand along the first row:

\[
288 V^2 = -1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 89 \\
1 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 0
\end{vmatrix} + 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}

\end{vmatrix} - 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 89
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We now compute each of these 3x3 determinants:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 89 \\
1 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = 1(0 \cdot 0 - 89 \cdot 80) - 41(1 \cdot 0 - 89 \cdot 1) + 89(1 \cdot 80 - 0 \cdot 1) = -7120 + 3629 + 7120 = 3629
\]

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = 1(80 \cdot 0 - 89 \cdot 80) - 41(1 \cdot 0 - 89 \cdot 1) + 89(1 \cdot 80 - 80 \cdot 1) = -7120 + 3629 + 0 = -3491
\]

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 \\
1 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = 1(0 \cdot 0 - 89 \cdot 89) - 41(1 \cdot 0 - 89 \cdot 1) + 80(1 \cdot 89 - 0 \cdot 1) = -7921 + 3629 + 7120 = 2828
\]

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 41 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 89
\end{vmatrix} = 1(80 \cdot 89 - 89 \cdot 89) - 41(1 \cdot 89 - 89 \cdot 1) + 80(1 \cdot 89 - 80 \cdot 1) = 0 - 0 + 89 = 89
\]

Substituting these values back into the determinant expression, we get:

\[
288 V^2 = -1 \cdot 3629 + 1 \cdot (-3491) + 1 \cdot 2828 - 1 \cdot 89 = -3629 - 3491 + 2828 - 89 = -4381
\]

Since the determinant is negative, we take the absolute value and divide by 288:

\[
V^2 = \frac{4381}{288} \implies V = \sqrt{\frac{4381}{288}} = \frac{\sqrt{4381}}{\sqrt{288}} = \frac{\sqrt{4381}}{12\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{4381} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{24} = \frac{\sqrt{8762}}{24}
\]

We simplify \(\sqrt{8762}\) as follows:

\[
8762 = 2 \cdot 4381 = 2 \cdot 19^2 \cdot 11 \implies \sqrt{8762} = 19\sqrt{22}
\]

Thus, the volume is:

\[
V = \frac{19\sqrt{22}}{24}
\]

The volume is in the form \(\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}\) where \(m = 19\), \(n = 22\), and \(p = 24\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 19 + 22 + 24 = 65\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the sphere that is tangent to each of the parahabang kahon elements of the body \(\mathcal{B}\), and then determine \( r^2 \) in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime positive integers. Finally, we will find \( p + q \).

First, let's denote the parahabang kahon elements of the body \(\mathcal{B}\) as \( V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4, V_5, V_6 \) with volumes \( V_1 = 23 \) and surface areas \( A_1 = 54 \). Since the sphere is tangent to each of these elements, the radius \( r \) of the sphere is the inradius of the body \(\mathcal{B}\).

The volume \( V \) of a polyhedron with inradius \( r \) and surface area \( A \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} r A \]

For each parahabang kahon element, we have:
\[ V_i = \frac{1}{3} r A_i \]

Given \( V_1 = 23 \) and \( A_1 = 54 \), we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ 23 = \frac{1}{3} r \cdot 54 \]

Solving for \( r \):
\[ 23 = 18r \]
\[ r = \frac{23}{18} \]

Now, we need to find \( r^2 \):
\[ r^2 = \left( \frac{23}{18} \right)^2 = \frac{529}{324} \]

Here, \( p = 529 \) and \( q = 324 \). Since 529 and 324 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), we have:
\[ p + q = 529 + 324 = 853 \]

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each equation using the properties of logarithms. Recall that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\log_b(b) = 1\). Therefore, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting these into the equations, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

We can simplify these equations by canceling out the logarithms:

\[
x \cdot \frac{1}{\log_x(y)} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \cdot \frac{1}{\log_y(x)} = 10
\]

This gives us:

\[
x \cdot \frac{1}{\log_x(y)} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \cdot \frac{1}{\log_y(x)} = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can rewrite the equations as:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

We can further simplify these equations by multiplying both sides by \(\log(y)\) and \(\log(x)\):

\[
x \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

We now have a system of two equations:

\[
x \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
4y \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \quad \text{(2)}
\]

We can solve this system by expressing \(\log(y)\) in terms of \(\log(x)\) from equation (1):

\[
\log(y) = \frac{x \log(x)}{10}
\]

Substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into equation (2):

\[
4y \left(\frac{x \log(x)}{10}\right) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
\frac{4xy \log(x)}{10} = 10 \log(x)
\]

Multiply both sides by 10 to clear the fraction:

\[
4xy \log(x) = 100 \log(x)
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4xy = 100

\[
xy = \frac{100}{4} = 25

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the smallest integer \( n \) such that Bob can guarantee a win against Alice, given that Alice and Bob take turns picking tokens from a pile of \( n \) tokens, and each token picked can either be 1 token or 4 tokens, with Alice going first.

First, let's define the states of the game:
- A state is a number of tokens left in the pile.
- A winning state for Bob is a state where Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves.
- A losing state for Bob is a state where Alice can force a win, regardless of Bob's moves.

We will use dynamic programming to determine the winning and losing states. Let \( W(n) \) be a function that returns true if the state with \( n \) tokens is a winning state for Bob, and false if it is a losing state for Bob.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Base Case:**
   - \( W(0) = \text{false} \): If there are no tokens left, Alice wins immediately.

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - For \( n \geq 1 \):
     - If \( W(n) = \text{true} \), then \( n \) is a winning state for Bob.
     - If \( W(n) = \text{false} \), then \( n \) is a losing state for Bob.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - \( W(n) \) is true if there exists a move that leads to a losing state for Alice.
   - \( W(n) \) is false if every possible move leads to a winning state for Alice.

### Possible Moves:
- Alice can pick 1 token or 4 tokens.
- Therefore, if \( W(n-1) = \text{false} \) or \( W(n-4) = \text{false} \), then \( W(n) = \text{true} \).

### Initial Values:
- \( W(0) = \text{false} \)

### Calculate Values for \( n \geq 1 \):
- \( W(1) = \text{true} \) (Alice can pick 1 token and win)
- \( W(2) = \text{true} \) (Alice can pick 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, who wins)
- \( W(3) = \text{true} \) (Alice can pick 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for Bob, who wins)
- \( W(4) = \text{false} \) (Alice can pick 4 tokens and win)
- \( W(5) = \text{true} \) (Alice can pick 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for Bob, who loses)
- \( W(6) = \text{true} \) (Alice can pick 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for Bob, who wins)
- \( W(7) = \text{true} \) (Alice can pick 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for Bob, who wins)
- \( W(8) = \text{false} \) (Alice can pick 4 tokens and win)

### General Pattern:
From the above calculations, we observe that \( W(n) = \text{true} \) if \( n \) is not a multiple of 5, and \( W(n) = \text{false} \) if \( n \) is a multiple of 5.

### Find the Smallest \( n \) such that \( W(n) = \text{true} \) and \( n \geq 2024 \):
- The smallest multiple of 5 greater than or equal to 2024 is 2025.

Thus, the smallest integer \( n \) such that Bob can guarantee a win against Alice is \(\boxed{2025}\).","[2025, '2025']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To determine the probability that Siya nanalo ng grand prize kung siya ay nanalo ng premyo, we need to consider the conditions under which the grand prize is won. The grand prize is won if the four randomly selected numbers include the number 10. Therefore, we need to calculate the probability that the number 10 is one of the four selected numbers.

First, let's determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of the 10 available numbers. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{10}{4}\):

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that the number 10 is included. If the number 10 is fixed as one of the selected numbers, we need to choose the remaining 3 numbers from the other 9 numbers. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{9}{3}\):

\[
\binom{9}{3} = \frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \frac{9!}{3!6!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84

The probability that Siya nanalo ng grand prize kung siya ay nanalo ng premyo is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of similar triangles and the given lengths of the sides of the quadrilaterals \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\).

First, let's identify the similar triangles. Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, and \(A, D, H, G\) are collinear, we can use the fact that the triangles \(ABD\) and \(EFG\) are similar, and the triangles \(CDH\) and \(CFG\) are similar.

Given:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

We need to find the length of \(CE\).

Since \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are similar quadrilaterals, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{EF} = \frac{BC}{FG}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\frac{107}{184} = \frac{16}{17}
\]

This confirms that the quadrilaterals are indeed similar. Now, we need to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(E, C, F\) are collinear, \(CE\) is the difference between \(CF\) and \(EF\).

First, we need to find \(CF\). Since \(EFGH\) is a quadrilateral, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the other pair of opposite sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
EF + GH = FG + EH
\]

However, we do not have the lengths of \(GH\) and \(EH\). Instead, we can use the fact that \(E, C, F\) are collinear, and the length of \(CE\) is the difference between \(CF\) and \(EF\).

Since \(E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that the length of \(CE\) is the difference between the length of \(CF\) and the length of \(EF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
CE = CF - EF
\]

Since \(CF\) is the sum of \(BC\) and \(EF\), we have:
\[
CF = BC + EF = 16 + 184 = 200

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:
\[
CE = 200 - 184 = 16

"To determine the number of distinct paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, where each path consists of exactly 16 steps (8 right and 8 down), we need to count the number of unique sequences of 8 right moves (R) and 8 down moves (D). This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using binomial coefficients.

The number of distinct paths is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 D's in a sequence of 16 moves. This is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 16 for the R's (or equivalently, the D's).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\) is calculated as follows:

\]

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)

"To solve the problem, we need to find the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) and then sum the numerator and the denominator of the fraction representing the inradius in its simplest form.

First, let's denote the sides of the triangle \(ABC\) as follows:
- \(a = BC\)
- \(b = CA\)
- \(c = AB\)

The inradius \(r\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ r = \frac{A}{s} \]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]

The area \(A\) of the triangle can also be expressed in terms of the inradius and the semi-perimeter:
\[ A = r \cdot s \]

Given that the inradius \(r\) of the triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers, we need to find \(m\) and \(n\).

We are also given that a 2024-sided regular polygon with a radius of 1 has an inradius of 1. The inradius \(r\) of a regular polygon with \(n\) sides and radius \(R\) is given by:
\[ r = R \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{n} \right) \]

For a 2024-sided polygon with \(R = 1\):
\[ r = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2024} \right) \]

Since the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{m}{n}\), we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2024} \right)\) and express it as a fraction in its simplest form.

However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of the triangle \(ABC\). Therefore, we need to use the given information about the 2024-sided polygon to find the inradius of the triangle.

Given that the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{m}{n}\), we can use the fact that the inradius of a regular polygon with a large number of sides approaches 1. Since the problem does not provide specific values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we assume that the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) is close to 1.

Thus, we can approximate:
\[ \frac{m}{n} \approx 1 \]

This implies that \(m = 1\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[ m + n = 1 + 1 = 2 \]

However, since the problem asks for the exact value of \(m + n\) and we do not have enough information to determine the exact values of \(m\) and \(n\), we need to consider the possibility that the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) is a fraction that is not exactly 1 but close to it.

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The hyperbola is centered at the origin with a horizontal transverse axis. The vertices of the hyperbola are located at \((\pm a, 0)\), where \(a^2 = 20\), so \(a = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\). The foci of the hyperbola are located at \((\pm c, 0)\), where \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 20 + 24 = 44\), so \(c = \sqrt{44} = 2\sqrt{11}\).

Given that \(ABCD\) is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at right angles at the center of the hyperbola, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are the axes of symmetry of the rhombus.

The length of diagonal \(BD\) can be found by considering that the endpoints of \(BD\) lie on the hyperbola. Let \(B = (x_1, y_1)\) and \(D = (x_2, y_2)\). Since \(BD\) is perpendicular to the transverse axis, \(x_1 = x_2\) and \(y_1 = -y_2\). Therefore, the length of \(BD\) is \(2|y_1|\).

To find \(|y_1|\), we substitute \(x_1 = x\) into the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{y_1^2}{24} = \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \implies y_1^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \right) = 24 \left( \frac{x^2 - 20}{20} \right) = \frac{24(x^2 - 20)}{20} = \frac{6(x^2 - 20)}{5}.
\]
Since \(x_1 = x_2\) and the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the maximum value of \(|y_1|\) occurs when \(x = 0\):

y_1^2 = \frac{6(2\sqrt{5}^2 - 20)}{5} = \frac{6(20 - 20)}{5} = 0 \quad \text{(which is not possible)}.
\]

Therefore, the length of \(BD\) is \(2|y_1| = 2 \times 4 = 8\).

The length of \(BD^2\) is:
\[
BD^2 = 8^2 = 64.

"To determine the number of residents of Aimeville who may-ari ng lahat ng apat na bagay, we need to find the number of residents who may-ari ng at least one of the three types of bagay: candy hearts, eksaktong dalawa, or eksaktong tatlo. We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for this purpose.

Let's define the sets:
- Let \( A \) be the set of residents who may-ari ng candy hearts.
- Let \( B \) be the set of residents who may-ari ng eksaktong dalawa.
- Let \( C \) be the set of residents who may-ari ng eksaktong tatlo.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of residents is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of residents who may-ari ng candy hearts is \( |A| = 437 \).
- The number of residents who may-ari ng eksaktong dalawa is \( |B| = 234 \).
- The number of residents who may-ari ng eksaktong tatlo is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of residents who may-ari ng candy hearts and eksaktong dalawa is \( |A \cap B| = 195 \).
- The number of residents who may-ari ng candy hearts and eksaktong tatlo is \( |A \cap C| = 195 \).
- The number of residents who may-ari ng eksaktong dalawa and eksaktong tatlo is \( |B \cap C| = 367 \).
- The number of residents who may-ari ng candy hearts, eksaktong dalawa, and eksaktong tatlo is \( |A \cap B \cap C| = 437 \).

We need to find the number of residents who may-ari ng at least one of the three types of bagay, which is \( |A \cup B \cup C| \). According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|
\]

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = 437 + 234 + 562 - 195 - 195 - 367 + 437
\]

First, let's add the individual sets:
\[
437 + 234 = 671
\]
\[
671 + 562 = 1233
\]

Next, let's add the intersections:
\[
195 + 195 = 390
\]
\[
390 + 367 = 757
\]

Now, substitute these results back into the formula:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = 1233 - 757 + 437
\]

First, subtract 757 from 1233:
\[
1233 - 757 = 476
\]

Then, add 437 to 476:
\[
476 + 437 = 913
\]

Therefore, the number of residents of Aimeville who may-ari ng lahat ng apat na bagay is \(\boxed{913}\).","[913, '913']",73,"[73, '73']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by using the given information about the triangle \( \triangle ABC \). The circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) are given, and we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). The circumradius \( R \) is 13, and the inradius \( r \) is 6.

First, we use the formula for the distance between the incenter and the circumcenter of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). The length \( IA \) is the distance from the incenter to a vertex of the triangle, which can be expressed as:
\[
IA = \sqrt{R(R - 2r) + r^2} = \sqrt{13 \cdot 1 + 6^2} = \sqrt{13 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we use the formula for the area \( \Delta \) of a triangle in terms of its circumradius \( R \) and inradius \( r \):
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. We also know that:
\[
\Delta = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

Using the relationship between the area, circumradius, and inradius, we can find the product \( ab \cdot bc \cdot ca \):
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
\[
abc = 4R \cdot r \cdot s
\]

We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \), which is \( bc \). To do this, we use the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \). In a right triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is half the hypotenuse, and the inradius \( r \) is given by:
\[
r = \frac{a + b - c}{2}
\]
where \( c \) is the hypotenuse. Since \( R = 13 \), we have:
\[
c = 2R = 26
\]

Using the inradius formula:
\[
6 = \frac{a + b - 26}{2}
\]
\[
12 = a + b - 26
\]
\[
a + b = 38
\]

The area \( \Delta \) of the right triangle is:
\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2}ab
\]
We also have:
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = 6 \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2} = 6 \cdot \frac{38 + 26}{2} = 6 \cdot 32 = 192
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}ab = 192
\]
\[
ab = 384
\]

Since \( ab = bc \) in a right triangle with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \), we have:
\[
ab = 384

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To solve for the number of triplets \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the second equation. Notice that we can factor the left-hand side as follows:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]

Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]

Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:

\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We can express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\) from the first equation:

\[
c = 300 - a - b.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we have:

\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation in \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]

To find the integer solutions, we can use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are non-negative integers and \(a + b + c = 300\). We will test possible values for \(a\) and solve for \(b\) and \(c\).

First, let's assume \(a = 100\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
100^2 + b^2 + 100b - 300 \cdot 100 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
10,000 + b^2 - 200b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b + 30,000 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\), where \(A = 1\), \(B = -200\), and \(C = 30,000\), we get:

\[
b = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{200^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 30,000}}{2 \cdot 1},
\]
\[
b = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{40,000 - 120,000}}{2},
\]
\[
b = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{-80,000}}{2}.
\]

Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for \(b\). Therefore, \(a = 100\) is not a valid solution.

Next, let's assume \(a = 100\) and \(b = 100\). Then \(c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100\). Substituting \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:

\[
100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 = 30,000 \neq 20,000.
\]

Therefore, \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\) is not a valid solution.

We need to find other possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). By symmetry and the nature of the problem, we can see that the only valid solution is when \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\). However, this does not satisfy the second equation.

After further analysis, we find that the only valid solution is when \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\). Therefore, the number of triplets \((a, b, c)\) is:

\[
\boxed{1}.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \(OC^2\) where \(C\) is a point on the segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(OC\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\) and \(C\) is not on any segment in the family \(\mathcal{F}\). The points \(A\) and \(B\) are given as \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).

First, we find the equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\). The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, the equation of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we find the coordinates of point \(C\). Since \(C\) is on the line \(\overline{AB}\), we can express \(C\) as \((x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). The distance from the origin \(O\) to \(C\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}}
\]
Since \(OC\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\), the slope of \(OC\) is the negative reciprocal of the slope of \(\overline{AB}\), which is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\). The equation of \(OC\) is:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]
To find the coordinates of \(C\), we solve the system of equations:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]
Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Adding \(\sqrt{3}x\) to both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Dividing both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{4}{3}x = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into the equation \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

Finally, we calculate \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{12}{64} = \frac{3}{16}

Here, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), and since \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime, we have:
\[
p + q = 3 + 16 = 19

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given expression:

where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, meaning \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:

\[
(x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0

Thus, the 13th roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\), where \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\).

"To determine the largest integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) that is \( b \)-beautiful, we need to find \( n \) such that \( n \) is a perfect square and the sum of its digits in base \( b \) is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's consider the properties of \( n \). If \( n \) is a perfect square, then \( \sqrt{n} \) is an integer. Let \( \sqrt{n} = k \), where \( k \) is a positive integer. Therefore, \( n = k^2 \).

In base \( b \), the number \( n \) can be expressed as a sum of its digits. Let the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) be \( d_m, d_{m-1}, \ldots, d_1, d_0 \). Then, we have:

To find the largest possible \( b \), we need to check the constraints imposed by the sum of the digits and the perfect square condition. Let's start with small values of \( b \) and see if we can find a suitable \( n \).

### Case \( b = 2 \)
In base 2, the digits are 0 and 1. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 2, \( 1 = 1_2 \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 2-beautiful.

### Case \( b = 3 \)
In base 3, the digits are 0, 1, and 2. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 3, \( 1 = 1_3 \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 3-beautiful.

### Case \( b = 4 \)
In base 4, the digits are 0, 1, 2, and 3. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 4, \( 1 = 1_4 \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 4-beautiful.

### Case \( b = 5 \)
In base 5, the digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 5, \( 1 = 1_5 \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 5-beautiful.

### Case \( b = 6 \)
In base 6, the digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 6, \( 1 = 1_6 \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 6-beautiful.

### Case \( b = 7 \)
In base 7, the digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 7, \( 1 = 1_7 \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 7-beautiful.

### Case \( b = 8 \)
In base 8, the digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 8, \( 1 = 1_8 \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 8-beautiful.

### Case \( b = 9 \)
In base 9, the digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 9, \( 1 = 1_9 \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 9-beautiful.

### Case \( b = 10 \)
In base 10, the digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( k \), and \( n \) must be a perfect square. The smallest \( k \) is 1, so \( n = 1 \). In base 10, \( 1 = 1_{10} \), and the sum of the digits is 1, which is equal to \( \sqrt{1} \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is 10-beautiful.

From the above cases, we see that the largest integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) that is \( b \)-beautiful is \( b = 10 \).

Thus, the answer is:

\boxed{10}

"To determine the number of parahabas that can be drawn in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) such that each parahabana passes through one vertex and one diagonal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the vertices and diagonals of the dodecagon:**
   A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. The number of diagonals in a polygon with \( n \) vertices is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n(n-3)}{2}
   \]
   For a dodecagon, \( n = 12 \):
   \[
   \frac{12(12-3)}{2} = \frac{12 \times 9}{2} = 54
   \]
   So, there are 54 diagonals in a dodecagon.

2. **Determine the number of parahabas:**
   Each parahabana is a line segment that connects one vertex to one diagonal. Since each diagonal connects two vertices, each diagonal can be part of two parahabas (one for each vertex it connects). Therefore, the total number of parahabas is twice the number of diagonals:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108
   \]

3. **Verify the diagram:**
   The diagram provided shows that each parahabana passes through one vertex and one diagonal. The specific parahabas shown in the diagram are:
   - From vertex 210 to diagonal 210-240
   - From vertex 210 to diagonal 240-30
   - From vertex 210 to diagonal 30-60
   - From vertex 210 to diagonal 60-210
   - From vertex 240 to diagonal 240-30
   - From vertex 240 to diagonal 30-60
   - From vertex 240 to diagonal 60-210
   - From vertex 30 to diagonal 30-60
   - From vertex 30 to diagonal 60-210
   - From vertex 60 to diagonal 60-210
   - From vertex 60 to diagonal 210-240

"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions:
1. The sum of the integers is 30.
2. The mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that is not in the list.

Let's start by considering the mode condition. Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's denote the list by \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n\). The median is the middle number if \(n\) is odd, or the average of the two middle numbers if \(n\) is even. Since the median is a positive integer and not in the list, \(n\) must be even, and the median will be the average of the \(\frac{n}{2}\)-th and \(\frac{n}{2}+1\)-th elements.

Let's try to find a list with the smallest possible number of elements. If \(n = 4\), the list could be \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\) with \(a_2 = a_3\) and \(a_2 + a_3 = 2a_2 = 9\), so \(a_2 = 9\). The list would be \(a_1, 9, 9, a_4\) with \(a_1 + 9 + 9 + a_4 = 30\), so \(a_1 + a_4 = 12\). To ensure that 9 is the only mode, \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) must be different from 9 and each other. The smallest possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) are 1 and 11, respectively. Therefore, the list is \(1, 9, 9, 11\).

Let's verify the conditions:
- The sum of the integers is \(1 + 9 + 9 + 11 = 30\).
- The mode of the list is 9.
- The median is \(\frac{9 + 9}{2} = 9\), which is not in the list.

Thus, the list \(1, 9, 9, 11\) satisfies all the conditions. The list has 4 elements, and the number of pairs of integers in the list is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",236,"[236, '236']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the digits in each row and each column matches the given totals. The totals are as follows:
- The sum of the digits in the first row is 999.
- The sum of the digits in the second row is 99.
- The sum of the digits in the first column is 999.
- The sum of the digits in the second column is 99.
- The sum of the digits in the third column is 99.

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

From the given totals, we can write the following equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 999\)
2. \(d + e + f = 99\)
3. \(a + d = 999\)
4. \(b + e = 99\)
5. \(c + f = 99\)

We can start by analyzing the equations. From equation 3, we see that \(d = 999 - a\). From equation 4, we see that \(e = 99 - b\). From equation 5, we see that \(f = 99 - c\).

Substituting these into equation 2, we get:
\[
(999 - a) + (99 - b) + (99 - c) = 99
\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
1197 - a - b - c = 99
\]
Subtracting 99 from both sides, we get:
\[
1197 - a - b - c = 99
\]
Subtracting 99 from both sides, we get:
\[
1197 - a - b - c = 99
\]
Subtracting 99 from both sides, we get:
\[
1197 - a - b - c = 99
\]
Subtracting 99 from both sides, we get:
\[
1197 - a - b - c = 99
\]
Subtracting 99 from both sides, we get:
\[
1197 - a - b - c = 99
\]
Subtracting 99 from both sides, we get:
\[
1197 - a - b - c = 99
\]

From equation 1, we see that \(a + b + c = 999\). Substituting \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), and \(c = 8\) into the equation, we get:
\[
0 + 0 + 8 = 999
\]

Therefore, the grid is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting each logarithmic equation into its exponential form. The equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = 1
\]

This equation is not possible unless the exponents are zero, which means the original equations must be consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, we need to solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other.

From the first equation:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2} \implies x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

From the second equation:

\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \implies y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

From the third equation:

\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} \implies z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

We substitute \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
y = (yz \sqrt{2}) z 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

Since \(y \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(y\):

\[
1 = z^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

We substitute \(z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\) into \(1 = z^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
1 = (xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}})^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = x^2 y^2 2^{\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\frac{1}{4}} \sqrt{2} = x^2 y^2 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}} = x^2 y^2 2^{\frac{5}{4}}
\]

Since \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\), we substitute \(z = \frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\) into \(1 = x^2 y^2 2^{\frac{5}{4}}\):

\[
1 = x^2 y^2 2^{\frac{5}{4}}
\]

We solve for \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of \(z\):

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2} \implies x = y \left(\frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\right) \sqrt{2} = x
\]

This is consistent. We need to find \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (yz \sqrt{2})^4 y^3 \left(\frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = y^4 z^4 2^2 y^3 \frac{x^2}{y^2 2} = y^5 z^4 2^3 = y^5 z^4 8
\]

We substitute \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\) and \(z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = x^4 (xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}})^3 (xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}})^2 = x^4 x^3 z^3 2 = x^7 z^3 2
\]

We substitute \(z = \frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = x^4 y^3 \left(\frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = x^4 y^3 \frac{x^2}{y^2 2} = x^6 y z^2
\]

We substitute \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = x^4 (xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}})^3 z^2 = x^4 x^3 z^3 2 = x^7 z^3 2
\]

We substitute \(z = \frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = x^4 y^3 \left(\frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = x^4 y^3 \frac{x^2}{y^2 2} = x^6 y z^2
\]

We substitute \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = x^4 (xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}})^3 z^2 = x^4 x^3 z^3 2 = x^7 z^3 2
\]

We substitute \(z = \frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = x^4 y^3 \left(\frac{x}{y \sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = x^4 y^3 \frac{x^2}{y^2 2} = x^6 y z^2

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the sixth side of the convex equilateral hexagon \(ABCDEF\) given that the opposite sides are parallel and the lengths of the other five sides are 200, 240, 300, 240, and 200.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are of equal length. Let's denote the length of each side by \(s\). The hexagon can be divided into two parallel sides and four other sides, with the opposite sides being equal.

Given the lengths of the sides \(AB = 200\), \(CD = 240\), \(EF = 300\), \(BC = 240\), and \(DE = 200\), we need to find the length of the sixth side \(FA\).

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the length of each side must be the same. Therefore, the length of the sixth side \(FA\) must be equal to the length of the other sides. However, we need to check if the given side lengths can form a valid hexagon with equal sides.

The sum of the lengths of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), \(EF\), \(BC\), and \(DE\) is:
\[200 + 240 + 300 + 240 + 200 = 1180.\]

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the total perimeter of the hexagon is \(6s\). Therefore, we have:
\[6s = 1180.\]

Solving for \(s\), we get:
\[s = \frac{1180}{6} = 196.67.\]

However, this value of \(s\) does not match any of the given side lengths. Therefore, the given side lengths cannot form a valid hexagon with equal sides.

Thus, the correct interpretation is that the given side lengths are not the sides of the hexagon but the extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\). The length of the sixth side \(FA\) must be the same as the other sides, which is the average of the given side lengths.

   - This means that \( B \) is a subset of the set of positive integers that does not intersect \( A \).

3. **Number of Possible Sets \( B \):**
   - The number of subsets of a set with \( n \) elements is \( 2^n \).
   - Since Bob can list 2024 such sets \( B \), we have \( 2^n \leq 2024 \).

4. **Finding \( n \):**
   - We need to find the largest \( n \) such that \( 2^n \leq 2024 \).
   - Calculating powers of 2:
     \[
     2^{10} = 1024
     \]
     \[
     2^{11} = 2048
     \]
   - Therefore, \( n = 10 \) is the largest integer such that \( 2^n \leq 2024 \).

5. **Set \( A \):**
   - Since \( B \) is a subset of the set of positive integers that does not intersect \( A \), and there are 10 elements in \( B \), the set \( A \) must contain the remaining positive integers.
   - The set of positive integers is infinite, but the set \( A \) must contain all positive integers except those in \( B \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The set \( A \) must contain all positive integers except the 10 elements in \( B \).
   - Since \( B \) is a subset of the set of positive integers that does not intersect \( A \), the set \( A \) must contain all positive integers except the 10 elements in \( B \).

Thus, the set \( A \) contains all positive integers except the 10 elements in \( B \). The number of elements in \( A \) is infinite.

"To solve the problem, we need to find a positive integer \( N \) such that when \( N \) is divided by 1000, the quotient is \( Q \) and the remainder is \( R \), and the number formed by the digits of \( N \) (with the digit 1 replacing the digit 0) is divisible by 7. We need to find \( Q + R \).

First, let's express \( N \) in terms of \( Q \) and \( R \):
\[ N = 1000Q + R \]
where \( 0 \leq R < 1000 \).

The number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 in \( N \) is:
\[ M = 1000Q + R + 1000 - R = 1000Q + 1000 = 1000(Q + 1) \]

We need \( M \) to be divisible by 7:
\[ 1000(Q + 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

Since 1000 is not divisible by 7, \( Q + 1 \) must be divisible by 7:
\[ Q + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ Q \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ Q \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

So, \( Q \) can be written as:
\[ Q = 7k + 6 \]
for some integer \( k \).

Next, we need to find the smallest positive \( N \) such that \( Q + R < 1000 \). The smallest \( Q \) is 6, so:
\[ N = 1000Q + R = 1000 \cdot 6 + R = 6000 + R \]

We need \( R \) to be such that \( N \) is a positive integer and the number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 in \( N \) is divisible by 7. Since \( N = 6000 + R \), the number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 is:
\[ M = 6000 + 1 = 6001 \]

We need to check if 6001 is divisible by 7:
\[ 6001 \div 7 = 857.2857 \]

Since 6001 is not divisible by 7, we need to find the next \( Q \) and \( R \) such that \( N \) is a positive integer and the number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 in \( N \) is divisible by 7. The next \( Q \) is 13, so:
\[ N = 1000 \cdot 13 + R = 13000 + R \]

We need \( R \) to be such that \( N \) is a positive integer and the number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 in \( N \) is divisible by 7. Since \( N = 13000 + R \), the number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 is:
\[ M = 13000 + 1 = 13001 \]

We need to check if 13001 is divisible by 7:
\[ 13001 \div 7 = 1857.2857 \]

Since 13001 is not divisible by 7, we need to find the next \( Q \) and \( R \) such that \( N \) is a positive integer and the number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 in \( N \) is divisible by 7. The next \( Q \) is 20, so:
\[ N = 1000 \cdot 20 + R = 20000 + R \]

We need \( R \) to be such that \( N \) is a positive integer and the number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 in \( N \) is divisible by 7. Since \( N = 20000 + R \), the number formed by replacing the digit 0 with the digit 1 is:
\[ M = 20000 + 1 = 20001 \]

We need to check if 20001 is divisible by 7:
\[ 20001 \div 7 = 2857 \]

Since 20001 is divisible by 7, we have:
\[ Q = 20 \]
\[ R = 1 \]

So, \( Q + R = 20 + 1 = 21 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the two circles where the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \), and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's define the parameters:
- The radius of the torus \( T \) is \( R = 3 \).
- The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere \( S \) is \( D = 6 \).
- The radius of the sphere \( S \) is \( R_S = 11 \).

The torus \( T \) can be thought of as a circle of radius \( R \) that is revolved around a circle of radius \( D \). The distance from the center of the sphere \( S \) to any point on the surface of the torus is the sum of the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus and the radius of the torus, which is \( D + R = 6 + 3 = 9 \).

When the torus is tangent to the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the surface of the torus is \( R_S - r_i \) at the inner point of tangency and \( R_S + r_o \) at the outer point of tangency. Since the torus is tangent to the sphere, these distances must equal the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus plus the radius of the torus, which is 9.

Thus, we have:
\[ R_S - r_i = 9 \]
\[ R_S + r_o = 9 \]

Solving these equations for \( r_i \) and \( r_o \):
\[ r_i = R_S - 9 = 11 - 9 = 2 \]
\[ r_o = R_S - 9 = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 2 - 2 = 0 \]

Therefore, the value of \( m + n \) is:
\[ m = 0, \quad n = 1 \]
\[ m + n = 0 + 1 = 1 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of chips that can be placed in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that no two chips are in the same row or column, and no two chips are in the same diagonal (both main and anti-diagonals). This is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics known as the ""N-Queens Problem"" with additional constraints.

First, let's consider the constraints:
1. No two chips are in the same row.
2. No two chips are in the same column.
3. No two chips are on the same diagonal (both main and anti-diagonals).

We can represent the grid as a \(5 \times 5\) matrix where each cell can either contain a chip or be empty. Let's denote the cell in the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column as \((i, j)\).

We need to find a permutation of the rows such that no two chips are on the same diagonal. This is equivalent to finding a permutation \(\sigma\) of the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) such that the sums \(i + \sigma(i)\) and \(i - \sigma(i)\) are not equal to any other sum \(j + \sigma(j)\) or \(j - \sigma(j)\) for \(i \neq j\).

Let's try to find such a permutation. One possible solution is:
\[
\sigma = (1, 3, 5, 2, 4)
\]
This means that the chip in row 1 is in column 3, the chip in row 2 is in column 5, the chip in row 3 is in column 1, the chip in row 4 is in column 2, and the chip in row 5 is in column 4.

Let's verify that this permutation satisfies the constraints:
- No two chips are in the same row.
- No two chips are in the same column.
- The sums of the row and column indices are:
  - For row 1 and column 3: \(1 + 3 = 4\)
  - For row 2 and column 5: \(2 + 5 = 7\)
  - For row 3 and column 1: \(3 + 1 = 4\)
  - For row 4 and column 2: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
  - For row 5 and column 4: \(5 + 4 = 9\)

  The sums are all distinct, so no two chips are on the same diagonal.

Therefore, the maximum number of chips that can be placed in the grid is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",902,"[902, '902']",False
