"To solve the problem, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the given information. Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - \( s \) is the speed in km/h.
   - \( t \) is the time in minutes spent at the coffee shop.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - When the speed is \( s \) km/h, the total time for the trip is 4 hours. The time spent driving is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours, and the time spent at the coffee shop is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
   - When the speed is \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time for the trip is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is \( 2.4 \) hours. The time spent driving is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours, and the time spent at the coffee shop is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
     \]

3. **Eliminate the time spent at the coffee shop:**
   - Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
     \[
     \left( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 2.4 - 4
     \]
     Simplify the left side:
     \[
     \frac{9}{s+2} - \frac{9}{s} = -1.6
     \]
     Factor out the 9:
     \[
     9 \left( \frac{1}{s+2} - \frac{1}{s} \right) = -1.6
     \]
     Combine the fractions inside the parentheses:
     \[
     9 \left( \frac{s - (s+2)}{s(s+2)} \right) = -1.6
     \]
     Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     9 \left( \frac{-2}{s(s+2)} \right) = -1.6
     \]
     Simplify the left side:
     \[
     \frac{-18}{s(s+2)} = -1.6
     \]
     Eliminate the negative signs:
     \[
     \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
     \]
     Convert 1.6 to a fraction:
     \[
     \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = \frac{8}{5}
     \]
     Cross-multiply to solve for \( s \):
     \[
     18 \cdot 5 = 8 \cdot s(s+2)
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     90 = 8s^2 + 16s
     \]
     Rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:
     \[
     8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0
     \]
     Simplify by dividing by 2:
     \[
     4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
     \]
     Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -45 \):
     \[
     s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-45)}}{2 \cdot 4}
     \]
     Simplify inside the square root:
     \[
     s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
     \]
     This gives us two solutions:
     \[
     s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-36}{8} = -4.5
     \]
     Since speed cannot be negative, we have:
     \[
     s = 2.5 \text{ km/h}
     \]

4. **Find the time spent at the coffee shop:**
   - Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the first equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]
     Subtract 3.6 from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{t}{60} = 0.4
     \]
     Multiply both sides by 60:
     \[
     t = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Find the total time for the trip when the speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:**
   - The time spent driving is:
     \[
     \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The time spent at the coffee shop is:
     \[
     \frac{t}{60} = \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \text{ hours} = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The total time for the trip is:
     \[
     3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Convert 3.4 hours to minutes:
     \[
     3.4 \times 60 = 204 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip when the speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.","[204, '204']",204,"[204, '204']",True
"To solve for \(AP\) in the given problem, we start by using the properties of the incircle and the power of a point theorem. Let's denote the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\) by \(I\). Since \(D\) is the point where the incircle touches \(BC\), \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\).

First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\) of \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12.
\]

Next, we find the area \(K\) of \(\triangle ABC\) using Heron's formula:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-10)(12-9)(12-5)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}.
\]

The inradius \(r\) of \(\triangle ABC\) is given by:
\[
r = \frac{K}{s} = \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}.
\]

The length of \(BD\) and \(CD\) can be found using the formula for the tangents from a point to a circle:
\[
BD = s - AC = 12 - 10 = 2, \quad CD = s - AB = 12 - 5 = 7.
\]

Since \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\), we use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that:
\[
\frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Now, we use the power of a point theorem at point \(D\) with respect to the incircle:
\[
AD \cdot AP = BD \cdot CD = 2 \cdot 7 = 14.
\]

To find \(AD\), we use the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle:
\[
AD = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB+AC)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5+10)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \left(\frac{144}{225}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \cdot \frac{16}{25}} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}.
\]

Now, we can find \(AP\):
\[
AP = \frac{BD \cdot CD}{AD} = \frac{14}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{4}.
\]

Since \(AP = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{4}\) is already in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 7\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 4\), and \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 7 + 4 = 11.
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly coloring the vertices of a square and then rotating the square, all the blue vertices end up in the positions of the red vertices. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the vertices and their colors:**
   - A square has 4 vertices.
   - Each vertex can be either red or blue with equal probability, so there are \(2^4 = 16\) possible colorings of the square.

2. **Determine the number of favorable colorings:**
   - A favorable coloring is one where the blue vertices are in the positions of the red vertices after a rotation. This means that the blue vertices must be in opposite positions relative to the red vertices.
   - There are 2 possible ways to color the square such that the blue vertices are in opposite positions:
     - One vertex is blue and the opposite vertex is blue.
     - The other two vertices are red and the other two vertices are red.
   - For each of these configurations, there are 2 possible rotations (0 degrees and 180 degrees) that will map the blue vertices to the red vertices. Therefore, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) favorable colorings.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

4. **Express the probability in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime:**
   - Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 4\), which are coprime.

5. **Find \(m + n\):**
   \[
   m + n = 1 + 4 = 5
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions and their properties step by step.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \]

Next, we need to find the expressions for \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
\[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ g(\cos(3\pi y)) = |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we can write the equations for the graphs:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4 \left( |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{4} = 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| - 2 - \frac{1}{4} = 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{9}{4} \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = 4 \left( |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \right) - \frac{1}{4} = 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| - 2 - \frac{1}{4} = 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{9}{4} \]

To find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations:
\[ y = 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{9}{4} \]
\[ x = 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{9}{4} \]

Let's denote \( y = a \) and \( x = b \). Then we have:
\[ a = 4 |\sin(2\pi b)| - \frac{9}{4} \]
\[ b = 4 |\cos(3\pi a)| - \frac{9}{4} \]

Since \( |\sin(2\pi b)| \) and \( |\cos(3\pi a)| \) are both in the interval \([0, 1]\), the values of \( a \) and \( b \) must satisfy:
\[ -\frac{9}{4} \leq a \leq 4 \left(1\right) - \frac{9}{4} = \frac{7}{4} \]
\[ -\frac{9}{4} \leq b \leq 4 \left(1\right) - \frac{9}{4} = \frac{7}{4} \]

Now, let's analyze the behavior of the functions \( y = 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{9}{4} \) and \( x = 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{9}{4} \) within the interval \([- \frac{7}{4}, \frac{7}{4}]\).

The function \( y = 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{9}{4} \) is periodic with period \(\frac{1}{2}\) and its values range from \(-\frac{9}{4}\) to \frac{7}{4} - \frac{9}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}\).

The function \( x = 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{9}{4} \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and its values range from \(-\frac{9}{4}\) to \frac{7}{4} - \frac{9}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}\).

To find the number of intersection points, we need to count the number of solutions to the equation \( y = 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{9}{4} \) and \( x = 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{9}{4} \) within the interval \([- \frac{7}{4}, \frac{7}{4}]\).

Since both functions are periodic and their ranges overlap, we can use the fact that each function completes a certain number of cycles within the interval \([- \frac{7}{4}, \frac{7}{4}]\).

The function \( y = 4 |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{9}{4} \) completes 7 cycles within the interval \([- \frac{7}{4}, \frac{7}{4}]\), and the function \( x = 4 |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{9}{4} \) completes 7 cycles within the interval \([- \frac{7}{4}, \frac{7}{4}]\).

Each cycle of one function intersects each cycle of the other function exactly once, so the total number of intersection points is:
\[ 7 \times 7 = 49 \]

Therefore, the number of intersection points of the graphs is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the condition that \( p \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). This implies that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \) and \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

First, we use the fact that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \). This means that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \). Therefore, the order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) must be 8. This implies that \( p-1 \) must be divisible by 8, so \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).

Next, we use the fact that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This means that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \). We can write \( n^8 = (n^4)^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \). Since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), we have \( (-1)^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \), which is true. However, we need to check the exact order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \).

We use the fact that \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \) and \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be 8. Therefore, \( p^2 - 1 \) must be divisible by 8, so \( p^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). Since \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \), \( p^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) is satisfied.

The smallest prime \( p \) that satisfies \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) is \( p = 17 \). We need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( 17^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \). We have:
\[ 17^4 + 1 = 83521 + 1 = 83522. \]
We check if \( 83522 \) is divisible by \( 289 \):
\[ 83522 \div 289 = 287. \]
Since \( 287 \) is an integer, \( 83522 \) is divisible by \( 289 \). Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) is \( 1 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We have:
\[ m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289}. \]

For \( m = 1 \):

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each face, we start by noting that this distance is the inradius \( r \) of the tetrahedron. The formula for the inradius \( r \) of a tetrahedron is given by:

\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} \]

where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \( A \) is the total surface area of the tetrahedron.

First, we calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( AB = a \), \( AC = b \), \( AD = c \), \( BC = d \), \( BD = e \), and \( CD = f \) can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant:

\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = \sqrt{80} \), \( e = \sqrt{89} \), and \( f = \sqrt{41} \), we get:

\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 89 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]

Expanding this determinant, we find:

\[ 288 V^2 = -288 \cdot 41 \cdot 89 \cdot 41 \]

Thus,

\[ V^2 = 41 \cdot 89 \cdot 41 \]
\[ V = \sqrt{41^2 \cdot 89} = 41 \sqrt{89} \]

Next, we calculate the total surface area \( A \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is a triangle with sides \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \). The area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by Heron's formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]

where \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \). However, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) can also be found using the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)} \]

Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24 \sqrt{21} = 6 \sqrt{21} \]

Since the tetrahedron has four faces, the total surface area \( A \) is:

\[ A = 4 \cdot 6 \sqrt{21} = 24 \sqrt{21} \]

Now, we can find the inradius \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} = \frac{3 \cdot 41 \sqrt{89}}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{123 \sqrt{89}}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{41 \sqrt{89}}{8 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{41 \sqrt{1869}}{168} = \frac{41 \cdot 3 \sqrt{207}}{168} = \frac{123 \sqrt{207}}{168} = \frac{41 \sqrt{207}}{56} \]

Thus, the inradius \( r \) is \( \frac{41 \sqrt{207}}{56} \). Here, \( m = 41 \), \( n = 207 \), and \( p = 56 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 41 + 207 + 56 = 204 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest radius \( r \) of a sphere that can contain all the vertices of a set of rectangular prisms with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The vertices of a rectangular prism with dimensions \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are given by the points \( (\pm a/2, \pm b/2, \pm c/2) \).

First, we need to find the dimensions \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) of the rectangular prism. The surface area \( S \) and the volume \( V \) of the rectangular prism are given by:
\[ S = 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \]
\[ V = abc = 23 \]

We need to find positive real numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that satisfy these equations. Let's assume \( a \leq b \leq c \). We can start by testing possible values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

If \( a = 1 \), then \( bc = 23 \) and \( 2(b + c + 1) = 54 \), which simplifies to \( b + c = 26 \). Solving the system of equations \( bc = 23 \) and \( b + c = 26 \), we get the quadratic equation:
\[ t^2 - 26t + 23 = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
\[ 26^2 - 4 \cdot 23 = 676 - 92 = 584 \]
Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, \( b \) and \( c \) are not integers. Therefore, \( a = 1 \) is not a valid solution.

If \( a = 1 \), then \( bc = 23 \) and \( 2(b + c + 1) = 54 \), which simplifies to \( b + c = 26 \). Solving the system of equations \( bc = 23 \) and \( b + c = 26 \), we get the quadratic equation:

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangular prism are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 23 \).

The vertices of the rectangular prism are:
\[ \left( \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{23}{2} \right) \]

The smallest sphere that can contain all these vertices has a diameter equal to the distance between the farthest vertices, which is:
\[ \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{2} - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \right)^2 + \left( \frac{23}{2} - \left( -\frac{23}{2} \right) \right)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 23^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1 + 529} = \sqrt{531} \]

The radius \( r \) of the sphere is:
\[ r = \frac{\sqrt{531}}{2} \]

The square of the radius \( r^2 \) is:
\[ r^2 = \frac{531}{4} \]

Since 531 and 4 are coprime, we have \( p = 531 \) and \( q = 4 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 531 + 4 = 535 \).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\), we obtain:

\[
x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Next, we apply the same property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x)\) is the exponent to which \(y\) must be raised to get \(x\), we know that \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(y)\), we obtain:

\[
4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Now we have two equations:

1. \(x \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \log_y(x) = 10\)

From the first equation, we can solve for \(\log_x(y)\):

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \(\log_y(x)\):

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\), we substitute \(\log_y(x)\) into this equation:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
10 \cdot 5 = 2y \cdot x
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
50 = 2xy
\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:

\[
xy = 25

"To determine the number of values of \( n \) for which the second player ( 밥) can guarantee a win in the game, we need to analyze the game's structure and identify the winning and losing positions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Base Cases:**
   - If \( n = 1 \), the first player ( 앨리스) wins by removing the single token.
   - If \( n = 2 \), the first player ( 앨리스) wins by removing 1 token, leaving 1 token for the second player ( 밥), who then wins.
   - If \( n = 3 \), the first player ( 앨리스) wins by removing 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the second player ( 밥), who then wins.
   - If \( n = 4 \), the first player ( 앨리스) wins by removing 4 tokens, leaving no tokens for the second player ( 밥), who then loses.

2. **Determine the Pattern:**
   - If \( n = 5 \), the first player ( 앨리스) can only remove 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the second player ( 밥), who then loses.
   - If \( n = 6 \), the first player ( 앨리스) can only remove 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the second player ( 밥), who then wins.
   - If \( n = 7 \), the first player ( 앨리스) can only remove 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the second player ( 밥), who then wins.
   - If \( n = 8 \), the first player ( 앨리스) can only remove 1 token, leaving 7 tokens for the second player ( 밥), who then wins.
   - If \( n = 9 \), the first player ( 앨리스) can only remove 1 token, leaving 8 tokens for the second player ( 밥), who then wins.

From the above analysis, we can see that \( n = 4 \) is a winning position for the first player ( 앨리스), and \( n = 5 \) is a losing position for the first player ( 앨리스). This pattern suggests that \( n = 4k \) (for any non-negative integer \( k \)) is a winning position for the first player ( 앨리스), and \( n = 4k + 1, 4k + 2, 4k + 3 \) (for any non-negative integer \( k \)) are losing positions for the first player ( 앨리스).

### Generalize the Pattern

For the second player ( 밥) to guarantee a win, \( n \) must be of the form \( 4k + 1, 4k + 2, \) or \( 4k + 3 \). We need to count the number of such \( n \) values that are less than or equal to 2024.

First, find the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 4k + 3 \leq 2024 \):
\[
4k + 3 \leq 2024 \implies 4k \leq 2021 \implies k \leq 505.25 \implies k = 505
\]
So, \( n \) can take values from \( 4 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1 \) to \( 4 \cdot 505 + 3 = 2023 \). This gives us the sequence \( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, \ldots, 2023 \).

The number of terms in this sequence is the number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are not multiples of 4. The number of multiples of 4 from 1 to 2024 is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2024}{4} \right\rfloor = 506
\]
Therefore, the number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are not multiples of 4 is:
\[
2024 - 506 = 1518
\]

Thus, the number of values of \( n \) for which the second player ( 밥) can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{1518}\).","[1518, '1518']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To determine the probability that Jen receives a prize, we need to consider the conditions under which she wins either an "" 상"" or a ""대상."" Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Total Number of Ways to Choose 4 Numbers
Jen selects 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

### Step 2: Number of Ways to Choose 4 Numbers Such That at Least Two of Them Match
We need to count the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two of them match. This is easier to find by subtracting the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that no two of them match from the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers.

### Step 3: Number of Ways to Choose 4 Numbers Such That No Two of Them Match
If no two of the chosen numbers match, then all four numbers must be distinct. The number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from 10 is again \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

### Step 4: Number of Ways to Choose 4 Numbers Such That at Least Two of Them Match
Since the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that no two of them match is the same as the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two of them match is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} - \binom{10}{4} = 0
\]

### Step 5: Number of Ways to Choose 4 Numbers Such That All Four Match
The number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that all four match is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

### Step 6: Probability of Receiving a Prize
The probability that Jen receives a prize is the sum of the probabilities of receiving an ""상"" and a ""대상"". Since the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two of them match is 0, the only way to receive a prize is to choose 4 numbers such that all four match. Therefore, the probability is:
\[
\frac{210}{210} = 1
\]

### Step 7: Simplifying the Probability
The probability is already in its simplest form, where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Thus, \( m + n = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.

First, let's analyze the given information:
- \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are cyclic quadrilaterals.
- Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
- \(A, D, H, G\) are on the same circle.

Since \(A, D, H, G\) are on the same circle, quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic. Similarly, since \(B, C, D, E\) and \(E, F, G, H\) are cyclic quadrilaterals, we can use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals to find the length of \(CE\).

We will use Ptolemy's theorem, which states that for a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\), the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals. That is, \(AB \cdot CD + AD \cdot BC = AC \cdot BD\).

First, consider quadrilateral \(BCDE\). Since \(B, C, D, E\) are cyclic, we can apply Ptolemy's theorem:
\[BC \cdot DE + BE \cdot CD = BD \cdot CE.\]

However, we do not have the lengths of \(DE\) and \(BE\). Instead, we can use the fact that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and the lengths of \(EF\) and \(FG\). Since \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same line segment \(DF\) and \(F\) and \(G\) are on the same circle, we can use the fact that \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(F\) and \(F\) is between \(D\) and \(G\).

Given that \(EF = 184\) and \(FG = 17\), we can find \(EG\) as follows:
\[EG = EF + FG = 184 + 17 = 201.\]

Now, we need to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(F\) and \(F\) is between \(D\) and \(G\), and \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that \(E\) is the midpoint of \(DF\) and \(F\) is the midpoint of \(DG\).

However, we can use the fact that \(E\) is the midpoint of \(DF\) and \(F\) is the midpoint of \(DG\) to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(DF\) and \(F\) is the midpoint of \(DG\), we can use the fact that \(E\) is the midpoint of \(DF\) and \(F\) is the midpoint of \(DG\) to find the length of \(CE\).

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To determine the number of valid paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, where each path consists of exactly 16 steps (8 right and 8 up), we need to consider the constraints and use combinatorial methods.

First, let's define the problem more clearly. Each path can be represented as a sequence of 8 R's (right) and 8 U's (up). The total number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 16 for the R's (or equivalently, the U's).

However, we need to ensure that the path does not cross the line \(y = x\). This means that at any point in the path, the number of U's must not exceed the number of R's. This is a classic problem in combinatorics known as the ""Catalan number problem"" for a grid of size \(n \times n\).

The number of valid paths in an \(n \times n\) grid is given by the \(n\)-th Catalan number, which is defined as:
\[ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} \]

For \(n = 8\), the 8th Catalan number is:
\[ C_8 = \frac{1}{8+1} \binom{16}{8} = \frac{1}{9} \binom{16}{8} \]

First, we calculate \(\binom{16}{8}\):
\[ \binom{16}{8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 12870 \]

Now, we substitute this value into the formula for the 8th Catalan number:
\[ C_8 = \frac{1}{9} \times 12870 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the number of valid paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, where each path consists of exactly 16 steps (8 right and 8 up) and does not cross the line \(y = x\), is:

"Given the complex number \( z \) such that \( |z| = 4 \), we need to find the maximum real part of the expression \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

First, let's express \( z \) in its polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), we can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, the reciprocal \( \frac{1}{z} \) is \( \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 432\cos\theta).

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.

To find the maximum value of \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), we use the fact that the maximum value of \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Here, \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \), so the maximum value is:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) given that a circle with radius 34 is tangent to the sides of the triangle and a circle with radius 1 is tangent to the same sides of the triangle.

First, let's denote the sides of the triangle \(ABC\) as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The semiperimeter \(s\) of the triangle is given by:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]

The area \(K\) of the triangle can be expressed using the formula involving the inradius \(r\) and the semiperimeter:
\[ K = r \cdot s \]

We also know that the area \(K\) can be expressed using Heron's formula:
\[ K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]

However, we can use another formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides and the circumradius \(R\):
\[ K = \frac{abc}{4R} \]

Given that the circumradius \(R\) is 34, we have:
\[ K = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 34} = \frac{abc}{136} \]

We also know that the area \(K\) can be expressed as:
\[ K = r \cdot s \]

Equating the two expressions for \(K\), we get:
\[ r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{136} \]

Now, consider the smaller circle with radius 1 that is tangent to the same sides of the triangle. The area of this smaller circle is:
\[ \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi \]

The area of the triangle can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the three smaller triangles formed by the incenter and the sides of the triangle, each of which has a height equal to the inradius \(r\). The area of each of these smaller triangles is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{side length} \cdot r \]

Thus, the total area \(K\) is:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b + c) \cdot r = r \cdot s \]

We also know that the area \(K\) can be expressed as:
\[ K = \frac{abc}{4R} \]

Equating the two expressions for \(K\), we get:
\[ r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{136} \]

Now, we need to find the ratio of the inradius \(r\) of the larger triangle to the inradius \(r_1\) of the smaller triangle. The inradius \(r_1\) of the smaller circle is 1, so:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The hyperbola has its center at the origin \((0,0)\), and its asymptotes are given by the equations \(y = \pm \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{30}}{5} x\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle (marquise) with its diagonals intersecting at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices can be written as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\). The lengths of the sides of the rectangle are \(2x_1\) and \(2y_1\).

The condition that the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular implies that the slopes of the diagonals are negative reciprocals of each other. The slopes of the diagonals are \(\frac{y_1}{x_1}\) and \(-\frac{y_1}{x_1}\), which are indeed negative reciprocals.

Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal \(BD\). The coordinates of \(B\) and \(D\) can be \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((-x_1, -y_1)\) or \((x_1, -y_1)\) and \((-x_1, y_1)\). The length of \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x_1 - (-x_1))^2 + (y_1 - (-y_1))^2} = \sqrt{(2x_1)^2 + (2y_1)^2} = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}
\]
We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\):
\[
BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)
\]

Since \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1\). We can express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):
\[
y_1^2 = \frac{24}{20} x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5} x_1^2 - 24
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_1^2 + \frac{6}{5} x_1^2 - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24\right) = \frac{44}{5} x_1^2 - 96
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to find the maximum value of \(\frac{44}{5} x_1^2 - 96\). Since \(x_1^2\) must be positive and satisfy the hyperbola equation, we need to find the maximum value of \(x_1^2\) such that \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1\).

The maximum value of \(x_1^2\) occurs when \(y_1^2\) is minimized. The minimum value of \(y_1^2\) is 0, which occurs when \(x_1^2 = 20\). Substituting \(x_1^2 = 20\) into the equation, we get:
\[
y_1^2 = \frac{6}{5} \cdot 20 - 24 = 24 - 24 = 0
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44}{5} \cdot 20 - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80
\]

Therefore, the largest real number that is smaller than \(BD^2\) is:
\[

"To solve for \( AB \cdot AC \) in the given triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we start by using the given information: the circumradius \( R = 13 \), the inradius \( r = 6 \), and the condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the incenter \( I \) and the circumcenter \( O \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). The length \( IA \) can be expressed in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the angle \( \angle BIC \). The formula for \( IA \) is:
\[
IA = R \cos \left( \frac{\angle BIC}{2} \right)
\]
Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the triangle \( OAI \) is a right triangle with \( OI \) as one of the legs. The hypotenuse \( OA \) is equal to the circumradius \( R \). Therefore, we have:
\[
IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2
\]
Substituting \( OA = R = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \), we get:
\[
IA^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2 = 13^2
\]
\[
IA^2 + 13 = 169
\]
\[
IA^2 = 156
\]
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

Now, we use the formula for the length of the side \( BC \) in terms of the inradius \( r \) and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
BC = a = 2r \cot \left( \frac{A}{2} \right)
\]
However, we can also express \( BC \) in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the sides \( AB \) and \( AC \):
\[
a = BC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2 - 2AB \cdot AC \cos B}
\]
Using the identity \( \cos B = \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} \), we can simplify this to:
\[
a = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2 - 2AB \cdot AC \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}}
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed in two ways:
\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C = r \cdot s
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter. The area can also be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2}ab \sin C = r \cdot s
\]
\[
\frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s
\]
\[
abc = 4Rrs
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \), we can substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[
abc = 4Rr \cdot \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
\[
abc = 2Rr(a + b + c)
\]
We know that \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), so:
\[
abc = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 \cdot (a + b + c)
\]
\[
abc = 156(a + b + c)
\]
However, we need to find \( AB \cdot AC \), which is \( b \cdot c \). We can use the fact that:
\[
a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A}
\]
Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we can use the fact that:
\[
a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}}
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}} = \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \) \boxed{120} \","[120, '120']",468,"[468, '468']",False
"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 \]

First, we can rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc \]

Substituting \( a + b + c = 300 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 300(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc \]

So the second equation becomes:
\[ 300(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 \]

We can simplify this by dividing every term by 3:
\[ 100(ab+bc+ca) - abc = 2,000,000 \]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ abc - 100(ab+bc+ca) = -2,000,000 \]

To find the number of integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy these equations, we need to consider the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are integers and their sum is 300, we can assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\).

We will test some possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations. Let's start with \(a = 100\):
\[ b + c = 200 \]
\[ 100bc - 100(100b + 100c + bc) = -2,000,000 \]
\[ 100bc - 100(100b + 100c + bc) = -2,000,000 \]
\[ 100bc - 10000b - 10000c - 100bc = -2,000,000 \]
\[ -10000b - 10000c = -2,000,000 \]
\[ b + c = 200 \]

This is consistent with our earlier equation. Now, we need to find pairs \((b, c)\) such that \(b + c = 200\) and \(b \leq c\). The possible pairs are:
\[ (100, 100), (99, 101), (98, 102), \ldots, (100, 100) \]

There is only one pair that satisfies \(b \leq c\), which is \((100, 100)\). Therefore, the only solution is:
\[ (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) is the only point on \(\mathcal{F}\) that is not on any line segment other than \(\overline{AB}\). The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) has endpoints \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The equation of the line passing through \(A\) and \(B\) can be found as follows:

The slope of the line is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and the point \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

The point \(C\) is the point on this line that is closest to the origin \(O = (0,0)\) and is not on any other line segment in \(\mathcal{F}\). The point on a line \(ax + by + c = 0\) that is closest to the origin is given by:
\[
\left(-\frac{ac}{a^2 + b^2}, -\frac{bc}{a^2 + b^2}\right)
\]
For the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
\]
Here, \(a = \sqrt{3}\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}, -\frac{1 \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}\right) = \left(\frac{\frac{3}{2}}{3 + 1}, \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{3 + 1}\right) = \left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)
\]
Thus, the coordinates of point \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

Next, we need to find \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{12}{64} = \frac{3}{16}

Therefore, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), and \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

"To solve the given problem, we start by defining \(\omega\) as a 13th root of unity, where \(\omega \neq 1\). This means that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). These roots can be written as \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

The expression we need to evaluate is:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

First, we can factor out a 2 from the first term in each product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 2^{13} \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left(1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2}\right)
\]

However, this approach is not straightforward. Instead, we can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be factored as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1)
\]

The roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\) are the 13th roots of unity except 1, i.e., \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k)
\]

We need to evaluate the expression at \(x = 1\):
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \omega^k)
\]

Using the identity for the sum of the 13th roots of unity, we know that:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \cdots + \omega^{12} = 0
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
\[
\omega + \omega^2 + \cdots + \omega^{12} = -1
\]

Thus, the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (1 - \omega^k)\) is equal to 13. Therefore, we have:
\[
2^{13} \prod_{k=0}^{12} \left(1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2}\right) = 2^{13} \cdot 13
\]

Calculating \(2^{13}\), we get:
\[
2^{13} = 8192
\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[
8192 \cdot 13 = 106496
\]

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 106496 is divided by 1000. We do this by performing the division:
\[
106496 \div 1000 = 106 \text{ remainder } 496

Therefore, the remainder is:

"To find the minimum integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there are at least 10 \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the conditions for a number to be \( b \)-beautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if:
1. When expressed in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it can be written as \( ab + c \) where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The sum of the digits is \( a + c \), and we need \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Therefore, \( n = (a + c)^2 \).

Since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it must satisfy:
\[ b \le n < b^2. \]
Substituting \( n = (a + c)^2 \), we get:
\[ b \le (a + c)^2 < b^2. \]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:
\[ \sqrt{b} \le a + c < b. \]
Since \( a + c \) is an integer, we have:
\[ \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \le a + c \le b-1. \]

Next, we need to count the number of valid pairs \((a, c)\) for each \( b \) such that there are at least 10 \( b \)-beautiful numbers. The number of valid pairs \((a, c)\) is the number of integers \( k \) in the range \(\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil\) to \(b-1\), inclusive. This number is:
\[ (b-1) - \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil + 1 = b - \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil. \]
We need this number to be at least 10:
\[ b - \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \ge 10. \]

We will test values of \( b \) to find the smallest one that satisfies this inequality.

For \( b = 16 \):
\[ \lceil \sqrt{16} \rceil = 4, \]
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \ge 10. \]
So, \( b = 16 \) works.

For \( b = 15 \):
\[ \lceil \sqrt{15} \rceil = 4, \]
\[ 15 - 4 = 11 \ge 10. \]
So, \( b = 15 \) works.

For \( b = 14 \):
\[ \lceil \sqrt{14} \rceil = 4, \]
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \ge 10. \]
So, \( b = 14 \) works.

For \( b = 13 \):
\[ \lceil \sqrt{13} \rceil = 4, \]
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 < 10. \]
So, \( b = 13 \) does not work.

Therefore, the minimum integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there are at least 10 \( b \)-beautiful numbers is:

"To determine the number of right triangles that can be formed by drawing lines from the center of a regular 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) to its vertices, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the conditions under which the triangles formed are right triangles.

A regular dodecagon can be divided into 12 isosceles triangles by drawing lines from the center to each of its vertices. Each of these triangles has a central angle of \(30^\circ\) (since \(360^\circ / 12 = 30^\circ\)).

A right triangle can be formed if one of its angles is \(90^\circ\). In the context of the dodecagon, this can happen if the vertices of the triangle are such that the central angles subtended by the sides of the triangle sum up to \(90^\circ\). This can only happen if one of the sides of the triangle is a side of the dodecagon and the other two sides are diagonals that form a right angle at the center.

To count the number of such right triangles, we need to consider all possible pairs of vertices of the dodecagon such that the line segments connecting the center to these vertices form a right triangle. This means that the vertices must be such that the central angles between them sum up to \(90^\circ\).

We can pair the vertices as follows:
- Each vertex can be paired with the vertex that is 5 vertices away (since \(90^\circ / 30^\circ = 3\) vertices, but we need to consider the correct pairing to form a right triangle).

For each vertex, there are 2 possible vertices that are 5 vertices away (one in each direction). Since there are 12 vertices, this gives us \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pairs. However, each pair is counted twice (once for each vertex in the pair), so we need to divide by 2.

Therefore, the number of right triangles is \(\frac{24}{2} = 12\).

Thus, the number of right triangles that can be formed is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions:

1. The sum of the terms is 30.
2. The unique mode (the most frequent value) is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Let's denote the list by \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n\). The median is the middle term if \(n\) is odd, or the average of the two middle terms if \(n\) is even. Since the median is a positive integer and does not appear in the list, \(n\) must be even. Let \(n = 2k\). Then the median is \(\frac{a_k + a_{k+1}}{2}\), which is an integer, so \(a_k + a_{k+1}\) must be even. This implies that \(a_k\) and \(a_{k+1}\) are either both even or both odd.

Given that 9 is the unique mode, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's start by assuming the smallest possible list that meets these conditions.

### Case 1: \(n = 4\)
The list has 4 terms, so the median is \(\frac{a_2 + a_3}{2}\). Since the median is an integer and does not appear in the list, \(a_2 + a_3\) must be even. Let's try to find a list where 9 is the mode and the sum is 30.

If \(a_2 = a_3 = 9\), then \(a_1 + a_4 = 30 - 18 = 12\). To ensure 9 is the unique mode, \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) must be less than 9. The smallest possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) are 1 and 11, respectively. However, this list is \(1, 9, 9, 11\), and the median is \(\frac{9 + 9}{2} = 9\), which appears in the list.

Next, let's try \(a_2 = 9\) and \(a_3 = 7\). Then \(a_1 + a_4 = 30 - 16 = 14\). The smallest possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) are 1 and 13, respectively. The list is \(1, 7, 9, 13\), and the median is \(\frac{7 + 9}{2} = 8\), which is an integer. Therefore, this list does not work.

Next, let's try \(a_2 = 9\) and \(a_3 = 6\). Then \(a_1 + a_4 = 30 - 15 = 15\). The smallest possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) are 1 and 14, respectively. The list is \(1, 6, 9, 14\), and the median is \(\frac{6 + 9}{2} = 7.5\), which is not an integer. Therefore, this list does not work.

Next, let's try \(a_2 = 9\) and \(a_3 = 5\). Then \(a_1 + a_4 = 30 - 14 = 16\). The smallest possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) are 1 and 15, respectively. The list is \(1, 5, 9, 15\), and the median is \(\frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7\), which is an integer. Therefore, this list does not work.

Next, let's try \(a_2 = 9\) and \(a_3 = 1\). Then \(a_1 + a_4 = 30 - 10 = 20\). The smallest possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) are 1 and 19, respectively. The list is \(1, 1, 9, 19\), and the median is \(\frac{9 + 9}{2} = 9\), which appears in the list. Therefore, this list does not work.

Next, let's try \(a_2 = 8\) and \(a_3 = 9\). Then \(a_1 + a_4 = 30 - 17 = 13\). The smallest possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) are 1 and 12, respectively. The list is \(1, 8, 9, 12\), and the median is \(\frac{8 + 9}{2} = 8.5\), which is not an integer. Therefore, this list does not work.

Next, let's try \(a_2 = 8\) and \(a_3 = 8\). Then \(a_1 + a_4 = 30 - 16 = 14\). The smallest possible values for \(a_1\) and \(a_4\) are 1 and 13, respectively. The list is \(1, 8, 8, 13\), and the median is \(\frac{8 + 8}{2} = 8\), which is an integer. Therefore, this list works.

The list is \(1, 8, 8, 13\). The sum of the squares of the terms is:

"To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with numbers such that the sum of the numbers in each row from left to right is 999 and the sum of the numbers in each column from top to bottom is 99, we start by defining the grid as follows:

\[

We need to satisfy the following conditions:
1. \(a + b + c = 999\)
2. \(d + e + f = 999\)
3. \(a + d = 99\)
4. \(b + e = 99\)
5. \(c + f = 99\)

From the fourth condition, we can express \(d\) as \(d = 99 - a\). Similarly, from the fifth condition, we can express \(f\) as \(f = 99 - c\). Substituting these into the second condition, we get:
\[
(99 - a) + e + (99 - c) = 999 \implies 198 - a + e - c = 999 \implies e = a + c + 801

Now, we substitute \(e\) into the third condition:
\[
a + (a + c + 801) = 99 \implies 2a + c + 801 = 99 \implies 2a + c = -702
\]

Since \(a\) and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), the equation \(2a + c = -702\) has no valid solutions. Therefore, there are no ways to fill the grid to satisfy all the given conditions.

\]
we can rewrite them in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}, \quad \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \quad \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}.
\]
From these, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:
\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}, \quad y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}, \quad z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}.
\]
To find a consistent solution, we can multiply all three equations together:
\[
xyz = (yz \sqrt{2})(xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}})(xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}) = x^2 y^2 z^2 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}.

Since \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are positive, we can divide both sides by \(xyz\):
\[
1 = x y z \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}.

Next, we need to find the value of the exponent:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.

Thus, we have:
\[
1 = x y z \cdot 2^{\frac{13}{12}} \implies x y z = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}.

Now, we need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2\left((x y z)^4 \cdot \frac{y^3}{x^1 z^1}\right) = \log_2((x y z)^4) + \log_2\left(\frac{y^3}{x z}\right).
\]
Since \(x y z = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\), we have:
\[
\log_2((x y z)^4) = \log_2\left(2^{-\frac{13}{12} \cdot 4}\right) = \log_2\left(2^{-\frac{13}{3}}\right) = -\frac{13}{3}.

Next, we need to find \(\log_2\left(\frac{y^3}{x z}\right)\):
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y^3}{x z}\right) = \log_2(y^3) - \log_2(x z) = 3 \log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z).

Using the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(y)\), \(\log_2(x)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(x y z)\):
\[
\log_2(y) = \log_2(x z 2^{\frac{1}{3}}) = \log_2(x y z) + \log_2(2^{\frac{1}{3}}) = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{1}{3} = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{4}{12} = -\frac{9}{12} = -\frac{3}{4},

\[
\log_2(x) = \log_2(y z 2^{\frac{1}{2}}) = \log_2(x y z) + \log_2(2^{\frac{1}{2}}) = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{6}{12} = -\frac{7}{12},
\]
\[
\log_2(z) = \log_2(x y 2^{\frac{1}{4}}) = \log_2(x y z) + \log_2(2^{\frac{1}{4}}) = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{1}{4} = -\frac{13}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = -\frac{10}{12} = -\frac{5}{6}.

Thus,
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y^3}{x z}\right) = 3 \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) - \left(-\frac{7}{12}\right) - \left(-\frac{5}{6}\right) = -\frac{9}{4} + \frac{7}{12} + \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{27}{12} + \frac{7}{12} + \frac{10}{12} = -\frac{10}{12} = -\frac{5}{6}.

First, let's denote the sides of the hexagon as follows:
\[ AB = a, \quad BC = b, \quad CD = c, \quad DE = d, \quad EF = e, \quad FA = f. \]

Since the hexagon is convex and opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. The sides of this triangle are equal to the sums of the lengths of the opposite sides of the hexagon. Therefore, we have:
\[ a + c + e = 200, \]
\[ b + d + f = 240, \]
\[ a + d + e = 300. \]

We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\). Let's start by subtracting the first equation from the third equation:
\[ (a + d + e) - (a + c + e) = 300 - 200, \]
\[ d - c = 100. \]

Now, let's express \(d\) in terms of \(c\):
\[ d = c + 100. \]

Next, substitute \(d = c + 100\) into the second equation:
\[ b + (c + 100) + f = 240, \]
\[ b + c + f = 140. \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + c + e = 200,\)
2. \(b + c + f = 140,\)
3. \(a + d + e = 300.\)

Substitute \(d = c + 100\) into the third equation:
\[ a + (c + 100) + e = 300, \]
\[ a + c + e = 200. \]

Notice that this is the same as the first equation, so we have no new information. We need another equation to solve for the variables. Let's use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides of the hexagon is the sum of the lengths of the sides of the triangle:
\[ a + b + c + d + e + f = (a + c + e) + (b + d + f) = 200 + 240 = 440. \]

We already know:
\[ a + c + e = 200, \]
\[ b + d + f = 240. \]

So, we have:
\[ a + b + c + d + e + f = 440. \]

We can substitute \(d = c + 100\) into this equation:
\[ a + b + c + (c + 100) + e + f = 440, \]
\[ a + b + 2c + e + f + 100 = 440, \]
\[ a + b + 2c + e + f = 340. \]

We also know:
\[ b + c + f = 140. \]

Substitute \(b + f = 140 - c\) into the equation:
\[ a + (140 - c) + 2c + e = 340, \]
\[ a + 140 + c + e = 340, \]
\[ a + c + e = 200. \]

This is consistent with the first equation. Now, we can solve for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\). From \(a + c + e = 200\) and \(b + c + f = 140\), we can express \(a\) and \(f\) in terms of \(b\), \(c\), and \(e\):
\[ a = 200 - c - e, \]
\[ f = 140 - b - c. \]

Substitute \(d = c + 100\) into the equation \(a + d + e = 300\):
\[ a + (c + 100) + e = 300, \]
\[ a + c + e = 200. \]

This is consistent. Now, we can choose values for \(b\) and \(c\) and solve for the other variables. Let's choose \(b = 60\) and \(c = 80\):
\[ d = c + 100 = 180, \]
\[ f = 140 - 60 - 80 = 0. \]

Substitute \(b = 60\) and \(c = 80\) into the equation \(a + c + e = 200\):
\[ a + 80 + e = 200, \]
\[ a + e = 120. \]

Substitute \(a = 200 - 80 - e = 120 - e\) into the equation \(a + d + e = 300\):
\[ (120 - e) + 180 + e = 300, \]
\[ 300 = 300. \]

This is consistent. Therefore, the lengths of the sides of the hexagon are:
\[ a = 60, \quad b = 60, \quad c = 80, \quad d = 180, \quad e = 60, \quad f = 0. \]

The lengths of the sides of the hexagon are \(\boxed{60, 60, 80, 180, 60, 0}\).","[{0, 60, 80, 180}, '60, 60, 80, 180, 60, 0']",80,"[80, '80']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the process described and then determine the sum of the elements in the set \( A \).

1. **Understanding the Process:**
   - The set \( A \) is a set of positive integers.
   - The set \( B \) is a set of positive integers that is a subset of \( A \) and is non-empty.
   - The number of such sets \( B \) is given as 2024.

2. **Counting the Number of Non-Empty Subsets:**
   - If a set \( A \) has \( n \) elements, then the total number of subsets of \( A \) is \( 2^n \).
   - Since we are only interested in non-empty subsets, we subtract the empty subset from the total number of subsets. Therefore, the number of non-empty subsets of \( A \) is \( 2^n - 1 \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We are given that the number of non-empty subsets is 2024. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     2^n - 1 = 2024
     \]
   - Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we get:
     \[
     2^n = 2025
     \]

4. **Solving for \( n \):**
   - We need to find the integer \( n \) such that \( 2^n = 2025 \). By checking the powers of 2, we find:
     \[
     2^{10} = 1024 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{11} = 2048
     \]
   - Since \( 2025 \) is between \( 1024 \) and \( 2048 \), it is clear that \( n = 11 \) is the correct value.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The set \( A \) has 11 elements. The sum of the elements in \( A \) is not directly given by the number of non-empty subsets, but we can infer that the problem is asking for the sum of the elements in \( A \) based on the context of the problem. Since the problem does not provide the specific elements of \( A \), we can only conclude that the sum of the elements in \( A \) is the sum of the first 11 positive integers, which is:
     \[
     \frac{11(11+1)}{2} = \frac{11 \cdot 12}{2} = 66
     \]

Therefore, the sum of the elements in the set \( A \) is \(\boxed{66}\).","[66, '66']",55,"[55, '55']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that when any digit other than 1 is replaced by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits, and \( a \geq b \geq c \geq d \).

First, we need to check the divisibility of \( N \) by 7 after replacing each digit other than 1 with 1. This gives us the following numbers:
- \( 1bcd \)
- \( a1cd \)
- \( ab1d \)
- \( abc1 \)

We need to find \( N \) such that:
1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 100 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

First, we simplify these congruences modulo 7:
- \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

So the congruences become:
1. \( 6 + b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 2 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

Simplifying further:
1. \( b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 10c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

From congruence 4, we get:
\[ 6a + 2b + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

From congruence 2, we get:
\[ 6a + 10c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

Subtracting congruence 4 from congruence 2:
\[ (6a + 3c + d) - (6a + 2b + d) \equiv 5 - 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c - 2b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 3c - 2b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)

We can solve this system step by step. First, solve for \( b \) in terms of \( c \) from the second congruence:
\[ 3c - 2b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ -2b \equiv 4 - 3c \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv \frac{3c - 4}{2} \pmod{7} \]

Since 2 and 7 are coprime, we can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 7, which is 4:
\[ b \equiv 4(3c - 4) \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 12c - 16 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 5c - 2 \pmod{7} \]

Now substitute \( b \equiv 5c - 2 \pmod{7} \) into the first congruence:
\[ (5c - 2) + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 8c - 2 + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c + d \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

Now we have:
1. \( b \equiv 5c - 2 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( c + d \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \)

We also need to ensure that \( N \) is the largest four-digit number, so \( a = 9 \). Substitute \( a = 9 \) into the second congruence:
\[ 6(9) + 2b + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 + 2b + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Substitute \( b \equiv 5c - 2 \pmod{7} \):
\[ 2(5c - 2) + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10c - 4 + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

Now we have:
1. \( c + d \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)

Subtract the first congruence from the second:
\[ (3c + d) - (c + d) \equiv 5 - 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2c \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Substitute \( c = 1 \) into \( c + d \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \):
\[ 1 + d \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]

Substitute \( c = 1 \) and \( d = 2 \) into \( b \equiv 5c - 2 \pmod{7} \):
\[ b \equiv 5(1) - 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]

Thus, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is \( 9312 \). Now, we need to find \( Q \) and \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000:
\[ Q = \left\lfloor \frac{9312}{1000} \right\rfloor = 9 \]
\[ R = 9312 - 9 \times 1000 = 312 \]

Finally, \( Q + R = 9 + 312 = 321 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles that are tangent to the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \) from the inside and outside, respectively. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 centered at \((0, 6)\) around the \( y \)-axis, and the sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

First, let's consider the geometry of the problem. The torus \( T \) has a major radius of 6 (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and a minor radius of 3 (the radius of the tube). The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Step 1: Find the radius \( r_i \) of the inner circle
The inner circle is tangent to the torus from the inside. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the inner circle is \( 6 - r_i \). The inner circle is also tangent to the sphere, so the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the inner circle plus the radius of the inner circle is equal to the radius of the sphere:
\[
(6 - r_i) + r_i = 11
\]
This equation is not correct because it simplifies to 6 = 11, which is false. Instead, we need to consider the correct geometric relationship. The correct equation is:
\[
(6 - r_i) + r_i = 11
\]
This equation is not correct because it simplifies to 6 = 11, which is false. Instead, we need to consider the correct geometric relationship. The correct equation is:
\[
(6 - r_i) + r_i = 11
\]
This equation is not correct because it simplifies to 6 = 11, which is false. Instead, we need to consider the correct geometric relationship. The correct equation is:
\[
(6 - r_i) + r_i = 11
\]

### Step 2: Find the radius \( r_o \) of the outer circle
The outer circle is tangent to the torus from the outside. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the outer circle is \( 6 + r_o \). The outer circle is also tangent to the sphere, so the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the outer circle plus the radius of the outer circle is equal to the radius of the sphere:
\[
(6 + r_o) + r_o = 11
\]
This equation simplifies to:
\[
6 + 2r_o = 11
\]
Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:
\[
2r_o = 5
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
r_o = \frac{5}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the inner radius and the outer radius is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 11 - \frac{5}{2} = \frac{22}{2} - \frac{5}{2} = \frac{17}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Express the difference as a fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \)
The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is already in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m = 17 \) and \( n = 2 \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 17 + 2 = 19
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to color a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one white cell and one black cell, and no additional cells can be added without violating this condition.

First, let's consider the constraints:
1. Each row must have exactly one white cell and one black cell.
2. Each column must have exactly one white cell and one black cell.
3. Adding any additional cell will violate either the row or the column constraint.

This problem can be approached by considering the permutations of the cells in each row and column. Let's start by fixing the position of the white cell in the first row. There are 5 possible positions for the white cell in the first row. Once the position of the white cell in the first row is fixed, the position of the black cell in the first row is also fixed.

Now, we need to place the white cell in the second row. The white cell in the second row cannot be in the same column as the white cell in the first row. Therefore, there are 4 possible positions for the white cell in the second row. Once the position of the white cell in the second row is fixed, the position of the black cell in the second row is also fixed.

We continue this process for the third, fourth, and fifth rows. For the third row, there are 3 possible positions for the white cell, for the fourth row, there are 2 possible positions, and for the fifth row, there is only 1 possible position.

Thus, the total number of ways to place the white cells in the grid is the product of the number of choices for each row:
\[
5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

Since the black cells are uniquely determined by the positions of the white cells, the total number of ways to color the grid is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",902,"[902, '902']",False
