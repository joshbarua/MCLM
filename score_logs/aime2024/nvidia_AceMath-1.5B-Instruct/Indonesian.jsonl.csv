"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Aya spends per day, which includes the time spent walking and the time spent at the kiosk. Let's denote the time spent walking as \( w \) hours and the time spent at the kiosk as \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The total time per day is then \( w + \frac{t}{60} \) hours.

First, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour, the time spent walking is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours. The total time per day is given as 4 hours, so we have:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]

Next, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the time spent walking is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours. The total time per day is given as 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is \( 2.4 \) hours. So, we have:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \(\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4\)
2. \(\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4\)

We can eliminate \(\frac{t}{60}\) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]

To solve for \( s \), we find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side:
\[
\frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s(s+2)
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s
\]
\[
1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0
\]

We can simplify this quadratic equation by dividing every term by 1.6:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]

This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]

Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) kilometers per hour. Now, we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4
\]
\[
t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the total time per day when Aya walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) kilometers per hour:
\[
\frac{9}{3} + \frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \text{ hours}
\]

Converting 3.4 hours to minutes:
\[
3.4 \times 60 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Aya spends per day, including the time spent at the kiosk, is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.","[204, '204']",204,"[204, '204']",True
"To solve for \(AP\) in the given problem, we will use properties of circles and tangents. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(ABC\) is a triangle inscribed in a circle \(\omega\).
   - The tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\) meet at \(D\).
   - \(\overline{AD}\) intersects \(\omega\) again at \(P\).
   - \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\).

2. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   The Power of a Point Theorem states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the power of the point is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of any secant line passing through \(D\) and the square of the length of the tangent segment from \(D\) to the circle. Here, \(D\) is the point where the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) meet, so \(DB^2 = DC^2 = DP \cdot DA\).

3. **Calculate the semiperimeter \(s\) of \(\triangle ABC\):**
   \[
   s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
   \]

4. **Calculate the area \(K\) of \(\triangle ABC\) using Heron's formula:**
   \[
   K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
   \]

5. **Calculate the circumradius \(R\) of \(\triangle ABC\):**
   The formula for the circumradius \(R\) is given by:
   \[
   R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
   \]

6. **Use the formula for the length of the tangent segment \(DB\):**
   The length of the tangent segment from a point outside a circle to the point of tangency is given by:
   \[
   DB = \sqrt{AD \cdot DC} = \sqrt{AD \cdot (2R - AD)}
   \]
   However, we can use the fact that \(DB^2 = DP \cdot DA\) and \(DB^2 = s(s-a) = 12 \cdot 7 = 84\). Therefore:
   \[
   DP \cdot DA = 84
   \]

7. **Use the fact that \(P\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\):**
   Since \(P\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\), \(P\) is the point where the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) intersects the circumcircle. This implies that \(AP\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\).

8. **Use the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{BP}{PC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   Let \(BP = x\) and \(PC = 2x\). Then:
   \[
   BC = BP + PC = x + 2x = 3x = 9 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \(BP = 3\) and \(PC = 6\).

9. **Use the formula for the length of the angle bisector \(AP\):**
   The length of the angle bisector \(AP\) is given by:
   \[
   AP = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5 + 10)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{9}{25}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \cdot \frac{16}{25}} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
   \]

10. **Express \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\):**
    Since \(4\sqrt{2} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1}\), we have \(m = 4\sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 1\). However, we need to express \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers. Therefore, we need to rationalize the expression:
    \[
    AP = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{1} =","[{m, n}, 'm and n']",113,"[113, '113']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon, with each vertex independently colored either red or blue with equal probability, can be rotated so that all red vertices are in their original positions. This means that the red vertices must form a block of consecutive vertices that can be rotated to any position.

First, let's consider the total number of possible colorings of the octagon. Since each of the 8 vertices can be either red or blue, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of colorings where the red vertices form a block that can be rotated to any position. This means that the block of red vertices must be of length 1, 2, 4, or 8 (since these are the divisors of 8).

1. **Case 1: All vertices are red.**
   There is only 1 way for this to happen.

2. **Case 2: The red vertices form a block of length 2.**
   There are 8 possible positions for the block of 2 red vertices (since the block can start at any of the 8 vertices).

3. **Case 3: The red vertices form a block of length 4.**
   There are 8 possible positions for the block of 4 red vertices (since the block can start at any of the 8 vertices).

4. **Case 4: All vertices are blue.**
   There is only 1 way for this to happen.

Adding up all these cases, the total number of favorable colorings is:
\[1 + 8 + 8 + 1 = 18.\]

Therefore, the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all red vertices are in their original positions is:
\[\frac{18}{256} = \frac{9}{128}.\]

Since 9 and 128 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 9 and 128, respectively, so \(m + n = 9 + 128 = 137\).

The final answer is:
\[\boxed{137}.\]","[137, '137']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"To find the sum of the points of intersection of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions and their properties step by step.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( x \geq 0 \) and \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( x < 0 \).
- For \( x \in [-1, 1] \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) if \( x \geq 0 \) and \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{4} \right| \) if \( x < 0 \).

Now, let's consider the function \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq 0 \) and \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| \sin(2\pi x) + \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( \sin(2\pi x) < 0 \).

Similarly, let's consider the function \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| \cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( \cos(3\pi y) \geq 0 \) and \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| \cos(3\pi y) + \frac{1}{2} \right| \) if \( \cos(3\pi y) < 0 \).

Now, let's consider the function \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):
- Since \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \left| f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \right| \).

Similarly, let's consider the function \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):
- Since \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\), \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \left| f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \right| \).

The equations of the graphs are:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

To find the points of intersection, we need to solve:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Since \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) are both functions that range from \(0\) to \(1\), the points of intersection occur when \( y = 1 \) and \( x = 1 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). We will then find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, it is more useful to use the factorization over the integers:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1) = (n^2 + 1)^2 - (n\sqrt{2})^2 = (n^2 + n\sqrt{2} + 1)(n^2 - n\sqrt{2} + 1).
\]
But a simpler approach is to consider the factorization over the reals and then use the fact that the roots of \( n^4 + 1 = 0 \) are \( \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). These roots can be used to form the factorization:
\[
n^4 + 1 = \left(n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1\right)\left(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1\right) = \left(n^2 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}n + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\right)\left(n^2 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}n + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\right)\left(n^2 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}n - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\right)\left(n^2 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}n - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\right).

"To find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to any of its faces, we start by calculating the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron and the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The distance \( r \) from the incenter to any face is given by the formula \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \).

First, we use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with vertices \( A, B, C, D \) is given by:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\
1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\
1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\
1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Substituting the given edge lengths \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \), we get:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
-25600
\]
The volume \( V \) is given by:
\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{-\det} = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{25600} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 160 = \frac{80}{3}
\]

Next, we calculate the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Each face is an isosceles triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). The area of one such triangle can be found using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) of the triangle is:
\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the triangle is:
\[
A = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})}
\]
However, we can also use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) can be found using the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)}
\]
Substituting \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \), we get:
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24\sqrt{21} = 6\sqrt{21}
\]
Since there are four such faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[
S = 4 \cdot 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

Finally, the distance \( r \) from the incenter to any face is:
\[
r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{80}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{80}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{10}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{10\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]
Thus, \( m = 10 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \), and \( m + n + p = 10 + 21 + 63 = 94 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangular prism. Let the dimensions be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The volume of the rectangular prism is given by:
\[abc = 23.\]
The surface area of the rectangular prism is given by:
\[2(ab + bc + ca) = 54.\]
We need to find the jari-jari \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these rectangular prisms. The diameter of this sphere is the maximum distance between any two points on the rectangular prism, which is the space diagonal:
\[d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}.\]
Thus, the radius \(r\) is:
\[r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}.\]
We need to find \(r^2\):
\[r^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4}.\]
To find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we use the identity:
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\]
We already know that \(ab + bc + ca = 27\), so:
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54.\]
To find \(a+b+c\), we use the fact that \(abc = 23\). Since 23 is a prime number, one of the dimensions must be 23 and the other two must be 1. Without loss of generality, let \(a = 23\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 1\). Then:
\[a + b + c = 23 + 1 + 1 = 25.\]
Thus:
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 25^2 - 54 = 625 - 54 = 571.\]
Therefore:
\[r^2 = \frac{571}{4}.\]
The values of \(p\) and \(q\) are 571 and 4, respectively, and they are relatively prime. The sum \(p + q\) is:
\[p + q = 571 + 4 = 575.\]

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each equation using the properties of logarithms. Recall that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\log_b(b) = 1\). Therefore, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting these into the equations, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

We can simplify these equations by multiplying both sides by \(\log(x)\) and \(\log(y)\) respectively:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1. \(x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)\)
2. \(4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)\)

We can solve this system by expressing \(\log(y)\) in terms of \(\log(x)\) from the first equation:

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \cdot \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\) (because \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]

Solving for \(y\), we get:

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now, we substitute \(y = \frac{25}{x}\) back into the expression for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Using the property of logarithms again, we have:

\[
\log\left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = \log(25) - \log(x) = 2 \log(5) - \log(x)
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\log(y)\), we get:

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we multiply both sides by \(x\):

\[
2x \log(5) - x \log(x) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
2x \log(5) = (x + 10) \log(x)
\]

Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\), we get:

\[
2x \log(5) = x + 10
\]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation in \(x\):

\[
2x \log(5) - x - 10 = 0
\]

Factoring out \(x\), we get:

\[
x(2 \log(5) - 1) = 10
\]

Solving for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = \frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}
\]

Now, we substitute \(x = \frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}\) back into the expression for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{25}{x} = \frac{25}{\frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}} = \frac{25(2 \log(5) - 1)}{10} = \frac{5(2 \log(5) - 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \log(25) - 5}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 2 - 5}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

Finally, we find \(xy\):

\[
xy = \left(\frac{10}{2 \log(5) - 1}\right) \cdot \frac{5}{2} = \frac{50}{2(2 \log(5) - 1)} = \frac{25}{2 \log(5) - 1}
\]

However, we can verify that the correct value of \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy the original equations is \(x = 5\) and \(y = 5\), which gives:

\[
xy = 5 \cdot 5 = 25

"To determine the values of \( n \) for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the conditions under which Bob can always force a win. The key is to understand the possible outcomes of each move and how they affect the remaining number of tokens.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Base Cases:**
   - If \( n = 1 \), Alice removes the only token and wins.
   - If \( n = 2 \), Alice removes 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob, and Bob wins.
   - If \( n = 3 \), Alice removes 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for Bob, and Bob wins.
   - If \( n = 4 \), Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 0 tokens for Bob, and Alice wins.

2. **Determine the Winning and Losing Positions:**
   - A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally.
   - A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move will win if both players play optimally.

From the base cases, we can see that:
- \( n = 1 \) is a losing position.
- \( n = 2 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 3 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 4 \) is a losing position.

3. **Generalize the Pattern:**
   - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), Alice can always remove 4 tokens, leaving a multiple of 5 for Bob. Bob will then be forced to remove 1 token, leaving a multiple of 5 for Alice, and this pattern will continue until Alice wins.
   - If \( n \equiv 1, 2, 3, 4 \pmod{5} \), Alice can always remove tokens to leave a multiple of 5 for Bob, ensuring that Bob is always in a losing position.

4. **Find the Values of \( n \) Less Than or Equal to 2024:**
   - We need to count the number of integers \( n \) from 1 to 2024 that are not congruent to 0 modulo 5.
   - The number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are congruent to 0 modulo 5 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).
   - Therefore, the number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are not congruent to 0 modulo 5 is \( 2024 - 404 = 1620 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{1620}\).","[1620, '1620']",809,"[809, '809']",False

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct angles from the set \( S \). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210.
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 4 distinct angles from the set \( \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\} \). This is also given by the combination formula \( \binom{9}{4} \):
\[
\binom{9}{4} = \frac{9!}{4!5!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 126.

The probability that Jen memenangkan hadiah utama is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
\[
\frac{\binom{9}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{126}{210} = \frac{3}{5}.

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of the rectangles and the circle. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangles:**
   - Rectangle \(ABCD\) has \(BC = 16\) and \(AB = 107\).
   - Rectangle \(EFGH\) has \(FG = 17\) and \(EF = 184\).

2. **Understand the geometric configuration:**
   - Points \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear.
   - Points \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(G\) lie on the same circle.

3. **Use the properties of the rectangles:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(AD = BC = 16\) and \(CD = AB = 107\).
   - Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, \(EH = FG = 17\) and \(EF = GH = 184\).

4. **Use the property of the circle:**
   - Points \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(G\) lie on the same circle, which means that quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic.

5. **Determine the length of \(CE\):**
   - Since \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear, \(CE\) is the distance between points \(C\) and \(E\).
   - The length of \(CE\) can be found by considering the relative positions of the rectangles and the circle. However, the specific geometric configuration and the circle property do not change the fact that \(CE\) is the difference in the horizontal distances from \(C\) to \(E\).

6. **Calculate the horizontal distance:**
   - The horizontal distance from \(C\) to \(D\) is \(CD = 107\).
   - The horizontal distance from \(D\) to \(E\) is the same as the horizontal distance from \(D\) to \(F\) because \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear and \(C\) and \(F\) are on the same horizontal line.
   - The horizontal distance from \(D\) to \(F\) is \(DF = EF - DE\). Since \(E\) is on the circle and \(D\) is directly below \(A\) and \(H\), \(DE\) is the same as the vertical distance from \(D\) to \(E\), which is the same as the vertical distance from \(D\) to \(H\), which is \(EH = 17\).
   - Therefore, \(DF = 184 - 17 = 167\).

7. **Combine the distances:**
   - The total horizontal distance from \(C\) to \(E\) is \(CD + DF = 107 + 167 = 274\).

"To determine the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the nature of such paths. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), and the path must change direction exactly four times. This means that the path must have exactly four segments where the direction changes from R to U or from U to R.

We can represent each path as a sequence of 16 moves, where each move is either R or U. The problem then reduces to finding the number of such sequences that have exactly four changes in direction. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's such that there are exactly four positions where the move changes.

To solve this, we can use the concept of ""stars and bars"" in combinatorics. We need to choose 4 positions out of 15 (since there are 16 moves, there are 15 positions where a change can occur) to place the changes. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that each path can be uniquely represented by a sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's, and the number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\).

However, we need to ensure that the path changes direction exactly four times. This means that the path must have exactly four segments where the direction changes. This is a more complex combinatorial problem, but it can be solved using the concept of ""Catalan numbers"". The number of such paths is given by the 4th Catalan number, which is \(C_4 = \frac{1}{5} \binom{8}{4} = \frac{1}{5} \times 70 = 14\).

"To find the real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the reciprocal \(z^{-1} = \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) and \(z^{-1}\) into the expression, we get:

(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use the Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we have:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).

The real part of the expression is:

   - This total distance is equal to the sum of the inradius \(r\) and the radii of the circles tangent to the sides of the triangle.

5. **Inradius Calculation:**
   - The inradius \(r\) of the triangle is the sum of the radii of the circles tangent to the sides plus the distance between the centers of these circles:
     \[
     r = 34 + 34 + 4046 = 4114
     \]

6. **Simplifying the Inradius:**
   - The inradius \(r\) can be expressed as:
     \[
     r = \frac{K}{s}
     \]
   - Since the inradius \(r\) is \(4114\), we have:
     \[
     r = \frac{K}{s} = 4114
     \]

7. **Finding \(m\) and \(n\):**
   - The inradius \(r\) is given as \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers.
   - Since \(r = 4114\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{m}{n} = 4114
     \]
   - Therefore, \(m = 4114\) and \(n = 1\).

8. **Sum \(m + n\):**
   - The sum \(m + n\) is:
     \[
     m + n = 4114 + 1 = 4115
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4115}

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the maximum integer value of \(BD^2\) for a rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, and they intersect at the origin, we can denote the vertices of the rhombus as \(A(a, b)\), \(B(-a, b)\), \(C(-a, -b)\), and \(D(a, -b)\).

Since these points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Substituting \(x = a\) and \(y = b\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1.
\]
To eliminate the denominators, we multiply through by 120:
\[
6a^2 - 5b^2 = 120.
\]
The length of diagonal \(BD\) is \(2b\), so \(BD^2 = (2b)^2 = 4b^2\). We need to maximize \(4b^2\) under the constraint \(6a^2 - 5b^2 = 120\). Solving for \(b^2\) in terms of \(a^2\), we get:
\[
b^2 = \frac{6a^2 - 120}{5}.
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we have:
\[
BD^2 = 4b^2 = 4 \left( \frac{6a^2 - 120}{5} \right) = \frac{24a^2 - 480}{5}.
\]
To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(a^2\). Since \(a^2\) can be arbitrarily large, the expression \(\frac{24a^2 - 480}{5}\) can also be arbitrarily large. However, we are asked to find the maximum integer value of \(BD^2\) for all rhombuses, which means we need to consider the practical constraints of the hyperbola.

The hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) does not have any upper bound on \(a^2\), but the value of \(BD^2\) will be maximized when \(a^2\) is as large as possible within the context of the hyperbola. However, the problem asks for the maximum integer value of \(BD^2\) for all rhombuses, which is not bounded by the hyperbola itself but by the context of the problem.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the hyperbola, the maximum integer value of \(BD^2\) is not bounded by the hyperbola itself but by the context of the problem. Therefore, the maximum integer value of \(BD^2\) is:

"To determine the number of penduduk in Aimeville who have all four items (cincin berlian, satu set tongkat golf, sekop taman, dan sekantong permen hati), we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of penduduk who have cincin berlian.
- Let \( B \) be the set of penduduk who have satu set tongkat golf.
- Let \( C \) be the set of penduduk who have sekop taman.
- Let \( D \) be the set of penduduk who have sekantong permen hati.

- The number of penduduk who have cincin berlian is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of penduduk who have satu set tongkat golf is \( |B| = 367 \).

"Given that \(\triangle ABC\) has a circumcenter \(O\) and an incenter \(I\) such that \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the circumradius \(R = 13\), and the inradius \(r = 6\), we need to find the product \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall the formula that relates the circumradius \(R\), the inradius \(r\), and the distance \(d\) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r).
\]
Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the distance \(d\) between the circumcenter and the incenter is given by:
\[
d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr.
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\) into the formula, we get:
\[
d^2 = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13.
\]
Thus, the distance \(d\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{13}.

Next, we use the formula for the product of the sides of a triangle in terms of the circumradius \(R\), the inradius \(r\), and the distance \(d\) between the circumcenter and the incenter:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{R(R - r)}{d} \cdot BC.
\]
However, we can also use the fact that the product of the sides \(AB\) and \(AC\) can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the inradius as:
\[
AB \cdot AC = R^2 - 2Rr.
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\) into this formula, we get:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13.

"To find the number of triplets \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the second equation. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We can simplify this to:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Next, we need to find non-negative integer solutions to this equation. Let's consider the possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be such that their sum is 300. We will test some possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to see if they satisfy the equation \(100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\).

First, let's try \(a = 100\). Then \(b + c = 200\), and the equation becomes:

\[
100(100b + 100c + bc) - 100bc = 2,000,000.
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
100(100(b + c) + bc) - 100bc = 2,000,000,
\]
\[
100(100 \cdot 200) = 2,000,000,
\]
\[
20,000 = 2,000,000.
\]

This is not true, so \(a = 100\) is not a solution. Next, let's try \(a = 200\). Then \(b + c = 100\), and the equation becomes:

\[
100(200b + 200c + bc) - 200bc = 2,000,000.
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
100(200(b + c) + bc) - 200bc = 2,000,000,
\]
\[
100(200 \cdot 100) = 2,000,000,
\]
\[
20,000 = 2,000,000.
\]

This is not true, so \(a = 200\) is not a solution. Finally, let's try \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\). Then \(a + b + c = 300\), and the equation becomes:

\[
100(100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100) - 100 \cdot 100 \cdot 100 = 2,000,000,

\[
2,900,000 = 2,000,000.

This is not true, so \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\) is not a solution. However, we can see that the only solution is \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\). Therefore, the number of triplets \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given conditions is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) that is not in any of the segments \(\overline{PQ}\) where \(P\) is on the x-axis and \(Q\) is on the y-axis, and the length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1 unit. The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).

First, we find the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The slope of the line passing through \(A\) and \(B\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and the point \(A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
So, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on this line such that \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\) and \(C\) is not in any of the segments \(\overline{PQ}\). The point \(C\) can be parameterized as \(C = (x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}}
\]
We need to find \(x\) such that \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\) and \(C\) is not in any of the segments \(\overline{PQ}\). Since \(C\) is not in any of the segments \(\overline{PQ}\), \(x\) must be in the interval \(\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right)\) and \(x\) must be in the interval \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The intersection of these intervals is \(\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right)\).

We need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies the condition \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\). Let's test the value \(x = \frac{1}{4}\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}

So, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), which means \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\). Therefore, \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, meaning \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:

\[
(x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \(\omega \neq 1\), \(\omega\) satisfies the equation:

\[
\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of the product:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

First, we rewrite the expression inside the product:

\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.
\]

We can use the identity for the sum of a geometric series to simplify the product. Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 13th roots of unity except 1, i.e., \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
P(x) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k).
\]

We need to evaluate the product:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(2 - 2\omega^0 + \omega^{2 \cdot 0}) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2) \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

Now, we need to evaluate:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(P(x)\) can be expressed in terms of its roots. Consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = P(x^2) = x^{24} + x^{22} + \cdots + x^2 + 1\). The roots of \(Q(x)\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}, \omega^{13}, \omega^{14}, \ldots, \omega^{24}\), but since \(\omega^{13} = 1, \omega^{14} = \omega, \ldots, \omega^{24} = \omega^1\), the roots of \(Q(x)\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\) repeated 2 times. Therefore, we can write:

\[
Q(x) = P(x^2) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k)^2.
\]

We need to evaluate:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).

This is equivalent to evaluating \(Q(1)\):

\[
Q(1) = 1^{24} + 1^{22} + \cdots + 1^2 + 1 = 13.

For \( c = 2 \), \( \Delta = 25 \) and \( a = 1 \) or \( a = 5 \). So, \( n = 7 \cdot 1 + 2 = 9 \) or \( n = 7 \cdot 5 + 2 = 37 \). For \( c = 3 \), \( \Delta = 1 \) and \( a = 1 \). So, \( n = 7 \cdot 1 + 3 = 10 \) or \( n = 7 \cdot 5 + 3 = 38 \). For \( c = 4 \), \( \Delta = 1 \) and \( a = 1 \). So, \( n = 7 \cdot 1 + 4 = 11 \) or \( n = 7 \cdot 5 + 4 = 39 \). For \( c = 5 \), \( \Delta = 1 \) and \( a = 1 \). So, \( n = 7 \cdot 1 + 5 = 12 \) or \( n = 7 \cdot 5 + 5 = 40 \). There are ten \( 7 \)-beautiful numbers.

Therefore, the smallest base \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",211,"[211, '211']",False
"To determine the number of parallelograms that can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the parallelogram lies on one of the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of parallelograms and the structure of the dodecagon.

A parallelogram is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, there are 12 sides and 12 diagonals that can be paired to form parallelograms. However, we need to count the number of distinct parallelograms that can be formed.

First, let's consider the sides of the dodecagon. If we choose any two parallel sides, the other two sides must also be parallel to each other and form a parallelogram. In a regular dodecagon, there are 6 pairs of parallel sides (since each side has a parallel side opposite to it).

Next, let's consider the diagonals. If we choose any two parallel diagonals, the other two diagonals must also be parallel to each other and form a parallelogram. In a regular dodecagon, there are 6 pairs of parallel diagonals (since each diagonal has a parallel diagonal opposite to it).

Therefore, the total number of parallelograms that can be formed is the sum of the number of parallelograms formed by the sides and the number of parallelograms formed by the diagonals. This gives us:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of parallelograms that can be formed is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfies all the given conditions and then calculate the sum of the squares of these integers. Let's break down the conditions step by step.

1. **Total Sum**: The sum of the integers in the list is 30.
2. **Unique Mode**: The mode (the number that appears most frequently) is 9, and it appears only once.
3. **Median**: The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

Let's start by considering the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear exactly once in the list. Let's denote the list as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n\). The median is the middle number if \(n\) is odd, or the average of the two middle numbers if \(n\) is even. Since the median is not in the list, it must be the average of the two middle numbers.

Let's try to construct a list with the smallest possible values. Since 9 is the mode and appears only once, the list must include 9. Let's start with the smallest possible values for the other numbers.

If \(n = 5\), the list could be \(a_1, a_2, 9, a_4, a_5\) where \(a_1 < a_2 < 9 < a_4 < a_5\). The median is \(\frac{a_2 + 9}{2}\), which must be an integer and not in the list. Therefore, \(a_2\) must be odd and less than 9. The smallest possible value for \(a_2\) is 1. So, the list is \(1, 9, 3, a_4, a_5\). The sum of the list is \(1 + 9 + 3 + a_4 + a_5 = 13 + a_4 + a_5 = 30\). Therefore, \(a_4 + a_5 = 17\). The smallest possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are 5 and 12 (since they must be greater than 9 and their average is an integer). So, the list is \(1, 9, 3, 5, 12\).

Now, let's verify the conditions:
- The sum is \(1 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 12 = 30\).
- The mode is 9, which appears only once.
- The median is \(\frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7\), which is an integer and not in the list.

The list satisfies all the conditions. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list:
\[1^2 + 9^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 12^2 = 1 + 81 + 9 + 25 + 144 = 260.\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \(\boxed{260}\).","[260, '260']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two-digit numbers formed by reading from left to right is 999, and the sum of the three-digit numbers formed by reading from top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we have the following conditions:
1. The sum of the two-digit numbers formed by reading from left to right is 999. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   10a + b + 10c + e = 999
   \]
2. The sum of the three-digit numbers formed by reading from top to bottom is 99. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 99
   \]

First, let's analyze the first equation:
\[
10a + b + 10c + e = 999
\]
Since \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(e\) are digits (0-9), the maximum value of \(10a + b + 10c + e\) is \(10 \cdot 9 + 9 + 10 \cdot 9 + 9 = 196\). Therefore, it is impossible for \(10a + b + 10c + e\) to equal 999. This means there are no valid ways to fill the grid that satisfy the given conditions.

Thus, the number of ways to fill the grid is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",45,"[45, '45']",False
"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
\sqrt{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
\[
2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}} = 1
\]

This equation is not true, which means there is no solution to the system of equations as given. However, if we assume the problem is asking for the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\) under the correct interpretation, we can proceed as follows:

From the original equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other. Let's solve for \(x\):

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2} \implies x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

Substitute \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into the second equation:

\[
\frac{y}{(yz \sqrt{2})z} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \implies \frac{y}{yz^2 \sqrt{2}} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \implies \frac{1}{z^2 \sqrt{2}} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \implies z^2 = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{3}} \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1}{2^{\frac{5}{6}}} \implies z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

Now substitute \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) back into the expression for \(x\):

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{6}{12} - \frac{5}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Now we have \(x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\) and \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\). We need to find \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}})^4 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12}} = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
y^3 = y^3
\]
\[
z^2 = (2^{-\frac{5}{12}})^2 = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot y^3 \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{\frac{2}{6} - \frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{3}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} = y^7 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y^7}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Taking the absolute value and the logarithm base 2:

\[
\left|\log_2\left(\frac{y^7}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right| = \left|\log_2(y^7) - \log_2(\sqrt{2})\right| = \left|7 \log_2(y) - \frac{1}{2}\right|
\]

Since \(y\) is a positive real number, the minimum value of \(7 \log_2(y) - \frac{1}{2}\) is \(-\frac{1}{2}\) when \(y = 1\). Therefore, the value is:

\[
\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right| = \frac{1}{2}
\]

So, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 2\), and \(m + n = 1 + 2 = 3\).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To find the length of the sides of the regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the hexagon. The hexagon is regular and cembung, meaning all its sides are equal and all its internal angles are equal. Additionally, opposite sides are parallel.

Given that the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are 200, 240, and 300, we can use the fact that the sides of the hexagon are equal to the sides of this triangle. This is because the extensions of the sides of a regular hexagon form a triangle where the sides of the triangle are equal to the sides of the hexagon.

Let the length of each side of the hexagon be \(s\). Since the hexagon is regular, all its sides are equal, and the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are simply the lengths of the sides of the hexagon. Therefore, the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300, which must be equal to the sides of the hexagon.

Thus, the length of each side of the hexagon is the average of these three lengths:
\[
s = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = \frac{740}{3} = 246.67
\]

However, since the problem asks for the length of the sides of the hexagon, and given that the sides of the hexagon are equal, we can conclude that the length of each side of the hexagon is the same as the sides of the triangle. Therefore, the length of each side of the hexagon is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\] (since the problem states that the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300, and the sides of the hexagon are equal to the sides of the triangle, the correct answer is 240).","[240, '240']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) and the sets \( B \) that Bob mentioned. Bob's sets \( B \) are all finite and non-empty subsets of the positive integers, and the maximum element of each \( B \) must be an element of \( A \).

Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). For each \( a_i \) in \( A \), the sets \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as their maximum element are all subsets of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i\} \) that include \( a_i \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i-1} \) because we can either include or exclude each of the \( a_i-1 \) elements less than \( a_i \).

Since Bob has 2024 sets \( B \), the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of the number of sets for each maximum element in \( A \):
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

We need to find the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) that satisfy this equation. Notice that \( 2024 \) can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0

This means that \( a_1 = 11 \), \( a_2 = 10 \), \( a_3 = 9 \), \( a_4 = 8 \), \( a_5 = 7 \), \( a_6 = 6 \), \( a_7 = 5 \), \( a_8 = 4 \), \( a_9 = 3 \), \( a_{10} = 2 \), and \( a_{11} = 1 \). Therefore, the set \( A \) is:
\[
A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = \frac{11(11+1)}{2} = 66

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits.

First, we need to check the divisibility of \( N \) by 7. We will start by testing the largest four-digit number and work our way down until we find the one that meets the condition.

The largest four-digit number is 9999. Let's check if changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

1. Change \( a \) to 1: The number becomes \( 1999 \).
   \[
   1999 \div 7 = 285.5714 \quad \text{(not divisible by 7)}
   \]
   So, 1999 is not divisible by 7.

Since 1999 is not divisible by 7, we need to find a smaller number. Let's try the next largest number, 9998.

2. Change \( a \) to 1: The number becomes \( 1998 \).
   \[
   1998 \div 7 = 285.4286 \quad \text{(not divisible by 7)}
   \]
   So, 1998 is not divisible by 7.

3. Change \( b \) to 1: The number becomes \( 9198 \).
   \[
   9198 \div 7 = 1314 \quad \text{(divisible by 7)}
   \]
   So, 9198 is divisible by 7.

4. Change \( c \) to 1: The number becomes \( 9918 \).
   \[
   9918 \div 7 = 1416.8571 \quad \text{(not divisible by 7)}
   \]
   So, 9918 is not divisible by 7.

5. Change \( d \) to 1: The number becomes \( 9991 \).
   \[
   9991 \div 7 = 1427.2857 \quad \text{(not divisible by 7)}
   \]
   So, 9991 is not divisible by 7.

Since 9198 is divisible by 7 and changing any other digit to 1 results in a number not divisible by 7, 9198 is a candidate for \( N \).

Next, we need to check if there is a larger number than 9198 that also meets the condition. We will continue this process by testing the next largest numbers.

6. Check 9197:
   - Change \( a \) to 1: The number becomes \( 1997 \).
     \[
     1997 \div 7 = 285.2857 \quad \text{(not divisible by 7)}
     \]
     So, 1997 is not divisible by 7.

Since 1997 is not divisible by 7, 9197 is not a candidate.

7. Check 9196:
   - Change \( a \) to 1: The number becomes \( 1996 \).
     \[
     1996 \div 7 = 285.1429 \quad \text{(not divisible by 7)}
     \]
     So, 1996 is not divisible by 7.

Since 1996 is not divisible by 7, 9196 is not a candidate.

8. Check 9195:
   - Change \( a \) to 1: The number becomes \( 1995 \).
     \[
     1995 \div 7 = 285 \quad \text{(divisible by 7)}
     \]
     So, 1995 is divisible by 7.

9. Change \( b \) to 1: The number becomes \( 9115 \).
   \[
   9115 \div 7 = 1302.1429 \quad \text{(not divisible by 7)}
   \]
   So, 9115 is not divisible by 7.

10. Change \( c \) to 1: The number becomes \( 9155 \).
    \[
    9155 \div 7 = 1307.8571 \quad \text{(not divisible by 7)}
    \]
    So, 9155 is not divisible by 7.

11. Change \( d \) to 1: The number becomes \( 9191 \).
    \[
    9191 \div 7 = 1313 \quad \text{(divisible by 7)}
    \]
    So, 9191 is divisible by 7.

Since 9195 and 9191 are both divisible by 7 and changing any other digit to 1 results in a number not divisible by 7, 9195 and 9191 are candidates for \( N \).

The largest of these candidates is 9195. Therefore, \( N = 9195 \).

Next, we need to find the result of dividing \( N \) by 1000 and then finding the quotient and the remainder.

\[
9195 \div 1000 = 9 \quad \text{(quotient)}
\]
\[
9195 - 9 \times 1000 = 195 \quad \text{(remainder)}
\]

So, \( Q = 9 \) and \( R = 195 \). Therefore, \( Q + R = 9 + 195 = 204 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) touches the sphere \( S \) when it is external to \( S \), and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's define the parameters:
- The radius of the torus \( T \) is \( R = 3 \).
- The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube is \( D = 6 \).
- The radius of the sphere \( S \) is \( R_s = 11 \).

When the torus is external to the sphere, the distance from the center of the torus to the surface of the sphere is \( R_s + R \). The radius \( r_i \) of the circle along which the torus touches the sphere is the distance from the center of the torus to the point on the surface of the sphere that is closest to the center of the torus. This distance is given by:
\[
r_i = \sqrt{(R_s + R)^2 - D^2} = \sqrt{(11 + 3)^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{14^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{196 - 36} = \sqrt{160} = 4\sqrt{10}
\]

When the torus is internal to the sphere, the distance from the center of the torus to the surface of the sphere is \( R_s - R \). The radius \( r_o \) of the circle along which the torus touches the sphere is the distance from the center of the torus to the point on the surface of the sphere that is farthest from the center of the torus. This distance is given by:
\[
r_o = \sqrt{(R_s - R)^2 - D^2} = \sqrt{(11 - 3)^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{64 - 36} = \sqrt{28} = 2\sqrt{7}
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 25 chips (13 white and 12 black) on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and no additional chip can be added without violating this condition.

First, let's consider the placement of the white chips. Since each row and each column must contain chips of the same color, the white chips must form a permutation of the rows and columns. This means that the white chips will form a permutation matrix, where each row and each column has exactly one white chip.

The number of ways to place 13 white chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column has exactly one white chip is given by the number of permutations of 5 elements, which is \(5!\). However, since we only have 13 white chips, we need to choose 13 out of the 25 positions in the grid, which is not possible because there are only 5 rows and 5 columns. Therefore, the only way to place the white chips is to have exactly 5 white chips in each row and each column, which is not possible with 13 white chips.

Now, let's consider the placement of the black chips. Since each row and each column must contain chips of the same color, the black chips must also form a permutation of the rows and columns. This means that the black chips will form a permutation matrix, where each row and each column has exactly one black chip.

The number of ways to place 12 black chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column has exactly one black chip is given by the number of permutations of 5 elements, which is \(5!\). However, since we only have 12 black chips, we need to choose 12 out of the 25 positions in the grid, which is not possible because there are only 5 rows and 5 columns. Therefore, the only way to place the black chips is to have exactly 5 black chips in each row and each column, which is not possible with 12 black chips.

Since it is not possible to place 13 white chips and 12 black chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, the number of ways to do this is 0.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",902,"[902, '902']",True
