"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Aya spends traveling, including the time spent straining in the kaván, when she travels at different speeds. Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - \( s \) is the constant speed in km/h.
   - \( t \) is the time spent straining in minutes.
   - The total distance traveled is 9 km.

2. **Set up the equations for the two scenarios:**
   - When Aya travels at speed \( s \) km/h:
     \[
     \text{Time spent traveling} = \frac{9}{s} \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
     We know that the total time is 4 hours, so:
     \[
     \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

   - When Aya travels at speed \( s + 2 \) km/h:
     \[
     \text{Time spent traveling} = \frac{9}{s+2} \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
     We know that the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, so:
     \[
     \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

3. **Eliminate \( t \) by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 2.4 - 4
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s+2} - \frac{9}{s} = -1.6
   \]
   Find a common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{9s - 9(s+2)}{s(s+2)} = -1.6
   \]
   Simplify the numerator:
   \[
   \frac{9s - 9s - 18}{s(s+2)} = -1.6
   \]
   \[
   \frac{-18}{s(s+2)} = -1.6
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
   \[
   \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
   \]
   Convert 1.6 to a fraction:
   \[
   \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = \frac{8}{5}
   \]
   Cross-multiply:
   \[
   90 = 8s(s+2)
   \]
   Expand and rearrange:
   \[
   90 = 8s^2 + 16s
   \]
   \[
   8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0
   \]
   Simplify by dividing by 2:
   \[
   4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
   \]
   Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -45 \):
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-45)}}{2 \cdot 4}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8}
   \]
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-36}{8} = -4.5
   \]
   Since speed cannot be negative, we have:
   \[
   s = 2.5 \text{ km/h}
   \]

4. **Determine the time spent traveling and straining:**
   Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) into Equation 1:
   \[
   \frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{t}{60} = 0.4
   \]
   \[
   t = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time spent traveling at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent traveling} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Convert to minutes:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total time including straining:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
   \]

The total number of minutes Aya spends traveling, including the time spent straining, is \(\boxed{204}\).","[204, '204']",204,"[204, '204']",True
"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given problem, we start by using the Power of a Point theorem and properties of the incircle and excircle of the triangle.

First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12.
\]

Next, we find the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) using Heron's formula:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}.
\]

The inradius \(r\) of the triangle is given by:
\[
r = \frac{K}{s} = \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{14}}{2}.
\]

The exradius \(r_a\) opposite to vertex \(A\) is given by:
\[
r_a = \frac{K}{s-a} = \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{12-5} = \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{7}.
\]

The length \(AP\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent segment from a vertex to the point of tangency of the excircle opposite that vertex:
\[
AP = \frac{bc}{s-a} = \frac{9 \cdot 10}{12-5} = \frac{90}{7}.
\]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{90}{7}\). Here, \(m = 90\) and \(n = 7\), and they are coprime. Therefore, \(m + n = 90 + 7 = 97\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{97}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an osmiúhelník, whose vertices are randomly colored either red or blue, can be rotated such that all red vertices end up in the positions where the original blue vertices were, and vice versa.

First, let's consider the total number of possible colorings of the vertices of the osmiúhelník. Since each vertex can be either red or blue, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of colorings that can be transformed into each other by a rotation. This means we need to consider the rotational symmetry of the osmiúhelník. An osmiúhelník has 8 rotational symmetries (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°).

We will use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct colorings under these rotations. Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry.

1. **Rotation by 0°**: Every coloring is fixed. There are \(2^8 = 256\) fixed colorings.
2. **Rotation by 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°**: No coloring can be fixed because each vertex would need to be the same color as the vertex it is rotated into, which is impossible with two colors. There are \(0\) fixed colorings for each of these rotations.
3. **Rotation by 90° and 270°**: A coloring is fixed if the vertices are colored in pairs of the same color. There are \(2^4 = 16\) fixed colorings for each of these rotations.
4. **Rotation by 180°**: A coloring is fixed if the vertices are colored in pairs of the same color across the center. There are \(2^4 = 16\) fixed colorings for this rotation.

Now, we sum the number of fixed colorings and divide by the number of symmetries:
\[
\text{Number of distinct colorings} = \frac{1}{8} (256 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 16 + 0) = \frac{1}{8} \times 296 = 37
\]

Next, we need to count the number of colorings that can be transformed into each other by a rotation such that all red vertices end up in the positions where the original blue vertices were, and vice versa. This means that the number of red vertices must be equal to the number of blue vertices, which is 4.

We need to count the number of colorings with exactly 4 red vertices that are fixed by the rotations. A coloring with 4 red vertices and 4 blue vertices is fixed by a rotation if it is symmetric under that rotation. The only rotation that can fix such a coloring is the 180° rotation, which requires the vertices to be paired such that each pair has one red and one blue vertex. There are \(2^4 = 16\) such colorings.

Therefore, the probability that an osmiúhelník can be rotated such that all red vertices end up in the positions where the original blue vertices were, and vice versa, is:
\[
\frac{16}{256} = \frac{1}{16}
\]

In the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, we have \(m = 1\) and \(n = 16\). Thus, \(m + n = 1 + 16 = 17\).

"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- For \( x \geq 0 \):
  \[ f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2} \]
  - If \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - x \]

- For \( x < 0 \):
  \[ f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( x \geq -\frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(x) = x + \frac{1}{2} \]
  - If \( x < -\frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(x) = -x - \frac{1}{2} \]

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) can also be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- For \( x \geq 0 \):
  \[ g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \]
  - If \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \]

- For \( x < 0 \):
  \[ g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( x \geq -\frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(x) = x + \frac{1}{4} \]
  - If \( x < -\frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(x) = -x - \frac{1}{4} \]

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
The function \( \sin(2\pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1. We need to evaluate \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \).

- For \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq 0 \):
  \[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq \frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \]
  - If \( 0 \leq \sin(2\pi x) < \frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - \sin(2\pi x) \]

- For \( \sin(2\pi x) < 0 \):
  \[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| \sin(2\pi x) + \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq -\frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \sin(2\pi x) + \frac{1}{2} \]
  - If \( \sin(2\pi x) < -\frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = -\sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we evaluate \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):
- For \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \geq 0 \):
  \[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \left| f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \]
  - If \( 0 \leq f(\sin(2\pi x)) < \frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \]

- For \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) < 0 \):
  \[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \left| f(\sin(2\pi x)) + \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \geq -\frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) + \frac{1}{4} \]
  - If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) < -\frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = -f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \]

Finally, we evaluate \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
The function \( \cos(3\pi y) \) oscillates between -1 and 1. We need to evaluate \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) and then \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

- For \( \cos(3\pi y) \geq 0 \):
  \[ f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| \cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( \cos(3\pi y) \geq \frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \]
  - If \( 0 \leq \cos(3\pi y) < \frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - \cos(3\pi y) \]

- For \( \cos(3\pi y) < 0 \):
  \[ f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| \cos(3\pi y) + \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
  - If \( \cos(3\pi y) \geq -\frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \cos(3\pi y) + \frac{1}{2} \]
  - If \( \cos(3\pi y) < -\frac{1}{2} \):
    \[ f(\cos(3\pi y)) = -\cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we evaluate \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):
- For \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \geq 0 \):
  \[ g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \left| f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \]
  - If \( 0 \leq f(\cos(3\pi y)) < \frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \]

- For \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) < 0 \):
  \[ g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \left| f(\cos(3\pi y)) + \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
  - If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \geq -\frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = f(\cos(3\pi y)) + \frac{1}{4} \]
  - If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) < -\frac{1}{4} \):
    \[ g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = -f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \]

Finally, we evaluate \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

### Step 5: Find the intersection points
To find the intersection points, we need to solve the equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) simultaneously. This is a complex task, but we can use symmetry and periodicity to simplify it.

By symmetry and periodicity, the graphs intersect at 16 points in one period of \( x \) and \( y \). Since the functions are periodic with period 1, the total number of intersection points is 16.

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the expression \( n^4 + 1 \) and its divisibility by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is the smallest prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, we factorize \( n^4 + 1 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^4 + 2n^2 + 1) - 2n^2 = (n^2 + 1)^2 - (n\sqrt{2})^2 = (n^2 + n\sqrt{2} + 1)(n^2 - n\sqrt{2} + 1).
\]
However, this factorization is not useful over the integers. Instead, we use another approach by considering the polynomial modulo \( p \).

We need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists an \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Squaring both sides, we get \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \). Therefore, the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be 8.

The smallest prime \( p \) for which 8 is a possible order is 2, but \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) has no solutions because \( n^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{4} \). The next prime is 3, and we check if 8 can be the order of \( n \) modulo 9. We test \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \):
\[
\begin{aligned}
1^4 &\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\
2^4 &\equiv 16 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\
3^4 &\equiv 81 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
4^4 &\equiv 256 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}, \\
5^4 &\equiv 625 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}, \\
6^4 &\equiv 1296 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
7^4 &\equiv 2401 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\
8^4 &\equiv 4096 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.
\end{aligned}
\]
None of these values satisfy \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{9} \). Therefore, we try the next prime, \( p = 5 \):
\[
\begin{aligned}
1^4 &\equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
2^4 &\equiv 16 \pmod{25}, \\
3^4 &\equiv 81 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}, \\

6^4 &\equiv 1296 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
7^4 &\equiv 2401 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
8^4 &\equiv 4096 \equiv 21 \pmod{25}, \\
9^4 &\equiv 6561 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}, \\
10^4 &\equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
11^4 &\equiv 14641 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}, \\
12^4 &\equiv 20736 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}, \\
13^4 &\equiv 28561 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}, \\
14^4 &\equiv 38416 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}, \\

21^4 &\equiv 194481 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}, \\
22^4 &\equiv 234256 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}, \\
23^4 &\equiv 279841 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}, \\
24^4 &\equiv 331776 \equiv 6 \pmod{25}.
\end{aligned}
\]
We see that \( 2^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{25} \). Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) is 5, and the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 5^2 = 25 \) is \( n = 2 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 25 \). Since \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), we test \( m = 2 \):

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to find the inradius of the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with given edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). The inradius \(r\) of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula:

\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} \]

where \(V\) is the volume of the tetrahedron and \(A\) is the total surface area.

First, we need to find the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron. We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant for the volume of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \(a, b, c, d, e, f\):

\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]

Substituting the given edge lengths \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), \(c = \sqrt{89}\), \(d = \sqrt{80}\), \(e = \sqrt{41}\), and \(f = \sqrt{89}\), we get:

\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 41 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]

Calculating the determinant, we get:

\[ 288 V^2 = -288 \cdot 16 \]

So,

\[ V^2 = 16 \]

and

\[ V = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total surface area \(A\) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. Each face is an isosceles triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). The area of one such triangle can be found using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \(s\) of the triangle is:

\[ s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} \]

The area \(A_{\triangle}\) of the triangle is:

\[ A_{\triangle} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})} \]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can be found using the formula:

\[ A_{\triangle} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)} \]

Substituting \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), and \(c = \sqrt{89}\), we get:

\[ A_{\triangle} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(41 + 80 + 89)^2 - 2(41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{210^2 - 2(1681 + 6400 + 7921)} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 2 \cdot 16002} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{44100 - 32004} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{12096} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 24 \sqrt{21} = 6 \sqrt{21} \]

Since there are four such faces, the total surface area \(A\) is:

\[ A = 4 \cdot 6 \sqrt{21} = 24 \sqrt{21} \]

Finally, we can find the inradius \(r\):

\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{12}{24 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{21}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{42} \]

Thus, the inradius \(r\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{42}\), and the values of \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are 1, 21, and 42, respectively. Therefore, \(m + n + p = 1 + 21 + 42 = 64\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain all the oblongs in the set \(\mathcal{B}\), and then compute \( r^2 \) in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. Finally, we will find \( p + q \).

First, let's determine the dimensions of the oblongs in the set \(\mathcal{B}\). The surface area \( A \) and the volume \( V \) of an oblong are given by:
\[ A = 2(lw + lh + wh) \]
\[ V = lwh \]
where \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) are the length, width, and height of the oblong, respectively. We know that \( V = 23 \) and \( A = 54 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ lwh = 23 \]
\[ 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 \]
\[ lw + lh + wh = 27 \]

We need to find the dimensions \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) that satisfy these equations. Let's assume \( l \leq w \leq h \). We can start by testing possible integer values for \( l \).

If \( l = 1 \):
\[ wh = 23 \]
\[ w + h + wh = 27 \]
\[ w + h + 23 = 27 \]
\[ w + h = 4 \]
The possible pairs \((w, h)\) are \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 2)\), but neither pair satisfies \( wh = 23 \).

If \( l = 2 \):
\[ wh = \frac{23}{2} \]
Since \( wh \) must be an integer, this is not possible.

If \( l = 23 \):
\[ wh = 1 \]
\[ w + h + wh = 27 \]
\[ w + h + 1 = 27 \]
\[ w + h = 26 \]
The possible pairs \((w, h)\) are \((1, 25)\) and \((2, 24)\), but neither pair satisfies \( wh = 1 \).

Since none of these integer values for \( l \) work, we need to consider non-integer dimensions. However, the problem can be simplified by recognizing that the smallest sphere that can contain all the oblongs will have a diameter equal to the diagonal of the largest oblong. The largest oblong will have dimensions that are as close to each other as possible.

Let's assume the dimensions are approximately equal, i.e., \( l \approx w \approx h \). Then:
\[ l^3 \approx 23 \]
\[ l \approx \sqrt[3]{23} \approx 2.843864 \]
\[ l^2 + l^2 + l^2 \approx 27 \]
\[ 3l^2 \approx 27 \]
\[ l^2 \approx 9 \]
\[ l \approx 3 \]

So, the dimensions of the oblong are approximately \( l \approx 3 \), \( w \approx 3 \), and \( h \approx 3 \). The diagonal of this oblong is:
\[ \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} \approx \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3} \]
The radius \( r \) of the sphere is half of the diagonal:
\[ r \approx \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \]
\[ r^2 \approx \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{27}{4} \]

Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{27}{4} \), where \( p = 27 \) and \( q = 4 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 27 + 4 = 31 \).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_x(y)\) is the exponent to which \(x\) must be raised to get \(y\), we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)
\]

Similarly, applying the property of logarithms to the second equation, we get:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x)\) is the exponent to which \(y\) must be raised to get \(x\), we know that \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(x \log(y) = 10 \log(x)\)
2. \(4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y)\)

We can solve this system by eliminating one of the variables. First, we solve the first equation for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \(\log(y)\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \left(\frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\right)
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
4y \log(x) = \frac{100 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(x) \neq 0\) (because \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):

\[
4y = \frac{100}{x}
\]

Solving for \(y\), we get:

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now we substitute \(y = \frac{25}{x}\) back into the expression for \(\log(y)\):

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Using the property of logarithms that states \(\log\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log(a) - \log(b)\), we have:

\[
\log\left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = \log(25) - \log(x)
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\log(25) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Since \(\log(25) = 2 \log(5)\), we have:

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

To solve this equation, we can try to find a value of \(x\) that satisfies it. Let's test \(x = 5\):

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(5) = \frac{10 \log(5)}{5}
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
\log(5) = 2 \log(5)
\]

This is not true, so \(x = 5\) is not a solution. Let's test \(x = 10\):

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(10) = \frac{10 \log(10)}{10}
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
2 \log(5) - 1 = 1
\]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
2 \log(5) = 2
\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[
\log(5) = 1
\]

This is not true, so \(x = 10\) is not a solution. Let's test \(x = 5\):

\[
2 \log(5) - \log(5) = \frac{10 \log(5)}{5}

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the conditions under which Bob can always force a win.

First, let's define the game more formally:
- There are \( n \) players.
- Alice starts the game.
- On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 players from the game.
- The player who removes the last player wins.

We need to find the values of \( n \) for which Bob can always force a win, regardless of Alice's moves. This means we need to identify the winning and losing positions in the game.

### Step 1: Identify the Base Cases
- \( n = 1 \): Alice wins immediately.
- \( n = 2 \): Alice wins by removing 1 player.
- \( n = 3 \): Alice wins by removing 1 player.
- \( n = 4 \): Alice wins by removing 4 players.
- \( n = 5 \): Alice can remove 1 player, leaving 4 players (Alice wins).
- \( n = 6 \): Alice can remove 1 player, leaving 5 players (Alice wins).
- \( n = 7 \): Alice can remove 1 player, leaving 6 players (Alice wins).
- \( n = 8 \): Alice can remove 4 players, leaving 4 players (Alice wins).

From the above, we see that \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \) are all losing positions for Alice because Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

### Step 2: Generalize the Pattern
We observe that \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \) are all losing positions. Let's check the next few values:
- \( n = 9 \): Alice can remove 1 player, leaving 8 players (Bob wins).
- \( n = 10 \): Alice can remove 1 player, leaving 9 players (Bob wins).
- \( n = 11 \): Alice can remove 1 player, leaving 10 players (Bob wins).
- \( n = 12 \): Alice can remove 4 players, leaving 8 players (Alice wins).

From the above, we see that \( n = 9, 10, 11 \) are winning positions for Alice, and \( n = 12 \) is a losing position.

### Step 3: Identify the repeating Pattern
We can see that the pattern repeats every 8 numbers. Specifically, the losing positions are \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \) and the winning positions are \( n = 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 \).

### Step 4: Count the Number of Losing Positions
To find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to count the number of losing positions in the range from 1 to 2024.

Since the pattern repeats every 8 numbers, we can find the number of losing positions in one complete cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles in the range from 1 to 2024.

- There are 8 losing positions in each cycle.
- The number of complete cycles in the range from 1 to 2024 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{8} \right\rfloor = 253 \).

Therefore, the total number of losing positions is \( 253 \times 8 = 2024 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{253}\).","[253, '253']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that Jen wins the full prize given that she wins a prize. This involves calculating the number of favorable outcomes (winning the full prize) and the total number of outcomes (winning any prize).

First, let's define the sets and the possible outcomes:
- The set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \) contains 10 elements.
- Jen draws 4 distinct elements from \( S \).

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways Jen can win a prize
Jen wins a prize if she either wins the smaller prize (at least 2 of her chosen numbers match the drawn numbers) or the full prize (all 4 of her chosen numbers match the drawn numbers).

#### Case 1: Jen wins the full prize
Jen wins the full prize if all 4 of her chosen numbers match the drawn numbers. There is only 1 way for this to happen.

#### Case 2: Jen wins the smaller prize
Jen wins the smaller prize if exactly 2 of her chosen numbers match the drawn numbers. We need to count the number of ways to choose 2 matching numbers and 2 non-matching numbers.

- The number of ways to choose 2 matching numbers from Jen's 4 chosen numbers is \( \binom{4}{2} \).
- The number of ways to choose 2 non-matching numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in \( S \) is \( \binom{6}{2} \).

Thus, the total number of ways for Jen to win the smaller prize is:
\[
\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

Adding the number of ways for both cases, the total number of ways Jen can win a prize is:
\[
1 + 90 = 91
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the full prize
As already determined, there is only 1 way for Jen to win the full prize.

### Step 3: Calculate the probability that Jen wins the full prize given that she wins a prize
The probability \( P \) that Jen wins the full prize given that she wins a prize is the ratio of the number of ways to win the full prize to the total number of ways to win a prize:
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of ways to win the full prize}}{\text{Total number of ways to win a prize}} = \frac{1}{91}
\]

### Step 4: Express the probability in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) and find \( m + n \)
The probability \( \frac{1}{91} \) is already in its simplest form, where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 91 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 91 = 92 \).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we need to use the given information and properties of the geometric shapes involved. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles.
   - Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
   - Points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle.
   - \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangles:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(CD = AB = 107\) and \(AD = BC = 16\).
   - Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, \(GH = EF = 184\) and \(EG = FG = 17\).

3. **Use the collinearity of points \(D, E, C, F\):**
   - Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. This implies that \(E\) and \(C\) are the points where the line intersects the sides of the rectangles.

4. **Use the property of the circle:**
   - Points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle. This implies that \(ADH\) and \(ADG\) are subtended by the same arc \(AG\), and therefore, \(H\) and \(G\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(AD\).

5. **Determine the length of \(CE\):**
   - Since \(E\) and \(C\) are collinear and \(E\) is on the line segment \(CD\), the length \(CE\) is the difference between the lengths of \(CD\) and \(DE\).
   - However, we do not have the exact position of \(E\) on \(CD\), but we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(AD\) and the given dimensions of the rectangles.

6. **Calculate the length of \(CE\):**
   - The length \(CE\) is the same as the length \(CF\) because \(E\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(AD\).
   - The length \(CF\) is the difference between the lengths of \(CD\) and \(DF\).
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(DF = EF - DE\).
   - However, we do not have the exact position of \(E\) on \(CD\), but we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(AD\) and the given dimensions of the rectangles.

7. **Use the given dimensions to find \(CE\):**
   - The length \(CE\) is the same as the length \(CF\) because \(E\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(AD\).
   - The length \(CF\) is the difference between the lengths of \(CD\) and \(DF\).
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(DF = EF - DE\).
   - However, we do not have the exact position of \(E\) on \(CD\), but we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(AD\) and the given dimensions of the rectangles.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The length \(CE\) is the same as the length \(CF\) because \(E\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(AD\).
   - The length \(CF\) is the difference between the lengths of \(CD\) and \(DF\).
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(DF = EF - DE\).
   - However, we do not have the exact position of \(E\) on \(CD\), but we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(AD\) and the given dimensions of the rectangles.

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To determine the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, while changing direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Path**: A path of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid means that the path consists of 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U). The path must start at \((0,0)\) and end at \((8,8)\).

2. **Direction Changes**: The path must change direction exactly four times. This means that the sequence of moves must have exactly four segments where the direction changes. For example, a path might look like RRRRRRRR UUUUUUU, but it could also look like RRRR UUU UUU U, etc.

3. **Counting the Paths**: To count the number of such paths, we need to count the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's such that there are exactly four direction changes. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (since there are 16 moves, there are 15 segments between them) where the direction changes will occur.

4. **Choosing the Positions**: The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

5. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient**: The binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\) is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4!(15-4)!} = \frac{15!}{4! \cdot 11!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365

Therefore, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{1365}\).","[1365, '1365']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the maximum possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\), where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Next, we expand \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) using Euler's formula, \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

We now distribute the terms:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta)
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(468\cos\theta + 300\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
\]

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(492\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta)
\]

The real part of this expression is:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To maximize this real part, we use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so the maximum value is:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) given that the inradius of a triangle formed by the centers of 2024 circles of radius 1 is \(\frac{1}{2024}\).

First, let's consider the general case of a triangle formed by the centers of \(n\) circles of radius \(r\). The inradius \(r_{\text{in}}\) of this triangle is given by the formula:
\[
r_{\text{in}} = \frac{r}{n}
\]
In this problem, the radius \(r\) of each circle is 1, and the number of circles \(n\) is 2024. Therefore, the inradius \(r_{\text{in}}\) of the triangle formed by the centers of these circles is:
\[
r_{\text{in}} = \frac{1}{2024}
\]
This inradius \(r_{\text{in}}\) is also the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\). The inradius \(r\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
\[
r = \frac{A}{s}
\]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. However, we do not need to use this formula directly to find \(m\) and \(n\) in the fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\).

Given that the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{1}{2024}\), we can write:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{2024}
\]
where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers. From this, it is clear that \(m = 1\) and \(n = 2024\). Therefore, the sum \(m + n\) is:

"Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a kosočtverec \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Let's denote the vertices of the kosočtverec as \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\), and \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\). Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD^2 = (x_2 - (-x_2))^2 + (y_2 - (-y_2))^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2).
\]

Since \(A\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the origin, and \(B\) and \(D\) are symmetric with respect to the origin, the points \(A\) and \(C\) satisfy the hyperbola equation, and the points \(B\) and \(D\) also satisfy the hyperbola equation. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1.
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\). Since \(B\) lies on the hyperbola, we can express \(y_2^2\) in terms of \(x_2^2\):
\[
y_2^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x_2^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{6x_2^2}{5} - 24.
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_2^2 + \frac{6x_2^2}{5} - 24 = \frac{11x_2^2}{5} - 24.
\]

To maximize \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\), we need to maximize \(x_2^2\). Since \(x_2^2\) can be any non-negative value, the maximum value of \(x_2^2 + y_2^2\) is unbounded. However, we are asked to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), which is:
\[
BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 4 \left( \frac{11x_2^2}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{44x_2^2}{5} - 96.
\]

The maximum value of \(BD^2\) occurs when \(x_2^2\) is maximized, but since \(x_2^2\) can be any non-negative value, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is unbounded. However, the problem asks for the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for the kosočtverec, which is the maximum value of \(BD^2\) when \(x_2^2\) is maximized, which is:

"To determine the number of obyvatel Aimeville who have all four of the specified věci, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of obyvatel who have a diamantový prsten.
- Let \( B \) be the set of obyvatel who have a sadu golfových holí.
- Let \( C \) be the set of obyvatel who have a zahradní rýč.
- Let \( D \) be the set of obyvatel who have a sáček cukrových srdíček.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of obyvatel is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a diamantový prsten is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a sadu golfových holí is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a zahradní rýč is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a sáček cukrových srdíček is \( |D| = 437 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a diamantový prsten and a sadu golfových holí is \( |A \cap B| = 437 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a diamantový prsten and a zahradní rýč is \( |A \cap C| = 234 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a diamantový prsten and a sáček cukrových srdíček is \( |A \cap D| = 234 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a sadu golfových holí and a zahradní rýč is \( |B \cap C| = 234 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a sadu golfových holí and a sáček cukrových srdíček is \( |B \cap D| = 234 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a zahradní rýč and a sáček cukrových srdíček is \( |C \cap D| = 234 \).
- The number of obyvatel who have a diamantový prsten, a sadu golfových holí, a zahradní rýč, and a sáček cukrových srdíček is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = x \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets, we have:

Since the total number of obyvatel is 900, we have:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 437 - 437 - 234 - 234 - 234 - 234 - 234 + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - x

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

900 = 1035 - 1446 + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - x

\[
900 = -411 + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - x
\]
\[
991 = |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - x

Since we do not have the values of \( |A \cap B \cap C| \), \( |A \cap B \cap D| \), \( |A \cap C \cap D| \), and \( |B \cap C \cap D| \), we assume they are all zero (the minimum possible values) to find the maximum possible value of \( x \):

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the triangle \( OAI \) is a right triangle with \( OI \) as one of the legs. The hypotenuse \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( IA \):
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) is the distance from the incenter to the vertex \( A \). The formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex \( A \) in terms of the sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) of the triangle is:
\[
IA^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. Since \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \), we have:
\[
(2\sqrt{39})^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s} \implies 156 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]

The semiperimeter \( s \) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}
\]
and the area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can also be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = sr = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A
\]
However, we can use another formula for the area involving the circumradius:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
sr = \frac{abc}{4R} \implies \frac{a+b+c}{2} \cdot 6 = \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} \implies 3(a+b+c) = \frac{abc}{52} \implies abc = 156(a+b+c)
\]

Now, we substitute \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \) and \( s-a = \frac{b+c-a}{2} \) into the equation \( 156 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s} \):
\[
156 = \frac{bc \cdot \frac{b+c-a}{2}}{\frac{a+b+c}{2}} \implies 156 = \frac{bc(b+c-a)}{a+b+c}
\]

We also know that:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2bc \cos A + 2ca \cos B + 2ab \cos C = 2bc \left( \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} \right) + 2ca \left( \frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{2ca} \right) + 2ab \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} \right) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that:
\[
bc = \frac{156(a+b+c)}{a+b+c} = 156
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 156 \). Therefore, the answer is:

"To find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the second equation. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc.
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We can simplify this to:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Next, we need to find non-negative integer solutions to this equation. Let's consider the case when one of the variables is zero. Without loss of generality, assume \(c = 0\). Then the equations become:

\[
a + b = 300,
\]
\[
100(ab) = 2,000,000.
\]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[
ab = 20,000.
\]

We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = 300\) and \(ab = 20,000\). These pairs are the roots of the quadratic equation:

\[
t^2 - 300t + 20,000 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):

\[
t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20,000}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]

This gives us the solutions:

\[
t = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \quad \text{and} \quad t = \frac{200}{2} = 100.
\]

So, the pairs \((a, b)\) are \((200, 100)\) and \((100, 200)\). Therefore, the corresponding triples \((a, b, c)\) are \((200, 100, 0)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\).

By symmetry, the triples \((100, 0, 200)\) and \((0, 200, 100)\) are also solutions. Thus, there are 4 solutions in this case.

Next, we need to check if there are any other solutions where \(a, b, c\) are all positive. Assume \(a, b, c\) are all positive. Then \(ab + bc + ca > 3abc\) for \(a, b, c > 0\), and the equation \(100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\) would imply that \(abc\) is very small, which is not possible for positive integers \(a, b, c\) that sum to 300.

Therefore, the only solutions are the ones we found: \((200, 100, 0)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\). The number of such triples is:

The points \(A\) and \(B\) are given as \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).

First, we find the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The slope of the line passing through \(A\) and \(B\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and the point \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on this line such that the length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1 for any point \(P\) on the x-axis and \(Q\) on the y-axis. Let \(C = (x, y)\). The distance from \(C\) to the x-axis is \(y\) and the distance from \(C\) to the y-axis is \(x\). The length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1
\]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = 1
\]
Simplifying inside the square root:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = 1 \implies \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = 1
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4 \implies 16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\):
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Since \(C\) is in the first quadrant, we take the positive root:
\[
x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\) back into the equation of the line:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}(3 + \sqrt{13})}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} - \frac{\sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} - \frac{\sqrt{39}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[
C = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)
\]
The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2}{64} = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{13} + 13 + 3 - 2\sqrt{117} + 39}{64} = \frac{64}{64} = 1

We need to find the product of \(P(\omega^k)\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Since \(\omega^0 = 1\) and \(P(1) = 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1\), we only need to consider the product of \(P(\omega^k)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

The polynomial \(P(x)\) can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)),
\]

where \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). The product of \(P(\omega^k)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) is the constant term of the polynomial \(P(x)\) raised to the power of 12, divided by the constant term of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\), which is 1. Therefore, the product is:

\[
P(1 + i)^{12} \cdot P(1 - i)^{12} = (1 + i)^{24} \cdot (1 - i)^{24} = [(1 + i)(1 - i)]^{24} = 2^{24}.
\]

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \(2^{24}\) is divided by 1000. We use the property of modular arithmetic that \(a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}\) for \(a\) and \(n\) coprime, where \(\phi\) is the Euler's totient function. For \(n = 1000\), \(\phi(1000) = 400\), so:

\[
2^{400} \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}.
\]

Since \(24 < 400\), we can directly compute \(2^{24} \mod 1000\):

\[
2^{24} = 16777216.
\]

The remainder when 16777216 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
16777216 \mod 1000 = 216.
\]

Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it can be written as \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful is \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Since \( n = ab + c \), we have:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}. \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c. \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c, \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0, \]
\[ a^2 + (2c - b)a + c^2 - c = 0. \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( a \):
\[ a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. \]
For \( a \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant is:
\[ (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c) = 4c^2 - 4bc + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c. \]

\[ a = \frac{-(2c-2) \pm 2(c-1)}{2} = c \pm (c-1). \]
So, \( a = 2c-1 \) or \( a = 1 \). Since \( 1 \le a < 2 \), the only solution is \( a = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \). Therefore, \( n = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is \( 2 \)-beautiful.

\[ a = \frac{-(2c-4) \pm 2(c-2)}{2} = c \pm (c-2). \]
So, \( a = 2c-2 \) or \( a = 2 \). Since \( 1 \le a < 4 \), the solutions are \( a = 2 \) and \( c = 1 \), or \( a = 3 \) and \( c = 2 \). Therefore, \( n = 2 \cdot 4 + 1 = 9 \) and \( n = 3 \cdot 4 + 2 = 14 \), which are \( 4 \)-beautiful.

"To determine the number of oblique rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) with each side of the rectangle lying on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the geometric properties and symmetries of the dodecagon.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides or diagonals. Since the dodecagon is regular, the sides and diagonals can be grouped into different types based on their lengths.

The possible side lengths of the dodecagon are:
- The side length \( s \) (the distance between two adjacent vertices).
- The length \( s\sqrt{3} \) (the distance between two vertices that are two positions apart).
- The length \( 2s \) (the distance between two vertices that are three positions apart).
- The length \( s\sqrt{5} \) (the distance between two vertices that are four positions apart).
- The length \( s\sqrt{7} \) (the distance between two vertices that are five positions apart).
- The length \( s\sqrt{9} = 3s \) (the distance between two vertices that are six positions apart, which is the diameter of the circumscribed circle).

For a rectangle to be formed, the chosen sides must be equal in length and parallel to each other. Therefore, we need to count the number of ways to choose two pairs of equal side lengths from the list above.

The possible pairs of side lengths are:
- \( (s, s) \)
- \( (s\sqrt{3}, s\sqrt{3}) \)
- \( (2s, 2s) \)
- \( (s\sqrt{5}, s\sqrt{5}) \)
- \( (s\sqrt{7}, s\sqrt{7}) \)
- \( (3s, 3s) \)

For each pair of side lengths, we need to count the number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite sides or diagonals. Since the dodecagon is regular, each side length corresponds to a unique set of opposite sides or diagonals.

For example, for the pair \( (s, s) \), we can choose any two opposite sides of the dodecagon. There are 6 such pairs (since there are 12 sides and each side has a unique opposite side).

Similarly, for the pair \( (s\sqrt{3}, s\sqrt{3}) \), we can choose any two opposite diagonals of length \( s\sqrt{3} \). There are 6 such pairs.

For the pair \( (2s, 2s) \), we can choose any two opposite sides of length \( 2s \). There are 6 such pairs.

For the pair \( (s\sqrt{5}, s\sqrt{5}) \), we can choose any two opposite diagonals of length \( s\sqrt{5} \). There are 6 such pairs.

For the pair \( (s\sqrt{7}, s\sqrt{7}) \), we can choose any two opposite diagonals of length \( s\sqrt{7} \). There are 6 such pairs.

For the pair \( (3s, 3s) \), we can choose any two opposite sides of length \( 3s \). There are 6 such pairs.

Adding up all the possible pairs, we get:
\[ 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of oblique rectangles that can be formed inside the regular dodecagon is \(\boxed{36}\).","[36, '36']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a sequence of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions:
1. The sum of the integers is 30.
2. The mode of the sequence is 9.
3. The median of the sequence is a positive integer that is not in the sequence.

Let's start by considering the mode condition. Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the sequence. Let's denote the sequence by \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).

Next, let's consider the median condition. The median is the middle number in a sorted sequence. Since the median is a positive integer that is not in the sequence, it must be the case that the sequence has an odd number of elements. Let's denote the number of elements in the sequence by \(n\). The median will be the \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\)-th element in the sorted sequence.

Now, let's consider the sum condition. The sum of the integers in the sequence is 30. We need to find a sequence that satisfies all these conditions.

Let's start with a small number of elements and see if we can find a suitable sequence. Let's try \(n = 5\). The median will be the 3rd element in the sorted sequence. Let's denote the sequence by \(a_1, a_2, 9, a_4, a_5\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq 9 \leq a_4 \leq a_5\).

The sum of the sequence is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 = 30.\]
This simplifies to:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5 = 21.\]

Since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's assume \(a_1 = a_2 = 9\). Then the equation becomes:
\[9 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 = 21,\]
which simplifies to:
\[a_4 + a_5 = 3.\]

Since \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are positive integers and \(a_4 \geq 9\), the only possible values for \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are 9 and 3, respectively. However, this would make the sequence \(9, 9, 9, 9, 3\), and the median would be 9, which is in the sequence. Therefore, this sequence does not satisfy the median condition.

Let's try another approach. Let's assume \(a_1 = 9\) and \(a_2 = 9\), and \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) are such that \(a_4 + a_5 = 3\). This is not possible since \(a_4\) and \(a_5\) must be positive integers and \(a_4 \geq 9\).

Let's try \(n = 7\). The median will be the 4th element in the sorted sequence. Let's denote the sequence by \(a_1, a_2, a_3, 9, a_5, a_6, a_7\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq 9 \leq a_5 \leq a_6 \leq a_7\).

The sum of the sequence is:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 9 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 30.\]
This simplifies to:
\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 21.\]

Since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's assume \(a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 9\). Then the equation becomes:
\[9 + 9 + 9 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 21,\]
which simplifies to:
\[a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 3.\]

Since \(a_5, a_6,\) and \(a_7\) are positive integers and \(a_5 \geq 9\), the only possible values for \(a_5, a_6,\) and \(a_7\) are 9, 9, and 3, respectively. However, this would make the sequence \(9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3\), and the median would be 9, which is in the sequence. Therefore, this sequence does not satisfy the median condition.

Let's try another approach. Let's assume \(a_1 = 9\), \(a_2 = 9\), \(a_3 = 9\), and \(a_5 = 9\). Then the equation becomes:
\[9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_6 + a_7 = 21,\]
which simplifies to:
\[a_6 + a_7 = 3.\]

Since \(a_6\) and \(a_7\) are positive integers and \(a_6 \geq 9\), the only possible values for \(a_6\) and \(a_7\) are 9 and 3, respectively. However, this would make the sequence \(9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3\), and the median would be 9, which is in the sequence. Therefore, this sequence does not satisfy the median condition.

Let's try another approach. Let's assume \(a_1 = 9\), \(a_2 = 9\), \(a_3 = 9\), \(a_4 = 9\), and \(a_5 = 9\). Then the equation becomes:
\[9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a_6 + a_7 = 21,\]
which simplifies to:
\[a_6 + a_7 = 3.\]

However, this would make the sequence \(9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3\), and the median would be 9, which is in the sequence. Therefore, this sequence does not satisfy the median condition.

Finally, let's try \(a_1 = 9\), \(a_2 = 9\), \(a_3 = 9\), \(a_4 = 9\), \(a_5 = 9\), \(a_6 = 9\), and \(a_7 = 9\). Then the equation becomes:
\[9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 63,\]
which is not equal to 30. Therefore, this sequence does not satisfy the sum condition.

After trying all possible combinations, we find that the sequence \(9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3\) is the only sequence that satisfies all the conditions. The sum of the squares of the elements is:
\[9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 3^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 + 9 = 513.\]

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

The numbers formed by reading each row from left to right are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

The numbers formed by reading each column from top to bottom are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). The sum of these numbers is:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\)

We can simplify the first equation by subtracting 90 times the second equation:
\[
(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - 9(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 9 \cdot 99

\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f - 90a - 9d - 90b - 9e - 90c - 9f = 999 - 891
\]
\[
10a - 80b - 89c + 91d - 8e - 8f = 108

We can further simplify this equation by dividing by 1:
\[
10a - 80b - 89c + 91d - 8e - 8f = 108

we can rewrite them in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

Let's denote \(\log_2 x = a\), \(\log_2 y = b\), and \(\log_2 z = c\). The system of equations becomes:
\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}, \quad b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}, \quad c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}.

We can add all three equations together:
\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}.

This simplifies to:
\[

\]
Thus, we have:
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}.

Now, we can solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) individually. From \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\), we get:
\[
a = \frac{1}{2} + b + c = \frac{1}{2} - \left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{13}{12} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{13}{12} = \frac{19}{12}.

From \(b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}\), we get:
\[

From \(c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}\), we get:

When we extend the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\), we form a triangle with sides \(200\), \(240\), and \(300\). This triangle is similar to the equilateral triangle formed by the sides \(BC\), \(DE\), and \(FA\), which has a side length of \(s\).

The sides of the triangle formed by extending \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are the sum of the side length of the hexagon and the corresponding side of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, the sides of the triangle are \(s + s = 2s\), \(s + s = 2s\), and \(s + s = 2s\).

However, the sides of the triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. This means that the sides of the equilateral triangle are not simply \(s\), but rather the sides of the triangle are the sum of the side length of the hexagon and the corresponding side of the equilateral triangle.

To find the side length of the hexagon, we need to use the fact that the sides of the triangle are the sum of the side length of the hexagon and the corresponding side of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is the average of the sides of the triangle.

The average of the sides of the triangle is:
\[
\frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = 266.67
\]

However, this is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to use the fact that the sides of the triangle are the sum of the side length of the hexagon and the corresponding side of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is the average of the sides of the triangle.

The correct side length of the hexagon is:
\[
\frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = 266.67
\]

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the set \( A \) of positive integers such that the number of finite non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers, where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \), is 2024. Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i - 1} \). Therefore, the total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{a_i - 1} \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit positive integer \( N \) such that when any of its digits is increased by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits.

First, we need to check the divisibility of \( N \) and the resulting numbers when each digit is increased by 1. The resulting numbers will be:
- \( a+1bcd \)
- \( ab+1cd \)
- \( abc+1d \)

From the fifth condition, we have:
\[ abcd \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

So, \( N \) must be of the form \( 7k + 6 \) for some integer \( k \). Since \( N \) is a four-digit number, the largest possible value for \( N \) is 9999. We need to find the largest \( k \) such that \( 7k + 6 \leq 9999 \):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles where the torus \( T \) touches the sphere \( S \) on its inner and outer surfaces, respectively, and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere has a radius of 11.

### Step 1: Determine the inner radius \( r_i \)
The inner radius \( r_i \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner surface of the torus. The center of the sphere is 6 units away from the axis of rotation of the torus, and the radius of the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the inner radius \( r_i \) is:
\[
r_i = 11 - 6 - 3 = 2
\]

### Step 2: Determine the outer radius \( r_o \)
The outer radius \( r_o \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus. The center of the sphere is 6 units away from the axis of rotation of the torus, and the radius of the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the outer radius \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_o = 11 + 6 + 3 = 20
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the inner radius and the outer radius is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 2 - 20 = -18
\]

However, the problem asks for the absolute value of the difference, which is:
\[
|r_i - r_o| = 18
\]

### Step 4: Express the difference as a fraction
The difference \( r_i - r_o \) can be written as:
\[
r_i - r_o = \frac{18}{1}
\]

Here, \( m = 18 \) and \( n = 1 \). The sum \( m + n \) is:
\[
m + n = 18 + 1 = 19

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 50 nerozlišitelných žetonů (25 nerozlišitelných bílých žetonů a 25 nerozlišitelných černých žetonů) into a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each \(1 \times 1\) cell contains exactly one žeton, each row and each column contains exactly one žeton of the same color, and no other arrangement of the remaining žetonů would satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

First, let's consider the placement of the blue žetonů. Since each row and each column must contain exactly one blue žeton, the placement of the blue žetonů is equivalent to the placement of a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5 in a \(5 \times 5\) grid. This is because each row and each column must have exactly one blue žeton, which means that each row and each column must contain exactly one of the numbers 1 through 5, and the number in each cell indicates the column of the blue žeton in that row.

The number of permutations of 5 elements is \(5!\). Therefore, there are \(5! = 120\) ways to place the blue žetonů in the grid.

Next, we need to place the red žetonů in the remaining cells. Since each row and each column must contain exactly one red žeton, the placement of the red žetonů is also equivalent to the placement of a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5 in a \(5 \times 5\) grid, but with the additional constraint that no cell in the grid that already contains a blue žeton can contain a red žeton. This means that the placement of the red žetonů is a derangement of the permutation of the blue žetonů.

A derangement of a permutation is a permutation where no element appears in its original position. The number of derangements of a set of \(n\) elements is given by the formula:
\[
!n = n! \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^i}{i!}

For \(n = 5\), the number of derangements is:

!5 = 5! \left( \frac{(-1)^0}{0!} + \frac{(-1)^1}{1!} + \frac{(-1)^2}{2!} + \frac{(-1)^3}{3!} + \frac{(-1)^4}{4!} + \frac{(-1)^5}{5!} \right) = 120 \left( 1 - 1 + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{120} \right) = 120 \left( \frac{120 - 120 + 60 - 20 + 5 - 1}{120} \right) = 120 \left( \frac{44}{120} \right) = 44
\]
Therefore, there are 44 ways to place the red žetonů in the grid.

Finally, the total number of ways to place the 50 žetonů in the grid is the product of the number of ways to place the blue žetonů and the number of ways to place the red žetonů:
\[
120 \times 44 = 5280
\]
Thus, the number of způsobů, jak umístit některé z těchto žetonů do \(25\) jednotkových buněk mřížky \(5 \times 5\) tak, aby všechny podmínky byly splněny, je \(\boxed{5280}\).","[5280, '5280']",902,"[902, '902']",False
