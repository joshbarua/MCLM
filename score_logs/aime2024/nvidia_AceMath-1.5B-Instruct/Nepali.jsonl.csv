"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance \( s \) and the time \( t \) in minutes when the car travels at \( s \) kilometers per hour and then at \( s+2 \) kilometers per hour, and find the time \( t \) when the car travels at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour.

First, let's convert the time from hours to minutes. The time \( t \) in minutes when the car travels at \( s \) kilometers per hour is \( \frac{4t}{60} = \frac{2t}{3} \) minutes. The time \( t \) in minutes when the car travels at \( s+2 \) kilometers per hour is \( \frac{2 \times 60 + 24}{60} = \frac{144}{60} = 2.4 \) hours, which is \( 2.4 \times 60 = 144 \) minutes.

The distance \( d \) can be expressed in two ways:
1. \( d = s \times \frac{2t}{3} \)
2. \( d = (s+2) \times 2.4 \)

Since both expressions represent the same distance, we can set them equal to each other:
\[ s \times \frac{2t}{3} = (s+2) \times 2.4 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ \frac{2st}{3} = 2.4s + 4.8 \]
\[ 2st = 7.2s + 14.4 \]
\[ 2st - 7.2s = 14.4 \]
\[ s(2t - 7.2) = 14.4 \]
\[ s = \frac{14.4}{2t - 7.2} \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) when the car travels at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour. The time \( t \) in minutes is \( \frac{4t}{60} = \frac{2t}{3} \) minutes. The time \( t \) in minutes when the car travels at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour is \( \frac{4t}{60} = \frac{2t}{3} \) minutes.

The distance \( d \) can be expressed in two ways:
1. \( d = \left( s + \frac{1}{2} \right) \times \frac{2t}{3} \)
2. \( d = s \times \frac{2t}{3} \)

Since both expressions represent the same distance, we can set them equal to each other:
\[ \left( s + \frac{1}{2} \right) \times \frac{2t}{3} = s \times \frac{2t}{3} \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ \frac{2st}{3} + \frac{2t}{6} = s \times \frac{2t}{3} \]
\[ \frac{2st}{3} + \frac{t}{3} = s \times \frac{2t}{3} \]
\[ \frac{2st + t}{3} = s \times \frac{2t}{3} \]
\[ 2st + t = 2st \]
\[ t = 144 \]

Therefore, the time \( t \) when the car travels at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour is \(\boxed{144}\) minutes.","[144, '144']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the area of triangle \(ABC\) using Heron's formula. The sides of the triangle are \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):

\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]

Next, we use Heron's formula to find the area \(K\) of the triangle:

\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]

The area of the triangle can also be expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h
\]

where \(h\) is the altitude from vertex \(A\) to side \(BC\). Solving for \(h\):

\[
6\sqrt{14} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times h \implies h = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]

The altitude \(h\) is also the length of the perpendicular from \(A\) to \(BC\). Since \(D\) is the point where the tangent at \(B\) and the tangent at \(C\) intersect, \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, \(D\) divides \(BC\) in the ratio \(AB:AC = 5:10 = 1:2\). Therefore, \(BD = 3\) and \(CD = 6\).

Using the Power of a Point theorem at point \(D\) with respect to the circle \(\omega\), we have:

\[
BD \cdot DC = AD \cdot DP
\]

However, we can also use the fact that \(AD\) is the angle bisector and the length of the angle bisector in a triangle is given by:

\[
AD = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB+AC)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5+10)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \left(\frac{144}{225}\right)} = \sqrt{50 \cdot \frac{16}{25}} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

Now, we use the fact that \(P\) is the point where the angle bisector \(AD\) intersects the circle \(\omega\). By the property of the angle bisector in a triangle, \(AP\) is the length of the angle bisector from \(A\) to the point of tangency \(P\), which is given by:

\[
AP = \frac{2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos \frac{A}{2}}{AB + AC}
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(AP\) is the length of the angle bisector from \(A\) to the point of tangency \(P\), which is given by:

\[
AP = \frac{2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos \frac{A}{2}}{AB + AC} = \frac{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10 \cdot \cos \frac{A}{2}}{5 + 10} = \frac{100 \cdot \cos \frac{A}{2}}{15} = \frac{20 \cdot \cos \frac{A}{2}}{3}
\]

Using the fact that \(\cos \frac{A}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{s(s-a)}{bc}} = \sqrt{\frac{12 \cdot 7}{5 \cdot 10}} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{50}} = \sqrt{\frac{42}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{5}\), we get:

\[
AP = \frac{20 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{42}}{5}}{3} = \frac{4 \sqrt{42}}{3}
\]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{4 \sqrt{42}}{3}\). The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 4 and 3, respectively, and \(m + n = 4 + 3 = 7\).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties of a regular octagon and the conditions given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a regular octagon.
   - Each vertex of the octagon is colored either red or blue.
   - The number of red vertices is equal to the number of blue vertices, which means there are 4 red vertices and 4 blue vertices.
   - We need to find the probability that all 4 blue vertices are consecutive.

2. **Total Number of Colorings:**
   - The total number of ways to color 8 vertices with 4 red and 4 blue is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\).
   \[
   \binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70
   \]

3. **Number of Favorable Colorings:**
   - A favorable coloring is one where all 4 blue vertices are consecutive. If we fix one blue vertex, the other 3 blue vertices must be the next 3 vertices in a clockwise direction. This means that the blue vertices form a single block of 4 consecutive blue vertices.
   - The red vertices will then be the remaining 4 vertices, which will also form a single block of 4 consecutive red vertices.
   - There is only one way to arrange the vertices such that all 4 blue vertices are consecutive (and the other 4 red vertices are consecutive). This is because the octagon is regular and the vertices are fixed in a circular order.
   - Therefore, there is only 1 favorable coloring.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{1}{70}
   \]

5. **Expressing the Probability in the Form \(\frac{m}{n}\):**
   - Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 70\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, the fraction is in its simplest form.
   - Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 70 = 71\).

"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs of the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the behavior of each function and their intersection points.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is a piecewise function:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2} \)
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - x \)
- For \( x < 0 \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} + x \)

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also a piecewise function:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \)
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \)
- For \( x < 0 \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} + x \)

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
First, consider the function \( \sin(2 \pi x) \). It is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1. We need to evaluate \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and then \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \).

- For \( \sin(2 \pi x) \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \sin(2 \pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \)
- For \( 0 \leq \sin(2 \pi x) < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - \sin(2 \pi x) \)
- For \( \sin(2 \pi x) < 0 \), \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} + \sin(2 \pi x) \)

Next, we evaluate \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \):
- For \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = f(\sin(2 \pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \)
- For \( 0 \leq f(\sin(2 \pi x)) < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
- For \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) < 0 \), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} + f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)

Finally, we multiply by 4 to get \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)
Similarly, consider the function \( \cos(3 \pi y) \). It is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1. We need to evaluate \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) and then \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \).

- For \( \cos(3 \pi y) \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \cos(3 \pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \)
- For \( 0 \leq \cos(3 \pi y) < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - \cos(3 \pi y) \)
- For \( \cos(3 \pi y) < 0 \), \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} + \cos(3 \pi y) \)

Next, we evaluate \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
- For \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = f(\cos(3 \pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \)
- For \( 0 \leq f(\cos(3 \pi y)) < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
- For \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) < 0 \), \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} + f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)

Finally, we multiply by 4 to get \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \).

### Step 5: Find the intersection points
To find the intersection points, we need to solve the system of equations:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]

Given the periodicity and symmetry of the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), and the fact that both \( y \) and \( x \) range from 0 to 4, we can deduce that the graphs intersect at 8 points.

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",385,"[385, '385']",True
"To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \( p \) is a prime number and there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). We need to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( p^2 \) also divides \( m^4 + 1 \).

First, let's consider the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since \( n \) is an integer, we can use another factorization over the integers:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + n\sqrt{-1} + 1)(n^2 - n\sqrt{-1} + 1).
\]
But for our purposes, it is more useful to use the factorization:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) - n(n^2 - 1).
\]
This factorization is not immediately helpful, so let's use another approach. We know that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), so \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}.
\]
This means that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, and 8. If the order is 1 or 2, then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \), which contradicts \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Therefore, the order must be 4 or 8.

Now, let's consider the expression \( m^4 + 1 \). We need to find \( m \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \). If we set \( m = n \), then:
\[
m^4 + 1 = n^4 + 1,
\]
which is divisible by \( p^2 \) by the given condition. Therefore, \( m = n \) is a solution.

Thus, the positive integer \( m \) that satisfies the condition is:
\[
\boxed{n}.

"Given a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each side of the quadrilateral, which is the same for all sides. This distance is the inradius \(r\).

First, we calculate the semiperimeter \(s\) of the quadrilateral:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + CD + DA}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}}{2} = \sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}
\]

Next, we use Brahmagupta's formula for the area \(K\) of a cyclic quadrilateral:
\[
K = \sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}
\]
where \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{89}\), \(c = \sqrt{41}\), and \(d = \sqrt{89}\). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
K = \sqrt{(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{89})(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{89})} = \sqrt{(\sqrt{89})(\sqrt{41})(\sqrt{41})(\sqrt{89})} = \sqrt{41 \cdot 89} = \sqrt{3649}
\]

The inradius \(r\) is given by the formula:
\[
r = \frac{K}{s} = \frac{\sqrt{3649}}{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{3649}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89})(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})} = \frac{\sqrt{3649}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{89 - 41} = \frac{\sqrt{3649}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{48}
\]

Since \(3649 = 61^2\), we have:
\[
r = \frac{61(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{48}
\]

Thus, the inradius \(r\) is \(\frac{61\sqrt{89} - 61\sqrt{41}}{48}\). Here, \(m = 61\), \(n = 89\) or \(41\), and \(p = 48\). Since \(m\) and \(p\) are coprime and \(n\) is a prime number, we can take \(m = 61\), \(n = 89\), and \(p = 48\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 61 + 89 + 48 = 198\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{198}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the sphere that is tangent to all six faces of the rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius \( r \) is half the distance from the center of the box to any of its faces, so it is equal to half the minimum dimension of the box.

First, let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box by \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The surface area and volume of the box are given by:
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54
\]
\[
abc = 23
\]

We need to find the minimum of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). Let's assume without loss of generality that \( a \leq b \leq c \). Then the minimum dimension is \( a \), and the radius \( r \) of the sphere is:
\[
r = \frac{a}{2}
\]

To find \( a \), we can use the fact that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]

We need to find the value of \( a \) that satisfies this equation. Since \( a \) is the smallest root, we can use numerical methods or trial and error to approximate it. However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the roots \( a + b + c \) is given by:
\[
a + b + c = \frac{(a+b+c)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{2}
\]

We can use the identity:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54

We can use the fact that the sum of the roots \( a + b + c \) is approximately 6.5 (since \( a \) is the smallest root, it must be less than 6.5). Let's try \( a = 2 \):

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each equation using the properties of logarithms. Recall that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\log_b(b) = 1\). Therefore, \(\log_x(x) = 1\) and \(\log_y(y) = 1\). This implies that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\). Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

\[
x \cdot \frac{1}{\log_y(x)} = 10
\]
\[
\frac{x}{\log_y(x)} = 10
\]
\[
x = 10 \log_y(x)
\]

Now, substitute \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{\log_x(y)}\) into the second equation:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{1}{\log_x(y)} = 10
\]
\[
\frac{4y}{\log_x(y)} = 10
\]
\[
4y = 10 \log_x(y)
\]
\[
2y = 5 \log_x(y)
\]
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log_x(y)\):

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}
\]
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Equating these two expressions, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\log_y(x)} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{\log_x(y)}\), we substitute \(\log_x(y) = \frac{2y}{5}\) into this equation:

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}\) back into the expression \(x = 10 \log_y(x)\):

\[
x = 10 \cdot \frac{5}{2y}
\]
\[
x = \frac{50}{2y}
\]
\[
x = \frac{25}{y}
\]

Now, we need to find \(xy\):

\[
xy = \left(\frac{25}{y}\right) y
\]
\[
xy = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the smallest number \( n \) such that after a series of moves, the number of tokens left is either 0 or 1, and the number of moves is exactly 2024. Each move consists of removing either 1 or 4 tokens from the total number of tokens.

Let's denote the number of tokens left after \( k \) moves as \( n_k \). We start with \( n_0 = n \) and want to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n_{2024} = 0 \) or \( n_{2024} = 1 \).

Each move can be represented as either subtracting 1 or subtracting 4 from the current number of tokens. We can express the number of tokens left after \( k \) moves as:
\[ n_k = n - a_k - 4b_k \]
where \( a_k \) is the number of times 1 token is removed and \( b_k \) is the number of times 4 tokens are removed. Since there are 2024 moves in total, we have:
\[ a_k + b_k = 2024 \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[ n - a_{2024} - 4b_{2024} = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad n - a_{2024} - 4b_{2024} = 1 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ n = a_{2024} + 4b_{2024} \quad \text{or} \quad n = a_{2024} + 4b_{2024} + 1 \]

To minimize \( n \), we need to minimize \( a_{2024} + 4b_{2024} \). Since \( a_{2024} + b_{2024} = 2024 \), we can express \( a_{2024} \) as:
\[ a_{2024} = 2024 - b_{2024} \]

Substituting this into the expression for \( n \), we get:
\[ n = (2024 - b_{2024}) + 4b_{2024} = 2024 + 3b_{2024} \]

To minimize \( n \), we need to minimize \( b_{2024} \). The smallest non-negative integer value for \( b_{2024} \) is 0. Therefore:
\[ b_{2024} = 0 \]
\[ a_{2024} = 2024 \]
\[ n = 2024 + 3 \cdot 0 = 2024 \]

We need to check if \( n = 2024 \) satisfies the condition that \( n_{2024} = 0 \) or \( n_{2024} = 1 \):
\[ n_{2024} = 2024 - 2024 - 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \]

Thus, \( n = 2024 \) is indeed a valid solution. Therefore, the smallest number \( n \) such that after 2024 moves, the number of tokens left is either 0 or 1 is:
\[ \boxed{2024} \]","[2024, '2024']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the digits of a randomly chosen 4-digit number from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \) is a multiple of 10, and the sum of the digits of a randomly chosen 4-digit number from the set \( S \) is a multiple of 20.

First, let's consider the set \( S \). The set \( S \) contains the digits 1 through 10. We need to find the sum of the digits of all possible 4-digit numbers formed from these digits and check the conditions given in the problem.

### Step 1: Sum of the digits of all possible 4-digit numbers
The sum of the digits of a 4-digit number \( abcd \) (where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits from 1 to 10) is \( a + b + c + d \). We need to find the sum of all such sums for all possible 4-digit numbers.

### Step 2: Probability that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 10
We need to count the number of 4-digit numbers whose sum of digits is a multiple of 10 and divide it by the total number of 4-digit numbers.

### Step 3: Probability that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 20
We need to count the number of 4-digit numbers whose sum of digits is a multiple of 20 and divide it by the total number of 4-digit numbers.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of 4-digit numbers
The total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed from the digits 1 through 10 is \( 10^4 = 10000 \).

### Step 5: Calculate the number of 4-digit numbers whose sum of digits is a multiple of 10
We need to count the number of solutions to the equation \( a + b + c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{10} \) where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits from 1 to 10. This is a complex combinatorial problem, but we can use symmetry and the fact that the sum of the digits modulo 10 is uniformly distributed among the 10 possible residues (0 through 9). Therefore, the number of 4-digit numbers whose sum of digits is a multiple of 10 is \( \frac{10000}{10} = 1000 \).

### Step 6: Calculate the number of 4-digit numbers whose sum of digits is a multiple of 20
We need to count the number of solutions to the equation \( a + b + c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{20} \) where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits from 1 to 10. Since the maximum sum of four digits is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \), the only possible residue is 0. Therefore, the number of 4-digit numbers whose sum of digits is a multiple of 20 is \( \frac{10000}{20} = 500 \).

### Step 7: Calculate the probability
The probability that the sum of the digits of a randomly chosen 4-digit number is a multiple of 10 is \( \frac{1000}{10000} = \frac{1}{10} \). The probability that the sum of the digits of a randomly chosen 4-digit number is a multiple of 20 is \( \frac{500}{10000} = \frac{1}{20} \).

### Step 8: Calculate the combined probability
The combined probability that the sum of the digits of a randomly chosen 4-digit number is a multiple of 10 and the sum of the digits of a randomly chosen 4-digit number is a multiple of 20 is \( \frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{200} \).

### Step 9: Find \( m + n \)
In the fraction \( \frac{1}{200} \), \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 200 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 200 = 201 \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{201} \).","[201, '201']",116,"[116, '116']",False
"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the Power of a Point theorem. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Cyclic Quadrilaterals:**
   - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is cyclic because \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic.
   - Quadrilateral \(DECF\) is cyclic because \(D, E, C, F\) are concyclic.

2. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   The Power of a Point theorem states that for two chords \(AC\) and \(BD\) of a circle intersecting at a point \(P\) inside the circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one chord are equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. In this problem, we can apply this theorem to the cyclic quadrilateral \(DECF\).

3. **Apply the Power of a Point Theorem to Quadrilateral \(DECF\):**
   Let \(CE = x\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are concyclic, the Power of a Point theorem gives us:
   \[
   DE \cdot EC = DC \cdot EF
   \]
   However, we do not have the lengths of \(DE\) and \(DC\) directly. Instead, we can use the fact that \(ABCD\) is cyclic and apply the Power of a Point theorem to the point \(E\) with respect to the circle \(ABCD\).

4. **Apply the Power of a Point Theorem to Quadrilateral \(ABCD\):**
   Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the Power of a Point theorem gives us:
   \[
   AD \cdot DC = AH \cdot DG
   \]
   However, we do not have the lengths of \(AH\) and \(DG\) directly. Instead, we can use the fact that \(ABCD\) is cyclic and apply the Power of a Point theorem to the point \(E\) with respect to the circle \(ABCD\).

5. **Use the Given Lengths:**
   We are given the lengths \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\). Since \(ABCD\) and \(DECF\) are cyclic, we can use the fact that the products of the segments of the chords intersecting at a point inside the circle are equal.

6. **Calculate \(CE\):**
   Since \(D, E, C, F\) are concyclic, we have:
   \[
   DE \cdot EC = DC \cdot EF
   \]
   However, we do not have the lengths of \(DE\) and \(DC\) directly. Instead, we can use the fact that \(ABCD\) is cyclic and apply the Power of a Point theorem to the point \(E\) with respect to the circle \(ABCD\).

   Using the given lengths, we can find that:
   \[
   CE = \sqrt{BC \cdot EF} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 184} = \sqrt{2944} = 16\sqrt{184} = 16 \cdot 2\sqrt{46} = 32\sqrt{46}

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To solve the problem of finding the number of paths in an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, with exactly four right moves and four up moves, we can use combinatorial methods.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to move from the bottom-left corner \((0,0)\) to the top-right corner \((8,8)\).
   - Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U).
   - We need to find paths with exactly 4 right moves and 4 up moves.

2. **Total Moves:**
   - Each path must have a total of 8 moves.
   - We need to choose 4 moves to be right (R) and the remaining 4 moves will automatically be up (U).

3. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The number of ways to choose 4 right moves out of 8 total moves is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\).
   - This is because we are choosing 4 positions out of 8 for the right moves, and the remaining positions will be for the up moves.

4. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient:**
   \[
   \binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4! \cdot (8-4)!} = \frac{8!}{4! \cdot 4!}
   \]
   - Calculate \(8!\):
     \[
     8! = 40320
     \]
   - Calculate \(4!\):
     \[
     4! = 24
     \]
   - Substitute these values into the binomial coefficient formula:
     \[
     \binom{8}{4} = \frac{40320}{24 \cdot 24} = \frac{40320}{576} = 70
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner with exactly 4 right moves and 4 up moves is \(\boxed{70}\).

### Example Path:
To visualize one such path, consider the sequence of moves:
- R, R, R, R, U, U, U, U

This path moves right 4 times and up 4 times, starting from \((0,0)\) to \((4,4)\) and then continuing to \((8,8)\). There are 70 such distinct paths in total.","[70, '70']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"Given that \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), we need to find the real part of the expression \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

First, let's express \( z \) in its polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), we can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) for some real number \( \theta \). The complex conjugate of \( z \) is \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Now, expand each term:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta).
\]

Combine the real and imaginary parts:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(336\sin\theta + 336\cos\theta).
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To find the maximum value of this real part, we can use the fact that \( \cos\theta \) and \( \sin\theta \) are bounded by \(-1\) and \(1\). The expression \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) can be written as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \). Calculate \( R \):
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) is \( 540 \). Therefore, the real part of the given expression is:
\[
\boxed{540}.

"Given a triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB\) and \(BC\) as the sides, we have three circles with radii \(r_1 = 1\), \(r_2 = 2\), and \(r_3 = 34\) that are tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\) in that order. Additionally, there is a circle with radius \(r_4 = 2024\) that is tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\) in that order.

"To find the value of \(BD^2\) for the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with the given conditions, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the asymptotes of the hyperbola:**
   The asymptotes of the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\) are given by the equations \(y = \pm \frac{b}{a} x\). For the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we have \(a^2 = 20\) and \(b^2 = 24\). Therefore, the asymptotes are:
   \[
   y = \pm \frac{\sqrt{24}}{\sqrt{20}} x = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x
   \]

2. **Find the points of intersection of the asymptotes with the hyperbola:**
   The asymptotes intersect the hyperbola at the points where \(y = \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\) and \(y = -\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\). Substitute \(y = \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\) into the hyperbola equation:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{\left(\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\right)^2}{24} = 1
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{\frac{6}{5} x^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{6 x^2}{120} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{x^2}{20} = 1 \implies 0 = 1
   \]
   This is a contradiction, so the asymptotes do not intersect the hyperbola at any finite points. However, the points of intersection of the asymptotes with the hyperbola are the points where the hyperbola approaches the asymptotes, which are at infinity. Instead, we need to consider the points where the hyperbola intersects the lines \(x = \pm a\) and \(y = \pm b\).

3. **Find the points of intersection of the hyperbola with the lines \(x = \pm a\) and \(y = \pm b\):**
   For \(x = \pm a = \pm \sqrt{20} = \pm 2\sqrt{5}\), substitute \(x = 2\sqrt{5}\) into the hyperbola equation:
   \[
   \frac{(2\sqrt{5})^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{20}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \implies 1 - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \implies -\frac{y^2}{24} = 0 \implies y = 0
   \]
   So, the points are \((2\sqrt{5}, 0)\) and \((-2\sqrt{5}, 0)\).

   For \(y = \pm b = \pm \sqrt{24} = \pm 2\sqrt{6}\), substitute \(y = 2\sqrt{6}\) into the hyperbola equation:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{(2\sqrt{6})^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{24}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} = 2 \implies x^2 = 40 \implies x = \pm 2\sqrt{10}
   \]
   So, the points are \((2\sqrt{10}, 2\sqrt{6})\) and \((-2\sqrt{10}, 2\sqrt{6})\).

4. **Identify the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\):**
   The points are \(A = (2\sqrt{5}, 0)\), \(B = (2\sqrt{10}, 2\sqrt{6})\), \(C = (-2\sqrt{10}, 2\sqrt{6})\), and \(D = (-2\sqrt{5}, 0)\).

5. **Find the length of \(BD\):**
   The distance \(BD\) is the distance between the points \(B = (2\sqrt{10}, 2\sqrt{6})\) and \(D = (-2\sqrt{5}, 0)\):
   \[
   BD = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{10} - (-2\sqrt{5}))^2 + (2\sqrt{6} - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{10} + 2\sqrt{5})^2 + (2\sqrt{6})^2} = \sqrt{4(10 + 2\sqrt{50} + 5) + 24} = \sqrt{4(15 + 2\sqrt{50}) + 24} = \sqrt{60 + 8\sqrt{50} + 24} = \sqrt{84 + 8\sqrt{50}} = \sqrt{84 + 16\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{4(21 + 4\sqrt{2})} = 2\sqrt{21 + 4\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   Therefore, \(BD^2\) is:
   \[
   BD^2 = (2\sqrt{21 + 4\sqrt{2}})^2 = 4(21 + 4\sqrt{2}) = 84 + 16\sqrt{2}

   - 195 players are in the top 195 positions.

   - 900 players received a scholarship, and each player who received a scholarship was chosen as the captain of a baseball team. Therefore, 900 players were chosen as the captain of a baseball team.

6. **Players in the top 900 positions:**
   - Since 900 players received a scholarship, 900 players were in the top 900 positions.

7. **Players in the top 437 positions:**
   - 437 players are in the top 437 positions.

8. **Players in the top 234 positions:**
   - 234 players are in the top 234 positions.

9. **Players in the top 4 positions:**
   - To find the number of players in the top 4 positions, we need to consider the players who are in the top 437 positions but not in the top 234 positions. This is because the players in the top 234 positions are not in the top 4 positions.

   \[

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \), we need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), \( I \) lies on the circle with diameter \( \overline{OA} \). The length of \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). The distance \( IA \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( OIA \):
\[
IA^2 = OA^2 - OI^2 = 13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2 = 169 - 13 = 156
\]
Thus,
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) is also given by the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex:
\[
IA = \sqrt{\frac{(bc(s-a))^2}{s^2}}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the sides opposite to vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively. However, we can use another approach to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed in two ways:
\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin B
\]
Using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter:
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = 6 \cdot s
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin B = 6 \cdot s
\]
We also know that:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
and
\[
\sin B = \frac{2 \Delta}{ac}
\]
Substituting \( \sin B \) in the area equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \frac{2 \Delta}{ac} = 6 \cdot s
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{AB \cdot AC \cdot \Delta}{ac} = 6 \cdot s
\]
Since \( \Delta = 6 \cdot s \):
\[
\frac{AB \cdot AC \cdot 6 \cdot s}{ac} = 6 \cdot s
\]
Canceling \( 6 \cdot s \) from both sides:
\[
\frac{AB \cdot AC}{ac} = 1
\]
Thus,
\[
AB \cdot AC = ac
\]

Using the identity \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2s^2 + 2r^2 + 2R^2 \) and the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we can find that:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 156

Therefore, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To solve for the non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the given expression. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]

Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we can substitute this into the equation to get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]

Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we find:

\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now, we need to find non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\). Let's assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). We can express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\) as \(c = 300 - a - b\). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we have:

\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]

To find a solution, we can try some possible values for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's try \(a = 100\):

\[
100^2 + b^2 + 100b - 300 \cdot 100 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
10,000 + b^2 + 100b - 30,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 200) = 0.
\]

So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a = 100\), we have \(b = 200\). Then \(c = 300 - a - b = 300 - 100 - 200 = 100\).

Thus, the solution is \(a = 100\), \(b = 200\), and \(c = 100\). We can verify this solution by checking both conditions:

1. \(a + b + c = 100 + 200 + 100 = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 100 \cdot 200 + 200 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 = 20,000 + 20,000 + 10,000 = 50,000\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) on line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(\overline{OC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\), and then calculate \(OC^2\).

First, let's find the equation of line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope of } \overline{AB} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, the equation of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the equation of the line perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\) that passes through the origin \(O\). The slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of \(-\sqrt{3}\), which is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\). Therefore, the equation of the perpendicular line is:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]

To find the coordinates of point \(C\), we solve the system of equations:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]

Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Adding \(\sqrt{3}x\) to both sides, we have:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x + \sqrt{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3}x = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Dividing both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{4}{3}x = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{8}
\]

Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into the equation \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Therefore, the coordinates of point \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the 13th roots of unity, which are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} = 1\). These roots can be written as \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 13}\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. This means that \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) are all distinct and satisfy \(\omega^{13} = 1\).

We need to evaluate the expression \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). To do this, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\), which can be factored as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).\]

"To find the smallest positive integer \( n \) that is \( b \)-elegant for \( b \ge 2 \), we need to satisfy two conditions:
1. The number \( n \) has exactly two digits in base \( b \).
2. The sum of the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) has exactly two digits in base \( b \), it can be written as \( ab + c \) where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \).

The sum of the digits is \( a + c \), and we need this to be equal to \( \sqrt{n} \). Therefore, we have:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{ab + c} \]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \]
\[ a^2 + (2c - b)a + c^2 - c = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in \( a \). For \( a \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c) \]
\[ \Delta = 4c^2 - 4bc + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c \]
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4bc + 4c \]
\[ \Delta = (b - 2c)^2 \]

Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we can solve for \( a \):
\[ a = \frac{-(2c - b) \pm (b - 2c)}{2} \]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c - b) + (b - 2c)}{2} = \frac{-4c + 2b}{2} = b - 2c \]
\[ a = \frac{-(2c - b) - (b - 2c)}{2} = \frac{-2c + b - b + 2c}{2} = 0 \]

Since \( a \) must be a positive integer and \( 1 \le a < b \), we discard \( a = 0 \) and take \( a = b - 2c \). Substituting \( a = b - 2c \) back into the expression for \( n \), we get:
\[ n = ab + c = (b - 2c)b + c = b^2 - 2bc + c \]

We also need \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \):
\[ (b - 2c) + c = \sqrt{b^2 - 2bc + c} \]
\[ b - c = \sqrt{b^2 - 2bc + c} \]

Squaring both sides again, we get:
\[ (b - c)^2 = b^2 - 2bc + c \]
\[ b^2 - 2bc + c^2 = b^2 - 2bc + c \]
\[ c^2 = c \]
\[ c(c - 1) = 0 \]

So, \( c \) can be either 0 or 1. If \( c = 0 \), then \( a = b \), but \( a \) must be less than \( b \), so \( c \) cannot be 0. Therefore, \( c = 1 \). Substituting \( c = 1 \) back into the expression for \( n \), we get:
\[ n = b^2 - 2b \cdot 1 + 1 = b^2 - 2b + 1 = (b - 1)^2 \]

The smallest positive integer \( n \) occurs when \( b = 2 \):
\[ n = (2 - 1)^2 = 1 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many triangles can be formed by drawing lines from the vertices of a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) to the sides of the dodecagon. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the vertices and sides of the dodecagon:**
   A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices and 12 sides.

2. **Choose a vertex and a side:**
   For each vertex of the dodecagon, we can draw a line to any of the 12 sides. This gives us 12 possible lines for each vertex.

3. **Form triangles:**
   Each line drawn from a vertex to a side will form a triangle with the two adjacent sides of the dodecagon. Since there are 12 vertices and each vertex can form 12 triangles, the total number of triangles is:
   \[
   12 \times 12 = 144
   \]

4. **Verify the count:**
   To ensure that we have not counted any triangle more than once, consider that each triangle is formed by a unique vertex and a unique side. Since each side of the dodecagon is shared by two vertices, each triangle is counted exactly once in our calculation.

Therefore, the total number of triangles that can be formed is \(\boxed{144}\).","[144, '144']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a set of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions. Let's denote the set of integers by \( S = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n \).

The conditions are:
1. The sum of the integers is 30: \( a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 30 \).
2. The median of the integers is 9: \( a_{\lceil n/2 \rceil} = 9 \).
3. The mean of the integers is positive: \( \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} > 0 \), which is true since all \( a_i \) are positive.

Let's start by considering the smallest possible value for \( n \). Since the median is 9, \( n \) must be odd (because the median of an even number of integers is the average of the two middle integers). Let's try \( n = 5 \).

If \( n = 5 \), the median is the third element, so \( a_3 = 9 \). The sum of the integers is 30, so we have:
\[ a_1 + a_2 + 9 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \]
\[ a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5 = 21 \]

To minimize the sum of the squares, we should choose the smallest possible values for \( a_1, a_2, a_4, \) and \( a_5 \). Since \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq 9 \leq a_4 \leq a_5 \), the smallest possible values are \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_4 = 9 \), and \( a_5 = 9 \). This gives:
\[ 1 + 2 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 30 \]
\[ 1^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 248 \]

Now, let's verify that this set satisfies all the conditions:
1. The sum is 30.
2. The median is 9.
3. The mean is \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \), which is positive.

"To solve the problem, we need to find a 3x3 grid of numbers such that the sum of the numbers in the top row is 999 and the sum of the numbers in the bottom row is 99. Additionally, the sum of the numbers in the left column is 999 and the sum of the numbers in the right column is 99. The grid should be filled with the numbers 0, 8, 9, and 991, with each number appearing exactly once.

Let's denote the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
g & h & i \\
\hline
\end{array}

From the problem, we have the following conditions:
1. \(a + b + c = 999\)
2. \(g + h + i = 99\)
3. \(a + d + g = 999\)
4. \(c + f + i = 99\)

We also know that the numbers 0, 8, 9, and 991 must be used exactly once in the grid. Let's try to place these numbers in the grid and check if they satisfy all the conditions.

First, let's place 991 in the bottom right corner (i = 991). Then, the sum of the right column is:
\[c + f + 991 = 99 \implies c + f = 99 - 991 = -992\]
This is not possible since all the numbers are positive. Therefore, 991 cannot be in the bottom right corner.

Next, let's try placing 991 in the bottom left corner (g = 991). Then, the sum of the left column is:
\[a + d + 991 = 999 \implies a + d = 999 - 991 = 8\]
The only pair of numbers that add up to 8 is 8 and 0. So, we can place 8 in a and d, and 0 in the other. Let's try placing 8 in the top left corner (a = 8) and 0 in the bottom middle (d = 0). Then, the sum of the top row is:
\[8 + b + c = 999 \implies b + c = 999 - 8 = 991\]
The only pair of numbers that add up to 991 is 991 and 0. So, we can place 991 in the top middle (b = 991) and 0 in the bottom right (c = 0). Now, the grid looks like this:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
8 & 991 & 0 \\
\hline
0 & e & f \\
\hline
991 & 9 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The sum of the bottom row is:
\[991 + 9 + 0 = 999\]
The sum of the right column is:
\[0 + f + 0 = 99 \implies f = 99\]
The sum of the middle column is:
\[991 + e + 9 = 999 \implies e = 999 - 991 - 9 = 9\]

So, the grid is:

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms. The equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Converting these to exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{xyz}{xyz} = 1
\]

So, we have:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\), we can combine the terms on the right side:

\[
1 = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{7}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Since \(1 = 2^0\), we equate the exponents:

\[
0 = \frac{13}{12}
\]

This equation is not possible, which suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. However, we can still find the value of \(x^4 y^3 z^2\) by using the original equations. From the equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:

\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
z = xy 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Substituting \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
y = (yz \sqrt{2}) z 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 \sqrt{2} 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 2^{\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = yz^2 2^{\frac{5}{6}}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(y\):

\[
1 = z^2 2^{\frac{5}{6}}
\]
\[
z^2 = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]
\[
z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

Substituting \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) into \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\):

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = y \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12} + \frac{6}{12}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]

Substituting \(x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\) and \(z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}\) into \(y = xz 2^{\frac{1}{3}}\):

\[
y = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}) \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12} - \frac{5}{12} + \frac{4}{12}} = y \cdot 2^0 = y
\]

This is consistent. Now, we need to find \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x = y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}}
\]
\[
y = y
\]
\[
z = 2^{-\frac{5}{12}}
\]

\[
x^4 = (y \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{12}})^4 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{4}{12}} = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
y^3 = y^3
\]
\[
z^2 = (2^{-\frac{5}{12}})^2 = 2^{-\frac{10}{12}} = 2^{-\frac{5}{6}}
\]

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = y^4 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot y^3 \cdot 2^{-\frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3} - \frac{5}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{3}{6}} = y^7 \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} = y^7 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y^7}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{y^7 \sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Since \(y = 2^{\frac{1}{12}}\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = \frac{(2^{\frac{1}{12}})^7 \sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2^{\frac{7}{12}} \sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2^{\frac{7}{12}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}}{2} = \frac{2^{\frac{7}{12} + \frac{6}{12}}}{2} = \frac{2^{\frac{13}{12}}}{2} = 2^{\frac{13}{12} - 1} = 2^{\frac{1}{12}}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the elements in the set \( A \) given that \( A \) is a set of positive integers, \( B \) is a set of positive integers that is bounded above by the maximum element of \( A \), and \( B \) contains exactly 2024 elements. Additionally, the maximum element of \( B \) is the same as the maximum element of \( A \).

Let's denote the maximum element of \( A \) by \( n \). Since \( B \) is a set of positive integers bounded above by \( n \) and contains exactly 2024 elements, the set \( B \) must be the set of the first 2024 positive integers that are less than or equal to \( n \). Therefore, \( B = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2024\} \) if \( n \geq 2024 \).

The sum of the elements in the set \( B \) is given by the sum of the first 2024 positive integers:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{2024} k = \frac{2024(2024 + 1)}{2} = \frac{2024 \cdot 2025}{2} = 2049300.
\]

Since the maximum element of \( B \) is the same as the maximum element of \( A \), the maximum element of \( A \) must be \( n \geq 2024 \). The sum of the elements in \( A \) is at least the sum of the elements in \( B \), but it could be larger if \( A \) contains any additional elements greater than the maximum element of \( B \). However, the problem does not provide any information about the other elements of \( A \), so we can only conclude that the sum of the elements in \( A \) is at least 2049300.

Given the information provided, the sum of the elements in \( A \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find a four-digit number \( N \) that is divisible by 7 when its digits are reversed. Let's denote the number \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits. The number \( N \) can be expressed as \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \). When the digits are reversed, the number becomes \( 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \).

According to the problem, the reversed number is divisible by 7. Therefore, we have:
\[ 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

First, we simplify the coefficients modulo 7:
\[ 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Substituting these into the congruence, we get:
\[ 6d + 2c + 3b + a \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

We also know that \( N \) is divisible by 7, so:
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

We now have a system of two congruences:
1. \( 6d + 2c + 3b + a \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

To eliminate one of the variables, we can subtract the second congruence from the first:
\[ (6d + 2c + 3b + a) - (6a + 2b + 3c + d) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5d - 5a - c + b \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5(d - a) + (b - c) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5(d - a) \equiv c - b \pmod{7} \]

We need to find values of \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) that satisfy both congruences. Let's try some values for \( a \) and \( d \) and see if we can find a solution.

If \( a = 1 \) and \( d = 6 \):
\[ 5(6 - 1) \equiv c - b \pmod{7} \]
\[ 25 \equiv c - b \pmod{7} \]
\[ 4 \equiv c - b \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv b + 4 \pmod{7} \]

Substituting \( a = 1 \), \( d = 6 \), and \( c = b + 4 \) into the second congruence:
\[ 6(1) + 2b + 3(b + 4) + 6 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6 + 2b + 3b + 12 + 6 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 24 + 5b \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3 + 5b \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5b \equiv -3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

To solve for \( b \), we need the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7. The inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3 because \( 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \). Therefore:
\[ b \equiv 4 \cdot 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 12 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

So, \( b = 5 \) and \( c = b + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 \). The number \( N \) is \( 1596 \).

To verify, we check the reversed number \( 6951 \):
\[ 6951 \div 7 = 993 \]
Since 6951 is divisible by 7, the solution is correct.

Now, we need to find the prime factorization of 1596:
\[ 1596 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 19 \]

The prime factors are 2, 3, 7, and 19. The largest prime factor is 19. Therefore, \( Q = 19 \) and \( R = 1 \) (since \( Q \) and \( R \) are the largest and smallest prime factors, respectively).

Finally, we find \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 19 + 1 = 20 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the two circles that are tangent to the circle \( T \) and the sphere \( S \) respectively, and then express this difference in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers. Finally, we need to find the sum \( m + n \).

First, let's define the given parameters:
- The radius of the circle \( T \) is \( R = 6 \).
- The radius of the sphere \( S \) is \( R_s = 11 \).

### Step 1: Find the radius \( r_i \) of the inner tangent circle
The inner tangent circle is tangent to the circle \( T \) and the sphere \( S \) on the same side of the plane of the circle \( T \). The distance from the center of the sphere \( S \) to the center of the circle \( T \) is \( R_s - R = 11 - 6 = 5 \).

The radius \( r_i \) of the inner tangent circle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle \( T \), and the radius of the inner tangent circle. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the sphere \( S \), one leg is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle \( T \), and the other leg is the radius of the inner tangent circle.

Thus, we have:
\[
R_s^2 = (R_s - R)^2 + r_i^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
11^2 = 5^2 + r_i^2
\]
\[
121 = 25 + r_i^2
\]
\[
r_i^2 = 96
\]
\[
r_i = \sqrt{96} = 4\sqrt{6}
\]

### Step 2: Find the radius \( r_o \) of the outer tangent circle
The outer tangent circle is tangent to the circle \( T \) and the sphere \( S \) on opposite sides of the plane of the circle \( T \). The distance from the center of the sphere \( S \) to the center of the circle \( T \) is still \( R_s - R = 11 - 6 = 5 \).

The radius \( r_o \) of the outer tangent circle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the sphere \( S \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle \( T \), and the radius of the outer tangent circle. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the sphere \( S \), one leg is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle \( T \), and the other leg is the radius of the outer tangent circle.

Thus, we have:
\[
R_s^2 = (R_s + R)^2 + r_o^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
11^2 = 17^2 + r_o^2
\]
\[
121 = 289 + r_o^2
\]
\[
r_o^2 = -168
\]
\[
r_o = \sqrt{168} = 2\sqrt{42}
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
\[
r_i - r_o = 4\sqrt{6} - 2\sqrt{42}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the expression
To simplify \( r_i - r_o \), we need to express it in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \). However, the expression \( 4\sqrt{6} - 2\sqrt{42} \) is already in its simplest form and cannot be further simplified to a fraction with coprime integers.

Thus, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{4\sqrt{6} - 2\sqrt{42}}{1}}
\]

### Step 5: Find the sum \( m + n \)
Since \( m = 4\sqrt{6} - 2\sqrt{42} \) and \( n = 1 \), the sum \( m + n \) is:
\[
\boxed{4\sqrt{6} - 2\sqrt{42} + 1}

"To solve this problem, we need to find a way to place 25 chips in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip, and the chips form a pattern where each chip is either the maximum chip in its row or its column. Additionally, the chips must be placed in such a way that there are exactly two chips in each of the two diagonals.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the constraints:**
   - Each row and each column must contain exactly one chip.
   - Each chip must be the maximum chip in its row or its column.
   - There must be exactly two chips on each of the two diagonals.

2. **Visualize the grid:**
   A 5x5 grid can be visualized as follows:
   \[
   \begin{array}{ccccc}
   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
   6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\

   21 & 22 & 23 & 24 & 25 \\
   \end{array}

3. **Place the chips:**
   Since each chip must be the maximum chip in its row or its column, the chips must be placed in the cells with the highest values in their respective rows and columns. Additionally, we need to ensure that there are exactly two chips on each diagonal.

   Let's start by placing the chips on the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right):
   - Place a chip in cell (1,1) with value 1.
   - Place a chip in cell (2,2) with value 7.
   - Place a chip in cell (3,3) with value 13.
   - Place a chip in cell (4,4) with value 19.
   - Place a chip in cell (5,5) with value 25.

   Now, we need to place the remaining 20 chips such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip, and each chip is the maximum chip in its row or its column. We also need to ensure that there are exactly two chips on each diagonal.

   Let's place the chips on the anti-diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left):
   - Place a chip in cell (1,5) with value 5.
   - Place a chip in cell (2,4) with value 9.
   - Place a chip in cell (3,3) with value 13 (but this cell is already occupied by the chip in cell (3,3) on the main diagonal, so we need to place a different chip).
   - Place a chip in cell (4,2) with value 17.
   - Place a chip in cell (5,1) with value 21.

   Now, we need to place the remaining 15 chips such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip, and each chip is the maximum chip in its row or its column. We also need to ensure that there are exactly two chips on each diagonal.

   Let's place the remaining chips in the grid:
   - Place a chip in cell (1,3) with value 3.
   - Place a chip in cell (2,5) with value 10.
   - Place a chip in cell (3,1) with value 11.
   - Place a chip in cell (4,5) with value 20.
   - Place a chip in cell (5,4) with value 24.

   Now, we need to place the remaining 10 chips such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip, and each chip is the maximum chip in its row or its column. We also need to ensure that there are exactly two chips on each diagonal.

   Let's place the remaining chips in the grid:
   - Place a chip in cell (1,4) with value 4.
   - Place a chip in cell (2,3) with value 8.
   - Place a chip in cell (3,2) with value 12.
   - Place a chip in cell (4,4) with value 19 (but this cell is already occupied by the chip in cell (4,4) on the main diagonal, so we need to place a different chip).
   - Place a chip in cell (5,3) with value 16.

   Now, we need to place the remaining 5 chips such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip, and each chip is the maximum chip in its row or its column. We also need to ensure that there are exactly two chips on each diagonal.

   Let's place the remaining chips in the grid:
   - Place a chip in cell (1,2) with value 2.
   - Place a chip in cell (2,1) with value 6.
   - Place a chip in cell (3,4) with value 14.
   - Place a chip in cell (4,1) with value 16 (but this cell is already occupied by the chip in cell (5,3) on the anti-diagonal, so we need to place a different chip).
   - Place a chip in cell (5,2) with value 15.

   Now, we need to place the remaining 5 chips such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip, and each chip is the maximum chip in its row or its column. We also need to ensure that there are exactly two chips on each diagonal.

   Let's place the remaining chips in the grid:
   - Place a chip in cell (1,5) with value 5 (but this cell is already occupied by the chip in cell (1,5) on the anti-diagonal, so we need to place a different chip).
   - Place a chip in cell (2,4) with value 9 (but this cell is already occupied by the chip in cell (2,4) on the anti-diagonal, so we need to place a different chip).
   - Place a chip in cell (3,3) with value 13 (but this cell is already occupied by the chip in cell (3,3) on the main diagonal, so we need to place a different chip).
   - Place a chip in cell (4,2) with value 17 (but this cell is already occupied by the chip in cell (4,2) on the anti-diagonal, so we need to place a different chip).
   - Place a chip in cell (5,1) with value 21 (but this cell is already occupied by the chip in cell (5,1) on the anti-diagonal, so we need to place a different chip).

   After placing the remaining chips, we can see that the grid is:
   \[
   \begin{array}{ccccc}
   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
   6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\

   21 & 22 & 23 & 24 & 25 \\
