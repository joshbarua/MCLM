"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time \( t \) that Ch away spends in the park and the total time of the walk, given the different speeds and times. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( s \) is the speed in km/h when Ch away walks at his normal speed.
- \( t \) is the time in minutes spent in the park.
- The total time of the walk is 4 hours and \( t \) minutes when Ch away walks at speed \( s \).
- The total time of the walk is 2 hours and 24 minutes when Ch away walks at speed \( s + 2 \).

We can convert the total time into hours for easier calculations:
- 4 hours and \( t \) minutes is \( 4 + \frac{t}{60} \) hours.
- 2 hours and 24 minutes is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2 + \frac{2}{5} = 2.4 \) hours.

The distance Ch away walks is 9 km. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on the time taken:
1. When Ch away walks at speed \( s \):
\[ \frac{9}{s} = 4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
2. When Ch away walks at speed \( s + 2 \):
\[ \frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 \]

First, solve the second equation for \( s \):
\[ \frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 \]
\[ 9 = 2.4(s + 2) \]
\[ 9 = 2.4s + 4.8 \]
\[ 4.2 = 2.4s \]
\[ s = \frac{4.2}{2.4} = \frac{42}{24} = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75 \]

Now substitute \( s = 1.75 \) into the first equation:
\[ \frac{9}{1.75} = 4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ \frac{9}{1.75} = 5.142857 \approx 5.14 \]
\[ 5.14 = 4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ 1.14 = \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ t = 1.14 \times 60 = 68.4 \]

So, the time spent in the park is 68.4 minutes. The total time of the walk is:
\[ 4 + \frac{68.4}{60} = 4 + 1.14 = 5.14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find the time if Ch away walks at speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 1.75 + 0.5 = 2.25 \) km/h. The distance is still 9 km, so the time taken is:
\[ \frac{9}{2.25} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time of the walk is 4 hours and 0 minutes. The final answer is:

"To solve for the length of \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of the tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is given by:
\[DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP.\]

Since \(DB\) and \(DC\) are tangents from \(D\) to the circle, they are equal in length. Let \(DB = DC = x\). Then, we have:
\[x^2 = DA \cdot DP.\]

Next, we use the fact that \(P\) is the point where the line \(AD\) intersects the circle again. By the power of a point theorem at point \(A\), we have:
\[AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC.\]

We know \(AB = 5\), \(AC = 10\), and we need to find \(AP\). Let \(AP = y\) and \(AD = y + DP\). Then:
\[y(y + DP) = 5 \cdot 10 = 50.\]

We also know from the power of a point theorem at \(D\) that:
\[DB^2 = DA \cdot DP.\]
Since \(DB = x\), we have:
\[x^2 = DA \cdot DP.\]

To find \(x\), we use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). By the tangent-secant theorem, we have:
\[DB^2 = DC^2 = AB \cdot AC - BC^2/4.\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[x^2 = 5 \cdot 10 - \frac{9^2}{4} = 50 - \frac{81}{4} = \frac{200 - 81}{4} = \frac{119}{4}.\]
Thus, \(x = \sqrt{\frac{119}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{119}}{2}\).

Now, we substitute \(x\) back into the power of a point equation:
\[y(y + DP) = 50.\]
Since \(DP = \frac{x^2}{y} = \frac{119/4}{y} = \frac{119}{4y}\), we have:
\[y\left(y + \frac{119}{4y}\right) = 50.\]
Multiplying through by \(4y\), we get:
\[4y^2 + 119 = 200.\]
Solving for \(y\), we have:
\[4y^2 = 81 \implies y^2 = \frac{81}{4} \implies y = \frac{9}{2}.\]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{9}{2}\). The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 9 and 2, respectively. Therefore, \(m + n = 9 + 2 = 11\).

The final answer is:
\[\boxed{11}.\]","[11, '11']",113,"[113, '113']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon with vertices colored either black or white at random will have all black vertices on the vertices of the original octagon. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of colorings:**
   Each of the 8 vertices can be either black or white, so there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings of the octagon.

2. **Determine the number of favorable colorings:**
   A favorable coloring is one where all black vertices are on the vertices of the original octagon. This means that the black vertices must be a subset of the 8 vertices, and the white vertices will be the remaining vertices. The number of ways to choose \(k\) black vertices out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{k}\). However, we are interested in the case where all black vertices are on the original octagon, which means we are looking at the case where \(k = 8\). There is only one way to choose all 8 vertices to be black.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that all black vertices are on the original octagon is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there is only 1 favorable outcome (all vertices black) out of 256 possible colorings, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{256}
   \]

4. **Express the probability in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) and find \(m+n\):**
   The probability is already in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 1\) and \(n = 256\). Therefore, \(m+n = 1 + 256 = 257\).

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then determine the number of intersections of the graphs of the given equations.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

We need to find the number of intersections of the graphs of:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \)
- For \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \)

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \)
- For \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \)

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, we need to consider the values of \( f(x) \) for \( x \) in this range:
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) \) in \([-1, -\frac{1}{2}]\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \)
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) \) in \([- \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \)
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) \) in \([\frac{1}{2}, 1]\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \)

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
We need to consider the values of \( g(x) \) for the outputs of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- For \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) in \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)
- For \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) in \([\frac{1}{2}, 1]\), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \)

### Step 5: Analyze \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \)
Similarly, since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, we need to consider the values of \( f(x) \) for \( x \) in this range:
- For \( \cos(3\pi y) \) in \([-1, -\frac{1}{2}]\), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| \)
- For \( \cos(3\pi y) \) in \([- \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| \)
- For \( \cos(3\pi y) \) in \([\frac{1}{2}, 1]\), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \)

### Step 6: Analyze \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
We need to consider the values of \( g(x) \) for the outputs of \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- For \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) in \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \)
- For \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) in \([\frac{1}{2}, 1]\), \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \)

### Step 7: Determine the number of intersections
To find the number of intersections, we need to solve:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Given the complexity of the functions, we need to consider the periodicity and symmetry of the trigonometric functions. The functions \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \) are periodic with periods 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\), respectively. The intersections will occur at points where both \( x \) and \( y \) satisfy the given equations simultaneously.

By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry, we find that there are 8 intersections within one period of the trigonometric functions.

Thus, the number of intersections of the graphs is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists an integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[ n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1). \]
However, this factorization is not useful over the integers. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to find the prime \( p \).

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \implies n^4 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}. \]

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   \[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \implies n^4 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}. \]

4. **For \( p = 17 \):**
   \[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \implies n^4 \equiv 288 \pmod{289}. \]

"To solve for the distance from the incenter \(I\) to any face of the tetrahedron \(ABCD\), we first need to determine the volume and the surface area of the tetrahedron. The given side lengths are \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\).

First, we calculate the area of one of the triangular faces. Consider triangle \(ABC\). Using Heron's formula, we find the semi-perimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80}}{2}
\]
The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) is given by:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]
where \(a = \sqrt{89}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), and \(c = \sqrt{41}\). Plugging in the values, we get:
\[
K = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{80}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} - \sqrt{89}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80} - \sqrt{41}}{2}\right)}
\]
This expression is quite complex, so we use the fact that the area of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can also be found using the formula involving the circumradius \(R\):
\[
K = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The volume \(V\) of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) is given by:
\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & d^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & c^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & c^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & d^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Plugging in the values \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{89}\), \(c = \sqrt{80}\), \(d = \sqrt{89}\), \(e = \sqrt{80}\), and \(f = \sqrt{41}\), we get:
\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Calculating this determinant, we find:
\[
288 V^2 = 288 \times 1680 \implies V^2 = 1680 \implies V = \sqrt{1680} = 4\sqrt{105}
\]
The surface area \(S\) of the tetrahedron is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, the area of each face is the same. Using the area formula for a triangle with sides \(a, b, c\):
\[
K = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{4a^2b^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2}
\]
we find that the area of each face is \(20\sqrt{21}\). Therefore, the total surface area \(S\) is:
\[
S = 4 \times 20\sqrt{21} = 80\sqrt{21}
\]
The distance from the incenter to any face is given by:
\[
d = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times 4\sqrt{105}}{80\sqrt{21}} = \frac{12\sqrt{105}}{80\sqrt{21}} = \frac{3\sqrt{105}}{20\sqrt{21}} = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{20}
\]
Thus, the distance is \(\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{20}\), and \(m = 3\), \(n = 5\), and \(p = 20\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 3 + 5 + 20 = 28\).

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). By the power rule of logarithms, this can be rewritten as:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10.
\]
Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x).
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}.
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). By the power rule of logarithms, this can be rewritten as:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10.
\]
Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y).
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
\log(x) = \frac{10 \log(y)}{4y} = \frac{5 \log(y)}{2y}.
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\)
2. \(\log(x) = \frac{5 \log(y)}{2y}\)

We can substitute the expression for \(\log(y)\) from the first equation into the second equation. From the first equation, we have \(\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\). Substituting this into the second equation gives:
\[
\log(x) = \frac{5 \left(\frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\right)}{2y} = \frac{50 \log(x)}{2xy} = \frac{25 \log(x)}{xy}.
\]
Assuming \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):
\[
1 = \frac{25}{xy}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
xy = 25.
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves, we need to analyze the game's strategy. The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing either 1 or 4 jetons from a pile of \( n \) jetons. The player who takes the last jeton wins.

First, let's define the winning and losing positions:
- A position is a ""winning position"" if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
- A position is a ""losing position"" if any move from that position leaves the opponent in a winning position.

We start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If there is 1 jeton left, the player whose turn it is wins by taking the last jeton. So, \( n = 1 \) is a winning position.
- If there are 2 or 3 jetons left, the player whose turn it is can only leave the opponent with 1 or 3 jetons, respectively, which are winning positions. So, \( n = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \) are losing positions.
- If there are 4 jetons left, the player whose turn it is can take all 4 jetons and win. So, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position.
- If there are 5 or 6 jetons left, the player whose turn it is can leave the opponent with 4 or 2 jetons, respectively, which are winning positions. So, \( n = 5 \) and \( n = 6 \) are losing positions.
- If there are 7 or 8 or 9 jetons left, the player whose turn it is can leave the opponent with 6 or 4 or 1 jetons, respectively, which are winning positions. So, \( n = 7 \), \( n = 8 \), and \( n = 9 \) are losing positions.
- If there are 10 jetons left, the player whose turn it is can take 1 or 4 jetons, leaving the opponent with 9 or 6 jetons, respectively, which are losing positions. So, \( n = 10 \) is a winning position.

From this pattern, we can see that the losing positions are those where the number of jetons is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5. This is because from a losing position, any move will leave the opponent in a winning position, and from a winning position, there is always a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.

To find the number of integers \( n \) from 1 to 2024 that are losing positions, we need to count the integers that are congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5. The sequence of losing positions is:
\[ 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 13, \ldots, 2022, 2023 \]

This sequence can be split into two arithmetic sequences:
1. \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \) (first sequence)
2. \( 3, 8, 13, \ldots, 2023 \) (second sequence)

The first sequence is \( 2 + 5k \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 404 \). The second sequence is \( 3 + 5m \) for \( m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 404 \).

Each sequence has 405 terms. Therefore, the total number of losing positions is:
\[ 405 + 405 = 810 \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{810}\).","[810, '810']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has already won the game. We will use conditional probability for this purpose.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins the grand prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the game.

We need to find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won the game. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

Since winning the grand prize implies winning the game, \( A \cap B = A \). Therefore:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(B) \)
\( B \) is the event that Jen wins the game. Jen wins the game if at least two of her four chosen numbers are among the two numbers drawn. We will calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that fewer than two of her chosen numbers are among the two numbers drawn.

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

#### Case 1: Exactly 0 of her numbers are drawn
The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 8 numbers (since 2 are drawn) is:
\[
\binom{8}{4} = 70
\]

#### Case 2: Exactly 1 of her numbers is drawn
The number of ways to choose 1 number from her 4 chosen numbers and 3 numbers from the remaining 8 numbers is:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{8}{3} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

The total number of ways to draw 2 numbers such that fewer than 2 of her numbers are drawn is:
\[
70 + 224 = 294
\]

Thus, the probability of drawing fewer than 2 of her numbers is:
\[
P(\text{fewer than 2}) = \frac{294}{210} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

Therefore, the probability of winning the game is:
\[
P(B) = 1 - P(\text{fewer than 2}) = 1 - \frac{7}{5} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(A) \)
\( A \) is the event that Jen wins the grand prize. Jen wins the grand prize if all four of her chosen numbers are among the two numbers drawn. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 2 numbers drawn is:
\[
\binom{2}{4} = 0
\]

Thus, the probability of winning the grand prize is:
\[
P(A) = \frac{0}{210} = 0
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(A \mid B) \)
Since \( P(A) = 0 \), we have:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0}{\frac{1}{5}} = 0
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won the game is \( 0 \). Therefore, \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \), and:
\[
m + n = 0 + 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"Given the rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) with the conditions that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, we need to find the length of \(CE\). Let's analyze the problem step by step.

First, note that since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(AB = CD = 107\) and \(BC = AD = 16\). Similarly, for rectangle \(EFGH\), \(EF = GH = 184\) and \(FG = EH = 17\).

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) must lie on the line \(DCF\). Also, since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, \(H\) must lie on the circle passing through \(A, D, G\).

To find the length of \(CE\), we need to use the fact that \(E\) lies on the line \(DCF\) and the properties of the rectangles and the circle. Since \(E\) is on the line \(DCF\), we can use the coordinates of the points to find the length of \(CE\).

Let's place the points in a coordinate system for simplicity. Assume \(D\) is at the origin \((0,0)\), \(C\) is at \((16,0)\), and \(F\) is at \((16,17)\). Since \(E\) is on the line \(DCF\), it must have coordinates \((x, y)\) such that \(y = \frac{17}{16}x\).

Now, we need to find the coordinates of \(E\) such that the distance \(CE\) is consistent with the given lengths. Since \(E\) is on the line \(DCF\), we can use the distance formula to find \(CE\).

The coordinates of \(E\) can be found by considering the properties of the rectangles and the circle. Since \(E\) is on the line \(DCF\), we can use the fact that the distance from \(C\) to \(E\) is the same as the distance from \(C\) to \(F\) scaled by the ratio of the sides of the rectangles.

Using the given lengths, we can calculate the length of \(CE\) as follows:
\[ CE = \sqrt{(16 - x)^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(16 - x)^2 + \left(\frac{17}{16}x\right)^2} \]

Since \(E\) is on the line \(DCF\), we can use the fact that the distance from \(C\) to \(E\) is the same as the distance from \(C\) to \(F\) scaled by the ratio of the sides of the rectangles. Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:
\[ CE = \sqrt{16^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{256 + 289} = \sqrt{545} \]

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]","[19, '19']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, while changing direction exactly 8 times, we need to analyze the structure of such paths.

A path of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. The path must start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, so it must consist of exactly 8 R's and 8 U's in some order. The problem specifies that the path changes direction exactly 8 times. A change of direction occurs whenever an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R. Therefore, the path must alternate between R and U moves.

There are two possible alternating patterns for the path:
1. Starting with R, the pattern is R, U, R, U, ..., R, U.
2. Starting with U, the pattern is U, R, U, R, ..., U, R.

In both cases, the path will consist of exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, and it will change direction exactly 8 times. The number of such paths is simply the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's in each of the two patterns.

For the first pattern (R, U, R, U, ..., R, U), the sequence is fixed as R, U, R, U, ..., R, U. There is only one way to arrange this sequence.

For the second pattern (U, R, U, R, ..., U, R), the sequence is also fixed as U, R, U, R, ..., U, R. There is only one way to arrange this sequence.

Therefore, there are exactly 2 paths that satisfy the given conditions.

"To find the largest possible value of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number such that \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplifying the second term, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + 24(1+1.5i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Let's denote \(75+117i\) by \(a\) and \(24(1+1.5i)\) by \(b\). Then the expression becomes:

\[
4ae^{i\theta} + be^{-i\theta}
\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[
4ae^{i\theta} + be^{-i\theta} = 4a(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + b(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = (4a + b)\cos\theta + i(4a - b)\sin\theta
\]

The magnitude of this complex number is:

\[
\sqrt{(4a + b)^2\cos^2\theta + (4a - b)^2\sin^2\theta}
\]

To maximize this magnitude, we need to maximize the expression inside the square root. Notice that the maximum value of the magnitude occurs when \(\cos^2\theta\) and \(\sin^2\theta\) are such that the terms are aligned in the same direction. This happens when \(\cos\theta = \pm 1\) and \(\sin\theta = 0\) or \(\cos\theta = 0\) and \(\sin\theta = \pm 1\).

Let's calculate the magnitude when \(\cos\theta = 1\) and \(\sin\theta = 0\):

\[
\sqrt{(4a + b)^2 + 0} = |4a + b|
\]

And when \(\cos\theta = 0\) and \(\sin\theta = 1\):

\[
\sqrt{0 + (4a - b)^2} = |4a - b|
\]

We need to calculate \(|4a + b|\) and \(|4a - b|\). First, we find \(4a + b\):

\[
4a + b = 4(75+117i) + 24(1+1.5i) = 300 + 468i + 24 + 36i = 324 + 504i
\]

The magnitude of \(324 + 504i\) is:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 504^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 254016} = \sqrt{359000} = 60\sqrt{99}
\]

Next, we find \(4a - b\):

\[
4a - b = 4(75+117i) - 24(1+1.5i) = 300 + 468i - 24 - 36i = 276 + 432i
\]

The magnitude of \(276 + 432i\) is:

\[
\sqrt{276^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{76176 + 186624} = \sqrt{262800} = 120\sqrt{17}
\]

Comparing \(60\sqrt{99}\) and \(120\sqrt{17}\), we see that \(60\sqrt{99} \approx 60 \times 9.95 = 597\) and \(120\sqrt{17} \approx 120 \times 4.12 = 494.4\). Therefore, the largest possible value is \(60\sqrt{99}\).

Thus, the largest possible value of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle \(ABC\). Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometry of the problem.

1. **Understanding the Configuration:**
   - We have 2024 circles of radius 1 that are tangent to the sides of triangle \(ABC\).
   - Two of these circles are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) respectively.
   - There are also 2022 circles tangent to the other sides of the triangle.

2. **Using the Given Information:**
   - The radius of the larger circles is 34.
   - The smaller circles have a radius of 1.

3. **Calculating the Distance Between Centers of Tangent Circles:**
   - The distance between the centers of two tangent circles is the sum of their radii.
   - For the larger circles tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\), the distance between their centers is \(34 + 1 = 35\).

4. **Using the Geometry of the Triangle:**
   - Let \(r\) be the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle \(ABC\).
   - The distance from the center of the inscribed circle to any side of the triangle is \(r\).

5. **Relating the Radii:**
   - The distance from the center of the inscribed circle to the sides of the triangle is \(r\).
   - The distance from the center of the larger circles to the sides of the triangle is \(34\).
   - The distance from the center of the smaller circles to the sides of the triangle is \(1\).

6. **Using the Tangency Condition:**
   - The distance between the centers of the larger circles and the inscribed circle is \(34 - r\).
   - The distance between the centers of the smaller circles and the inscribed circle is \(1 - r\).

7. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The total distance from the center of the inscribed circle to the sides of the triangle is the sum of the distances from the center of the inscribed circle to the sides of the triangle minus the radii of the larger and smaller circles.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     34 + 1 = r + 35
     \]

8. **Solving for \(r\):**
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     35 = r + 35
     \]
   - Subtracting 35 from both sides:
     \[
     r = 1

9. **Expressing \(r\) in the Form \(\frac{m}{n}\):**
   - The radius \(r\) is already in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 1\) and \(n = 1\).

First, recall that for a rectangle inscribed in a hyperbola, the diagonals are equal in length and intersect at the origin. This means that if \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), \(C = (x_3, y_3)\), and \(D = (x_4, y_4)\), then the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are equal in length and intersect at the origin. Therefore, the coordinates of the points can be written as \(A = (x, y)\), \(B = (-x, -y)\), \(C = (-x, y)\), and \(D = (x, -y)\).

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by the distance formula:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (-y - y)^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2} = 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\).

Since \(A = (x, y)\) lies on the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we can express \(x^2\) in terms of \(y^2\):
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} = 1 + \frac{y^2}{24} \implies x^2 = 20 \left(1 + \frac{y^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{20y^2}{24} = 20 + \frac{5y^2}{6}
\]
Substituting \(x^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(20 + \frac{5y^2}{6} + y^2\right) = 4\left(20 + \frac{5y^2 + 6y^2}{6}\right) = 4\left(20 + \frac{11y^2}{6}\right) = 80 + \frac{44y^2}{6} = 80 + \frac{22y^2}{3}
\]
To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to consider the range of \(y^2\). Since \(y^2\) can be any non-negative real number, the term \(\frac{22y^2}{3}\) can be arbitrarily large. However, we are asked to find the largest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rectangles. The minimum value of \(BD^2\) occurs when \(y^2 = 0\), which gives:

- \( B \): the set of students who can play a club.

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall that the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( OI \) as one leg and \( OA \) as the hypotenuse. The length of \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( OIA \):
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2
\]
\[
169 = 13 + IA^2
\]
\[
IA^2 = 156
\]
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) is the distance from the incenter \( I \) to the vertex \( A \). In a triangle, the product of the segments of the sides divided by the incenter is equal to the product of the other two sides divided by the inradius. Specifically, for vertex \( A \), we have:
\[
AB \cdot AC = (s - a) \cdot (s - c)
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and \( a \) and \( c \) are the sides opposite vertices \( B \) and \( C \), respectively. However, we can use another approach involving the area of the triangle. The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed in two ways:
\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin A = r \cdot s
\]
We also know that:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin A = r \cdot s
\]
\[

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product of the segments of the sides divided by the incenter is equal to the product of the other two sides divided by the inradius. Specifically, for vertex \( A \), we have:

"To solve for the number of triplets \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We are given that this expression equals 6,000,000, so we have:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]
Dividing through by 3, we get:
\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]

Now, let's consider the possible values for \(a, b,\) and \(c\). Since \(a, b,\) and \(c\) are non-negative integers and their sum is 300, one of them must be zero for the equation to hold. Let's assume \(c = 0\). Then the equations simplify to:
\[a + b = 300,\]
\[ab = 2,000,000.\]
We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy these equations. The quadratic equation whose roots are \(a\) and \(b\) is:
\[t^2 - 300t + 2,000,000 = 0.\]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
\[300^2 - 4 \cdot 2,000,000 = 90,000 - 8,000,000 = -7,910,000,\]
which is negative. Therefore, there are no real solutions for \(a\) and \(b\) when \(c = 0\).

Next, let's consider the case where two of the variables are zero. Without loss of generality, assume \(b = 0\) and \(c = 0\). Then the equations simplify to:
\[a = 300,\]
\[0 = 2,000,000,\]
which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions when two of the variables are zero.

Finally, let's consider the case where all three variables are non-zero. We need to find non-negative integers \(a, b,\) and \(c\) such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\). However, as we have already shown, the only possible solutions are when one of the variables is zero, and we have already determined that there are no solutions in that case.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) on segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not lie on any segment of \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\) are given as \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).

First, we parameterize the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). A point \(P\) on \(\overline{AB}\) can be written as:
\[
P = (1-t)A + tB = (1-t)\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) + t\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)
\]
for \(0 \leq t \leq 1\).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) does not lie on any segment of \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). The segments of \(\mathcal{F}\) are all unit segments with one endpoint on the \(x\)-axis and the other on the \(y\)-axis. The general form of such a segment is \(\overline{(a,0)(0,b)}\) where \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).

We need to find the value of \(t\) such that the point \(C = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)\) does not lie on any such segment. This means that \(\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2 \neq 1\).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = \frac{1}{4}(1 - 2t + t^2) + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}t^2 - \frac{1}{2}t + \frac{3}{4}t^2 = \frac{1}{4} + t^2 - \frac{1}{2}t + \frac{1}{4} = t^2 - \frac{1}{2}t + \frac{1}{2}
\]
We need this expression to be equal to 1:
\[
t^2 - \frac{1}{2}t + \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
2t^2 - t + 1 = 2
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
2t^2 - t - 1 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = -1\):
\[
t = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{4} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{4}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
t = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad t = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
Since \(t\) must be between 0 and 1, we discard \(t = -\frac{1}{2}\) and keep \(t = \frac{1}{2}\).

Substituting \(t = \frac{1}{2}\) back into the coordinates of \(C\), we get:
\[
C = \left(\frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)
\]
The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), and \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We will show that this product is divisible by 1000, which means it is divisible by both 8 and 125.

First, let's rewrite the product in a more convenient form. Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^0 = 1\), so \(\omega^{13+k} = \omega^k\). Therefore, the product can be written as:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})
\]

We can factor out the 2 from the first term in each factor:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}2(1-\omega^k+\frac{\omega^{2k}}{2})
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
2^{13} \prod_{k=0}^{12}(1-\omega^k+\frac{\omega^{2k}}{2})
\]

Next, we need to show that the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(1-\omega^k+\frac{\omega^{2k}}{2})\) is divisible by 125. To do this, we will use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) has roots \(\omega^k\) for \(k=0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial can be factored as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12})
\]

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(1-\omega^k+\frac{\omega^{2k}}{2})\). Notice that if we substitute \(x = 1\) into the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\), we get:
\[
1^{13} - 1 = 0
\]
This means that \(x-1\) is a factor of \(x^{13} - 1\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)Q(x)
\]
where \(Q(x)\) is a polynomial of degree 12. By the properties of roots of unity, we know that:
\[
Q(\omega^k) = \frac{\omega^{13k} - 1}{\omega^k - 1} = \frac{1 - 1}{\omega^k - 1} = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad k=1, 2, \ldots, 12
\]
This means that \(Q(x)\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
Q(x) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(x-\omega^k)
\]

Now, we need to evaluate \(Q(1)\):
\[
Q(1) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(1-\omega^k)
\]
We know that:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(1-\omega^k) = 13
\]
because the product of all 13th roots of unity is 13. Therefore:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12}(1-\omega^k) = \frac{13}{1-1} = 13
\]

Now, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(1-\omega^k+\frac{\omega^{2k}}{2})\). Notice that:
\[
1-\omega^k+\frac{\omega^{2k}}{2} = \frac{2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}}{2}
\]
Therefore:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(1-\omega^k+\frac{\omega^{2k}}{2}) = \frac{1}{2^{13}} \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})
\]

We need to show that \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divisible by 1000. Since \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(1-\omega^k+\frac{\omega^{2k}}{2})\) is divisible by 125, it follows that \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divisible by 1000.

Therefore, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is:

"To determine the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-elegant integers, we need to analyze the conditions for an integer \( n \) to be \( b \)-elegant. An integer \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant if it can be expressed in base \( b \) with exactly two digits, say \( \underline{a} \ \underline{b}_b \), and the sum of these digits \( a + b \) equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \):

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed by placing each side of the rectangle on either a side or a diagonal of a regular 12-gon, we need to consider the possible configurations of the sides of the rectangle.

A rectangle can be formed in two ways:
1. By placing two opposite sides on the sides of the 12-gon and the other two sides on the diagonals of the 12-gon.
2. By placing all four sides on the diagonals of the 12-gon.

### Case 1: Two opposite sides on the sides of the 12-gon and the other two sides on the diagonals of the 12-gon

For this case, we need to choose 2 out of the 12 sides of the 12-gon to be the opposite sides of the rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 sides out of 12 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{12}{2}\):

\[
\binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2 \times 1} = 66

### Case 2: All four sides on the diagonals of the 12-gon

For this case, we need to choose 4 vertices out of the 12 vertices of the 12-gon such that the diagonals form a rectangle. In a regular 12-gon, a rectangle is formed by choosing 4 vertices that are equally spaced around the 12-gon. This means we need to choose a starting vertex and then select every third vertex (since \(12/3 = 4\)). There are 12 possible starting vertices, but each rectangle is counted 4 times (once for each of its vertices), so we need to divide by 4:

\[
\frac{12}{4} = 3

### Total number of rectangles

Adding the number of rectangles from both cases, we get:

\[
66 + 3 = 69

Thus, the total number of rectangles that can be formed is \(\boxed{69}\).","[69, '69']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"Soit \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) laliste d'entiers positive. given the following conditions:
1. The sum of the elements is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is an integer that does not appear in the list.

First, since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's denote the number of times 9 appears by \( k \). Since 9 is the unique mode, all other numbers must appear fewer than \( k \) times. Let's assume \( k = 2 \) (if \( k \) were greater, the sum would exceed 30). This means 9 appears twice, and the rest of the numbers must be different from 9 and must appear at most once each.

Let's denote the rest of the numbers by \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m \) where \( a_i \neq 9 \) and \( a_i \neq a_j \) for \( i \neq j \). The sum of all the elements is 30, so we have:
\[ 9 + 9 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m = 30 \]
\[ 18 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m = 30 \]
\[ a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m = 12 \]

Since the median is an integer that does not appear in the list, and since 9 is the mode and appears twice, the median must be one of the other numbers. The simplest case is that the median is the smallest number in the list, which must be less than 9. Let's assume the median is 6 (the next smallest number less than 9). This means the list has an odd number of elements, and the median is the middle element when the list is ordered. If the list has 5 elements, the median is the third element. So, the list could be:
\[ a_1, a_2, 6, 9, 9 \]
where \( a_1 + a_2 = 12 - 6 = 6 \). The simplest solution is \( a_1 = 3 \) and \( a_2 = 3 \), but since all numbers must be different, we need to find another combination. The next simplest is \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 5 \). So, the list is:
\[ 1, 5, 6, 9, 9 \]
The sum is \( 1 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 30 \), and the median is 6, which is not 9. This list satisfies all the conditions.

Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of all the elements in the list:

We can start by expressing \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[d = 99 - a\]
\[e = 99 - b\]
\[f = 99 - c\]

Substituting these into the row sums, we get:
\[a + b + c = 999\]
\[d + e + f = (99 - a) + (99 - b) + (99 - c) = 297 - (a + b + c) = 297 - 999 = -702\]

This is a contradiction because we know \(d + e + f = 999\). Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's try a different method by considering the possibility that the numbers are not necessarily single digits but can be multi-digit numbers.

Let's try the example given in the problem:
\[

2. \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\)
3. \(8 + 9 = 17\)
4. \(9 + 9 = 18\)
5. \(81 + 1 = 82\)

This example does not satisfy the conditions. Let's try another approach by considering the possibility that the numbers are not necessarily single digits but can be multi-digit numbers.

After further analysis, we find that the correct arrangement is:
\[

2. \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\)
3. \(8 + 9 = 17\)
4. \(9 + 9 = 18\)
5. \(81 + 1 = 82\)

After further analysis, we find that the correct arrangement is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

From these equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other. First, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{(xyz)^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12} = 2^{13/12}
\]

So we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\). First, we simplify the expression inside the logarithm:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (xyz)^4 \cdot \frac{y^3}{x} \cdot \frac{z^2}{y^2} = (xyz)^4 \cdot y \cdot z = (2^{-13/12})^4 \cdot yz = 2^{-13/3} \cdot yz
\]

Since \(yz = \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\), we substitute \(yz\) back into the expression:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-13/3} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} = 2^{-13/3} \cdot 2^{-1/2} \cdot x = 2^{-13/3 - 1/2} \cdot x = 2^{-13/3 - 3/6} \cdot x = 2^{-26/6 - 3/6} \cdot x = 2^{-29/6} \cdot x
\]

Since \(x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{-13/12} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{-13/12} = 2^{6/12 - 13/12} = 2^{-7/12}\), we substitute \(x\) back into the expression:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-29/6} \cdot 2^{-7/12} = 2^{-29/6 - 7/12} = 2^{-58/12 - 7/12} = 2^{-65/12}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-65/12}) = -\frac{65}{12}
\]

The absolute value is:

\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| -\frac{65}{12} \right| = \frac{65}{12}
\]

Thus, \(m = 65\) and \(n = 12\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:

\[
m + n = 65 + 12 = 77
\]

"To solve for the side length of the regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\), we start by understanding the geometric properties of the hexagon and the triangle formed by extending its opposite sides.

Given that the hexagon is equilateral and all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, we can infer that the hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids by a line passing through its center. Let the side length of the hexagon be \(s\).

When we extend the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) to form a triangle, the lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. These sides are parallel to the sides of the hexagon and are each equal to the sum of two sides of the hexagon, i.e., \(2s\).

Thus, we can set up the following equations based on the given side lengths of the triangle:
\[2s = 200\]
\[2s = 240\]
\[2s = 300\]

However, since the hexagon is equilateral and all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the side length \(s\) must be the same for all sides of the hexagon. Therefore, we need to find a consistent value for \(s\) that fits all three equations. The only way this can be true is if the side length \(s\) is the average of the three given side lengths of the triangle divided by 2.

So, we calculate the average of 200, 240, and 300:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = \frac{740}{3} = 246.67
\]
Then, we divide this average by 2 to find the side length of the hexagon:
\[
s = \frac{246.67}{2} = 123.33
\]

However, since the problem involves integer side lengths, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints. Given the problem's context and the need for integer solutions, we can infer that the side length of the hexagon is the consistent value that fits all conditions, which is the average divided by 2.

Thus, the side length of the hexagon is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the sets \( B \) that Bob consider. Each set \( B \) is a non-empty finite set of positive integers, and the maximum element of \( B \) must be in the set \( A \). Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_k \).

For each \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), the set \( B \) can include any subset of the elements \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i - 1\} \) along with the element \( a_i \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i - 1} \). Therefore, the total number of possible sets \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets for each possible maximum element in \( A \):

\[
2^{a_1 - 1} + 2^{a_2 - 1} + \cdots + 2^{a_k - 1} = 2024
\]

We need to find a set \( A \) such that the sum of these powers of 2 equals 2024. Notice that 2024 in binary is 11111101100, which can be expressed as:

\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^2
\]

This means that the elements of \( A \) are \( 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 3, 2 \). Therefore, the set \( A \) is \( \{2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
2 + 3 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 56

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number that is divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( \overline{abcd} \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits.

First, let's express \( N \) in terms of its digits:
\[ N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \]

We need to check the condition for each digit:
1. Changing \( a \) to 1: \( 1000 \cdot 1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)
2. Changing \( b \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100 \cdot 1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \)
3. Change \( c \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10 \cdot 1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \)
4. Change \( d \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7. Let's start by checking the divisibility conditions.

### Step 1: Check divisibility by 7 for each case
1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

2. \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 1000a \equiv 6a \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 1000a \equiv 6a \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 100b \equiv 2b \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
   \[ 1000a \equiv 6a \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 100b \equiv 2b \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 10c \equiv 3c \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
   \[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

### Step 2: Solve the system of congruences
We have the following system of congruences:
1. \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)

We can solve this system step by step. First, let's subtract the second congruence from the first:
\[ (2b + 3c + d) - (6a + 3c + d) \equiv 1 - 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b - 6a \equiv -4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b - 6a \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b \equiv 6a + 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 3a + 5 \pmod{7} \]

Next, subtract the third congruence from the second:
\[ (6a + 3c + d) - (6a + 2b + d) \equiv 5 - 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c - 2b \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c \equiv 2b + 1 \pmod{7} \]

Substitute \( b \equiv 3a + 5 \pmod{7} \) into the equation:
\[ 3c \equiv 2(3a + 5) + 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c \equiv 6a + 10 + 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c \equiv 6a + 11 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c \equiv 6a + 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 2a + 2 \pmod{7} \]

Now substitute \( b \equiv 3a + 5 \pmod{7} \) and \( c \equiv 2a + 2 \pmod{7} \) into the fourth congruence:
\[ 6a + 2(3a + 5) + 3(2a + 2) \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 6a + 10 + 6a + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 18a + 16 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 4a + 2 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 4a \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ a \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Thus, \( a = 1 \). Substitute \( a = 1 \) back to find \( b \) and \( c \):
\[ b \equiv 3(1) + 5 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 2(1) + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

Finally, substitute \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 4 \) into the first congruence to find \( d \):
\[ 2(1) + 3(4) + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2 + 12 + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 14 + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 1 - 14 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv -13 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Thus, \( d = 1 \). Therefore, the number \( N \) is:
\[ N = 1000(1) + 100(1) + 10(4) + 1 = 1141 \]

### Step 3: Find \( Q \) and \( R \)
When \( N = 1141 \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 1 and the remainder \( R \) is 141. Therefore:
\[ Q = 1 \]
\[ R = 141 \]

### Step 4: Calculate \( Q + R \)
\[ Q + R = 1 + 141 = 142 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the circle \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it is external to \( S \). The difference \( r_i - r_o \) will be expressed in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \), and we need to find \( m + n \).

First, let's analyze the geometry of the problem. The circle \( T \) has a radius of 3, and the sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11. The distance from the center of the circle \( T \) to the center of the sphere \( S \) is 6.

When the circle \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) externally, the distance from the center of the circle \( T \) to the point of tangency on the sphere \( S \) is the sum of the radii of the circle \( T \) and the sphere \( S \), which is \( 3 + 11 = 14 \).

Now, consider the right triangle formed by the center of the circle \( T \), the center of the sphere \( S \), and the point of tangency on the sphere \( S \). The hypotenuse of this right triangle is 14, one leg is 6 (the distance from the center of the circle \( T \) to the center of the sphere \( S \)), and the other leg is the radius of the circle \( T \) plus the radius of the sphere \( S \) minus the radius of the circle \( T \), which is 11.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the radius \( r_i \) of the circle along which the circle \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it is external to \( S \):
\[
r_i = 14 - 11 = 3
\]

Next, consider the case when the circle \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) internally. The distance from the center of the circle \( T \) to the point of tangency on the sphere \( S \) is the difference between the radius of the sphere \( S \) and the radius of the circle \( T \), which is \( 11 - 3 = 8 \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem again, we can find the radius \( r_o \) of the circle along which the circle \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it is internal to \( S \):
\[
r_o = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 14 - 8 = 6
\]

Thus, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) can be expressed as \( \frac{6}{1} \), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \).
