"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( s \) and \( t \) based on the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the conditions:**
   - The number of sides of the polygon is \( s + \frac{1}{2} \).
   - The number of diagonals in the polygon is \( t \).

"Given the triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we need to find the length of \(AP\) where \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) with the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\).

First, we use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio in which the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) divides \(BC\). The theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the other two sides. Therefore, the ratio \(BP:PC = AB:AC = 5:10 = 1:2\).

Next, we use the fact that \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) with the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\). This means that \(P\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) that does not contain \(A\). Therefore, \(P\) is the point where the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) intersects the circumcircle again, and \(AP\) is the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle.

By the properties of the circumcircle and the angle bisector, we know that \(AP\) is the same as the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, which is given by the formula for the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(AP\) is the same as the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, which is given by the formula for the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle.

Using the formula for the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, we have:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( m+n \) where \( \frac{m}{n} \) is the ratio of the number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 lines to the number of ways to choose 2 lines from 9 lines. Let's break this down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 lines. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{2} \):
\[
\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45

Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 lines from 9 lines. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{9}{2} \):
\[
\binom{9}{2} = \frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = \frac{9 \times 8}{2 \times 1} = 36

The ratio of the number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 lines to the number of ways to choose 2 lines from 9 lines is:

"To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then use them to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the given equations.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

We need to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equations:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Let's start by analyzing \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( x \geq 0 \), then \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| \).
  - If \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2} \).
  - If \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - x \).
- If \( x < 0 \), then \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{2} \right| \).
  - If \( x \leq -\frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = -x - \frac{1}{2} \).
  - If \( -\frac{1}{2} < x < 0 \), then \( f(x) = x + \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( x \geq 0 \), then \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| \).
  - If \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \).
  - If \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \).
- If \( x < 0 \), then \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| x + \frac{1}{4} \right| \).
  - If \( x \leq -\frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = -x - \frac{1}{4} \).
  - If \( -\frac{1}{4} < x < 0 \), then \( g(x) = x + \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Solve the equations
We need to find \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Let's start with the first equation:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]

Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the values of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- If \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq 0 \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \right| \).
  - If \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \).
  - If \( 0 \leq \sin(2\pi x) < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - \sin(2\pi x) \).
- If \( \sin(2\pi x) < 0 \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| \sin(2\pi x) + \frac{1}{2} \right| \).
  - If \( \sin(2\pi x) \leq -\frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = -\sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \).
  - If \( -\frac{1}{2} < \sin(2\pi x) < 0 \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \sin(2\pi x) + \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, let's consider the second equation:
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the values of \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- If \( \cos(3\pi y) \geq 0 \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| \cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \right| \).
  - If \( \cos(3\pi y) \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \).
  - If \( 0 \leq \cos(3\pi y) < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - \cos(3\pi y) \).
- If \( \cos(3\pi y) < 0 \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| \cos(3\pi y) + \frac{1}{2} \right| \).
  - If \( \cos(3\pi y) \leq -\frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = -\cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \).
  - If \( -\frac{1}{2} < \cos(3\pi y) < 0 \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \cos(3\pi y) + \frac{1}{2} \).

By analyzing the equations and the ranges of the trigonometric functions, we find that the only solution that satisfies both equations is:
\[ x = 0 \]
\[ y = 0 \]

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( m \) in terms of \( n \) such that the number of divisors of \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \) are equal, and both are divisible by \( p^2 \) where \( p \) is a prime number.

First, let's analyze the number of divisors of \( n^4 + 1 \). The number of divisors of a number \( N \) with prime factorization \( N = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \) is given by \( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) \). For \( n^4 + 1 \) to have a number of divisors that is a perfect square, the exponents in its prime factorization must be such that each exponent plus one is a perfect square. This means that each exponent in the prime factorization of \( n^4 + 1 \) must be one less than a perfect square.

Similarly, for \( m^4 + 1 \) to have the same number of divisors, the exponents in its prime factorization must also be one less than a perfect square. Since the number of divisors is the same for both \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \), and both are divisible by \( p^2 \), it implies that \( n \) and \( m \) must be related in such a way that the structure of their prime factorizations is similar.

Given that \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \) have the same number of divisors and are both divisible by \( p^2 \), the simplest and most direct relationship between \( n \) and \( m \) is that \( m = n \). This is because if \( n \) and \( m \) are the same, then \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \) are identical, and thus have the same number of divisors.

Therefore, the value of \( m \) in terms of \( n \) is:

x_1^2 + y_1^2 = 41,
\]
\[
x_2^2 + y_2^2 = 80,
\]
\[
(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = 89.
\]
Similarly, for \(D\), we have:
\[
x_3^2 + y_3^2 = 41,
\]
\[
x_3^2 + y_3^2 = 80,
\]
\[
(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 = 89.
\]
By symmetry and the properties of the quadrilateral, we can assume that \(A\) and \(C\) are symmetric with respect to the center of the quadrilateral, and \(B\) and \(D\) are symmetric with respect to the center. Therefore, the center of the quadrilateral is the midpoint of the diagonals, and the coordinates of the center \(O\) are \(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_3}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_3}{2}\right)\).

The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at the center \(O\), so the coordinates of \(I\) are \(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_3}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_3}{2}\right)\). The reflection of \(I\) across the center \(O\) is the same point \(I\), so the length of the segment \(II'\) is zero.

However, the problem asks for the length of the segment \(II'\) in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\). Since the length is zero, we can express it as \(\frac{0 \sqrt{1}}{1}\), so \(m = 0\), \(n = 1\), and \(p = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2\).

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( p + q \) where \( r^2 = \frac{p}{q} \) and \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. We start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the roots of the quadratic equation.

The quadratic equation is given by:
\[ x^2 - 54x + 23 = 0 \]

Let the roots of this equation be \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \). By Vieta's formulas, we know:
\[ \alpha + \beta = 54 \]
\[ \alpha \beta = 23 \]

We are asked to find the value of \( r^2 \), where \( r \) is the sum of the squares of the roots. The sum of the squares of the roots can be expressed as:
\[ \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 2\alpha\beta \]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas:
\[ \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 54^2 - 2 \cdot 23 \]
\[ \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 2916 - 46 \]
\[ \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 2870 \]

Thus, \( r^2 = 2870 \). We need to express \( 2870 \) as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. Since \( 2870 \) is already an integer, we can write:
\[ 2870 = \frac{2870}{1} \]

Here, \( p = 2870 \) and \( q = 1 \). Since \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, we have:
\[ p + q = 2870 + 1 = 2871 \]

Therefore, the value of \( p + q \) is:

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the value of \(xy\).

First, let's simplify the given logarithmic equations.

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
   Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we get:
   \[
   x \log_x(y) = 10
   \]
   Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \implies x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \implies \log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
   \]

2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)
   Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we get:
   \[
   4y \log_y(x) = 10
   \]
   Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10 \implies 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \implies \log(y) = \frac{4y \log(x)}{10} = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
   \]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log(y)\):
\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log(y) = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\log(y)\), we get:
\[
\frac{10 \log(x)}{x} = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
\]
Assuming \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can cancel \(\log(x)\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]
Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the number of ways to choose \( n \) items from 2024 items is maximized. This is equivalent to finding the value of \( n \) that maximizes the binomial coefficient \( \binom{2024}{n} \).

The binomial coefficient \( \binom{2024}{n} \) is maximized when \( n \) is as close as possible to \( \frac{2024}{2} = 1012 \). This is because the binomial coefficients are symmetric and reach their maximum in the middle of the range from 0 to 2024.

To confirm, we can check the values of \( \binom{2024}{1011} \), \( \binom{2024}{1012} \), and \( \binom{2024}{1013} \). Since the binomial coefficients are symmetric, \( \binom{2024}{1011} = \binom{2024}{1013} \) and \( \binom{2024}{1012} \) is the maximum.

Therefore, the value of \( n \) that maximizes the number of ways to choose \( n \) items from 2024 items is \( n = 1012 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen 4-element subset of the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \) contains at least one of the elements 1, 2, 3, or 4. We will use the principle of complementary counting to find this probability.

First, we calculate the total number of 4-element subsets of \( S \). This is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we calculate the number of 4-element subsets that do not contain any of the elements 1, 2, 3, or 4. This is equivalent to choosing 4 elements from the set \( \{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\} \), which has 6 elements. The number of such subsets is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15
\]

The number of 4-element subsets that contain at least one of the elements 1, 2, 3, or 4 is the total number of 4-element subsets minus the number of 4-element subsets that do not contain any of these elements:
\[
210 - 15 = 195
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen 4-element subset contains at least one of the elements 1, 2, 3, or 4 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:
\[

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{13}{14}\), and the sum of the numerator and the denominator is:

- \(B = (107, 0)\)
- \(C = (107 + 16, h) = (123, h)\)
- \(D = (x, y)\)

Since \(E, F, G, H\) are collinear with \(A, D, H, G\) and \(B, C, E, F\), we can use the properties of similar triangles and the given lengths to find the coordinates of \(E, F, G, H\).

The length of \(EF\) is given as 184, and since \(E\) and \(F\) are on \(AB\) and \(BC\) respectively, we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(F\) are collinear with \(B\) and \(C\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word "" mango "" such that the two 'm's are not next to each other. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of arrangements of the letters in "" mango "" without any restrictions.**

   The word "" mango "" consists of 5 distinct letters. The total number of arrangements of these letters is given by the factorial of the number of letters:
   \[
   5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120

2. **Calculate the number of arrangements where the two 'm's are next to each other.**

"Given the equation \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = 0\), we need to find the value of \(z\) such that \(|z| = 4\).

First, let's rewrite the equation:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = 0
\]
Multiply both sides by \(z\) to clear the fraction:
\[
(75+117i)z^2 + 96+144i = 0
\]
Rearrange the equation to isolate the term involving \(z^2\):
\[
(75+117i)z^2 = -96-144i
\]
Divide both sides by \(75+117i\):
\[
z^2 = \frac{-96-144i}{75+117i}
\]
To simplify the right-hand side, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
\[
z^2 = \frac{(-96-144i)(75-117i)}{(75+117i)(75-117i)}
\]
Calculate the denominator:
\[
(75+117i)(75-117i) = 75^2 - (117i)^2 = 5625 + 13689 = 19314
\]
Calculate the numerator:
\[
(-96-144i)(75-117i) = -96 \cdot 75 + 96 \cdot 117i - 144i \cdot 75 + 144i \cdot 117i = -7200 + 11328i - 10800i - 16848 = -24088 - 1472i
\]
So we have:
\[
z^2 = \frac{-24088 - 1472i}{19314} = \frac{-24088}{19314} + \frac{-1472i}{19314} = -\frac{12044}{9657} - \frac{736i}{9657}
\]
Now, we need to find the magnitude of \(z^2\):
\[
|z^2| = \left| -\frac{12044}{9657} - \frac{736i}{9657} \right| = \sqrt{\left( -\frac{12044}{9657} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{736}{9657} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{12044^2 + 736^2}{9657^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{12044^2 + 736^2}}{9657}
\]
Calculate the numerator:
\[
12044^2 + 736^2 = 144977936 + 541696 = 145519632
\]
So:
\[
|z^2| = \frac{\sqrt{145519632}}{9657} = \frac{12063}{9657} = 1.25

Since \(|z^2| = |z|^2\) and we know \(|z| = 4\), we have:
\[
|z^2| = 4^2 = 16

First, let's recall that the area of triangle \(PQR\) (the intouch triangle) is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle PQR = \frac{r^2}{2R} \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC
\]
where \(r\) is the inradius and \(R\) is the circumradius of triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is denoted as \(\Delta\). The area of triangle \(PQR\) can be expressed as:
\[

The ratio of the area of triangle \(ABC\) to the area of triangle \(PQR\) is:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of } \triangle ABC}{\text{Area of } \triangle PQR} = \frac{\Delta}{\frac{r^2}{2R} \times \Delta} = \frac{2R}{r^2}
\]

However, we need to use another approach to find the ratio of the areas. The area of triangle \(PQR\) can also be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter \(s\) and the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle PQR = \frac{r^2}{2R} \times \Delta = \frac{r^2}{2R} \times s \times r = \frac{r^3 s}{2R}
\]

The ratio of the area of triangle \(ABC\) to the area of triangle \(PQR\) is:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of } \triangle ABC}{\text{Area of } \triangle PQR} = \frac{s \times r}{\frac{r^3 s}{2R}} = \frac{2R}{r}
\]

For a triangle, the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the intouch triangle is always 2. Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle \(ABC\) to the area of triangle \(PQR\) is 2. This means:

\frac{m}{n} = 2 = \frac{2}{1}

"Given the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( O \) as the circumcenter and \( I \) as the incenter, we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). This implies that \( \angle OAI = 90^\circ \). We are also given that the lengths of the tangents from \( B \) and \( C \) to the incircle are 13 and 6 respectively. Let's denote the semiperimeter of the triangle by \( s \) and the inradius by \( r \). The lengths of the tangents from the vertices to the points of tangency with the incircle are given by \( s - a \), \( s - b \), and \( s - c \), where \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), and \( c = AB \).

Since the tangents from \( B \) and \( C \) to the incircle are 13 and 6 respectively, we have:
\[ s - c = 13 \]
\[ s - b = 6 \]

Adding these two equations, we get:

\[ 2s - (b + c) = 19 \]
\[ 2s - (2s - a) = 19 \]

Now, we need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \), which is \( bc \). Using the semiperimeter \( s \), we have:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{19 + b + c}{2} \]

From the equations \( s - c = 13 \) and \( s - b = 6 \), we can express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of \( s \):

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We know from the problem statement that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]
So, we can substitute this into the equation:
\[6,000,000 = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]
To find \(abc\), we need to determine the value of \(ab + bc + ca\). However, we can use the fact that the equation must hold true for some values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy \(a + b + c = 300\). Let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then:
\[a + a + a = 300 \implies 3a = 300 \implies a = 100.\]

Since \(C\) lies on both \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{OC}\), the coordinates of \(C\) must satisfy both parameterizations. Let \(C = (x, y)\). Then, we have:
\[
x = \frac{1}{2}(1-t) \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t.
\]
Since \(C\) is also on the line \(\overline{OC}\), the coordinates of \(C\) must be of the form \((x, y) = (x, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x)\). Equating the two expressions for \(y\), we get:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t \implies x = t.
\]
Substituting \(x = t\) into the expression for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{1}{2}(1-x) \implies 2x = 1 - x \implies 3x = 1 \implies x = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \right)\). The distance \(OC\) is given by:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{9} + \frac{3}{36}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{12}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{36} + \frac{3}{36}} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{6}.
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{7}}{6} \right)^2 = \frac{7}{36}\). Here, \(p = 7\) and \(q = 36\), so \(p + q = 7 + 36 = 43\). The answer is:

\boxed{43}.

"To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. This means \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

We can factor this expression by considering the polynomial whose roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), and the roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We can express the polynomial as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).\]

Now, let's consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) and its derivative \(P'(x) = 13x^{12}\). By the properties of roots of unity, we know that:
\[P'(\omega^k) = 13(\omega^k)^{12} = 13 \omega^{-1} = 13 \omega^{12}.\]

The polynomial \(P(x)\) can be factored as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)Q(x),\]
where \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The derivative of \(Q(x)\) is:
\[Q'(x) = 12x^{11} + 11x^{10} + \cdots + 2x + 1.\]

By the product rule, we have:
\[P'(x) = Q(x) + xQ'(x).\]
Evaluating at \(x = \omega^k\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\), we get:
\[P'(\omega^k) = Q(\omega^k) + \omega^k Q'(\omega^k) = 13 \omega^{12}.\]
Since \(Q(\omega^k) = 0\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) (because \(\omega^k\) are roots of \(Q(x)\)), we have:
\[13 \omega^{12} = \omega^k Q'(\omega^k).\]
Thus,
\[Q'(\omega^k) = 13 \omega^{-1} = 13 \omega^{12}.\]

Now, we need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]
Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). Therefore, the product becomes:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) has roots \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial \(2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at these roots gives us the product we need. By properties of roots of unity and symmetric functions, the product of these terms is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \(P(x)\) evaluated at \(x = 2\), which is:
\[P(2) = 2^{13} - 1 = 8191.\]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of pages in a book and the number of words in those pages. The problem states that the number of pages in the book is \( n \) and the number of words in those pages is \( 81 \). The number of words per page is given by the expression \( 63_{13} \), which is a number in base 13. We need to convert this number from base 13 to base 10 and then find the sum of its digits.

First, let's convert \( 63_{13} \) to base 10. The number \( 63_{13} \) means:
\[ 6 \cdot 13^1 + 3 \cdot 13^0 = 6 \cdot 13 + 3 \cdot 1 = 78 + 3 = 81. \]
So, \( 63_{13} = 81_{10} \).

Next, we need to find the sum of the digits of \( 81 \). The digits of \( 81 \) are \( 8 \) and \( 1 \), so the sum of the digits is:
\[ 8 + 1 = 9. \]

The problem also states that the sum of the digits of \( 81 \) is equal to \( \sqrt{81} \). Since \( \sqrt{81} = 9 \), this confirms our calculation.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sides of the polygon formed by connecting the vertices of a regular 12-gon that are 4 vertices apart. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a regular 12-gon (dodecagon).
   - We connect every 4th vertex to form a new polygon.
   - We need to find the number of sides of this new polygon.

2. **Visualizing the Process:**
   - Label the vertices of the 12-gon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \).
   - To form the new polygon, we connect \( A_1 \) to \( A_5 \), \( A_5 \) to \( A_9 \), \( A_9 \) to \( A_1 \), and so on.

3. **Identifying the Pattern:**
   - The vertices of the new polygon are \( A_1, A_5, A_9, A_{13}, A_{17}, \ldots \).
   - Since the indices are taken modulo 12, we need to find the smallest \( k \) such that \( 1 + 4k \equiv 1 \pmod{12} \).

4. **Solving the Congruence:**
   - We need \( 4k \equiv 0 \pmod{12} \).
   - The smallest \( k \) that satisfies this is \( k = 3 \) because \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \equiv 0 \pmod{12} \).

5. **Counting the Vertices:**
   - The vertices of the new polygon are \( A_1, A_5, A_9, A_{13} \equiv A_1, A_{17} \equiv A_5, \ldots \).
   - This pattern repeats every 3 steps, so the new polygon has 3 vertices.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The new polygon formed by connecting every 4th vertex of a regular 12-gon is a regular 3-gon (equilateral triangle).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sides of the polygon given the information about the interior angles. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The polygon has 30 sides.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
     \]
   - The polygon has 9 sides with each interior angle being \( 120^\circ \).

2. **Sum of Interior Angles for 9 Sides:**
   - For a polygon with 9 sides:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (9-2) \times 180^\circ = 7 \times 180^\circ = 1260^\circ
     \]
   - Since each of these 9 angles is \( 120^\circ \):
     \[
     9 \times 120^\circ = 1080^\circ
     \]
   - This indicates there is a discrepancy because the sum of the interior angles should be 1260°, not 1080°. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a need to re-evaluate the given information.

3. **Re-evaluating the Problem:**
   - Given the discrepancy, let's assume the problem is asking about the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with 30 sides and 9 sides with each interior angle being \( 120^\circ \).

4. **Sum of Interior Angles for 30 Sides:**
   - For a polygon with 30 sides:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (30-2) \times 180^\circ = 28 \times 180^\circ = 5040^\circ
     \]

5. **Sum of Interior Angles for 9 Sides:**
   - For a polygon with 9 sides:
     \[
     \text{Sum of interior angles} = (9-2) \times 180^\circ = 7 \times 180^\circ = 1260^\circ
     \]

6. **Finding the Number of Sides:**
   - We need to find the number of sides \( n \) such that the sum of the interior angles is 5040°.
   - Using the formula:
     \[
     (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 5040^\circ
     \]
   - Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     n-2 = \frac{5040^\circ}{180^\circ} = 28

     n = 28 + 2 = 30

"To solve the problem, we need to fill in the grid with the digits 0 through 9 such that the sum of the digits in each row and each column is 9. Let's denote the grid as follows:

\]
we can rewrite these equations in exponential form:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}, \quad \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}, \quad \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}

From these, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:
\[
x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}, \quad y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}, \quad z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]
To eliminate the variables, we multiply all three equations together:
\[
x \cdot y \cdot z = (yz \cdot \sqrt{2}) \cdot (xz \cdot 2^{1/3}) \cdot (xy \cdot 2^{1/4})
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
xyz = x^2 y^2 z^2 \cdot 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}

Since \(x, y, z \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x^2 y^2 z^2\):
\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}

The exponent on the right-hand side can be simplified:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}

\]
Since \(y^2 z = \frac{y^3 z^2}{z} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{z} = 2^{1/3} \cdot \frac{1}{z} = 2^{1/3} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{-13/12} \cdot x} = 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{13/12} \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 2^{17/12} \cdot \frac{1}{x}\), we have:
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-13/3} \cdot 2^{17/12} \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 2^{-13/3 + 17/12} \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 2^{-5/12} \cdot \frac{1}{x}
\]
Since \(x = 2^{-1/2} \cdot yz = 2^{-1/2} \cdot 2^{13/12} = 2^{1/12}\), we have:
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus, \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| \log_2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \right| = \left| -1 \right| = 1\). Therefore, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 1\), so \(m+n = 2\).

Therefore, we can conclude that the sum of the lengths of the sides is 200 + 240 + 300 = 740, but since each side is counted three times, the actual sum of the lengths of the sides is \( \frac{740}{3} = 246.67 \), which is not possible since the lengths must be integers. This suggests that the problem might have a different interpretation or there might be a typo. However, if we assume the problem meant the sum of the lengths of the sides is the same for each set, then we can use the average of the three sums to find the actual sum of the lengths of the sides. The average is \( \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = 246.67 \), but since the lengths must be integers, we can assume the actual sum is 240 (the closest integer to the average).

Given that the sum of the lengths of the sides is 240, we can assume the hexagon is regular, meaning all sides are equal. Therefore, each side of the hexagon is \( \frac{240}{6} = 40 \).

Now, we need to find the area of the hexagon. The area \(A\) of a regular hexagon with side length \(s\) is given by the formula:
\[ A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 \]
Substituting \(s = 40\):
\[ A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 40^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 1600 = 2400\sqrt{3} \]

Therefore, the area of the hexagon is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""A"" and ""B"" such that the number of A's is equal to the number of B's. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of letters and the condition:**
   - The word consists of 2024 letters.
   - The number of A's must be equal to the number of B's.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of A's.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of B's (since the number of A's is equal to the number of B's).
   - Therefore, the total number of letters is \( 2n = 2024 \).

3. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   2n = 2024
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{2024}{2} = 1012
   \]
   So, there are 1012 A's and 1012 B's.

4. **Calculate the number of distinct arrangements:**
   - The number of distinct arrangements of 1012 A's and 1012 B's is given by the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{2024}{1012}
   \]
   This represents the number of ways to choose 1012 positions out of 2024 for the A's (the remaining 1012 positions will automatically be for the B's).

5. **Final answer:**
   The number of ways to arrange the letters in the word such that the number of A's is equal to the number of B's is:
   \[
   \boxed{\binom{2024}{1012}}

"Given the problem, we need to determine the values of \(N\) and \(Q\) and then find \(Q + R\) where \(R\) is the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000. Additionally, we need to find the remainder when \(Q\) is divided by 1000.

First, let's understand the constraints and the problem statement. The number of places \(N\) is such that it is less than 1000 and when divided by 1000, the remainder is \(R\). This means \(N\) can be written as:
\[ N = 1000k + R \]
where \(k\) is an integer and \(0 \leq R < 1000\).

Since \(N\) is less than 1000, the only possible value for \(k\) is 0. Therefore, \(N = R\).

Next, we need to find the value of \(Q\). The problem states that \(Q\) is the number of places in \(N\) and \(N\) is a 3-digit number. Since \(N\) is a 3-digit number, \(Q = 3\).

Now, we need to find the remainder when \(Q\) is divided by 1000. Since \(Q = 3\), the remainder when 3 is divided by 1000 is 3. Therefore, \(R = 3\).

Finally, we need to find \(Q + R\):
\[ Q + R = 3 + 3 = 6 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers, and then find \( m+n \).

First, let's analyze the given information:
- The ratio of the radii of the two circles is \( \frac{r_i}{r_o} \).
- The ratio of the radii of the two circles is given by \( \frac{r_i - r_o}{r_o} = \frac{m}{n} \).

We can rewrite this ratio as:
\[
\frac{r_i - r_o}{r_o} = \frac{m}{n}
\]

This implies:
\[
r_i - r_o = \frac{m}{n} r_o
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
r_i = r_o + \frac{m}{n} r_o
\]

Factoring out \( r_o \) on the right-hand side:
\[
r_i = r_o \left(1 + \frac{m}{n}\right)
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
r_i = r_o \left(\frac{n + m}{n}\right)
\]

Thus, the ratio of the radii is:
\[
\frac{r_i}{r_o} = \frac{n + m}{n}
\]

Given that \( \frac{r_i}{r_o} = \frac{m}{n} \), we equate the two expressions:
\[
\frac{n + m}{n} = \frac{m}{n}
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:
\[
n + m = m
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
n = 0
\]

However, this is not possible since \( n \) must be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Given the problem's context, we should consider the geometric properties of the circles and their tangency. The correct approach involves using the properties of similar triangles formed by the radii and the tangency points.

Let's consider the correct geometric configuration:
- The ratio of the radii \( \frac{r_i}{r_o} \) is given by the ratio of the segments formed by the tangency points on the circles.

Using the properties of similar triangles, we find:
\[
\frac{r_i}{r_o} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

This ratio is known as the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \).

Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{r_i - r_o}{r_o} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1 = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}
\]

Here, \( m = \sqrt{5} - 1 \) and \( n = 2 \).

Since \( m \) and \( n \) must be integers, we rationalize the expression:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}
\]

Thus, the correct ratio is:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}}
\]

Finally, we find:
\[
m = 1, \quad n = 2
\]

Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 2 = 3 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the pattern and the constraints given in the problem. The problem states that there are 25 places to fill with the numbers 1 through 25, and the sum of the numbers in each row and each column must be the same. This is a classic problem of constructing a magic square.

A 5x5 magic square is a 5x5 grid filled with the numbers 1 through 25 such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. The sum of the numbers from 1 to 25 is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 25 = \frac{25 \times 26}{2} = 325 \]

Since there are 5 rows (or 5 columns), the sum of the numbers in each row (or each column) must be:

\[ \frac{325}{5} = 65 \]

So, the sum of the numbers in each row and each column must be 65. One of the most well-known 5x5 magic squares is the Dürer's magic square, which is constructed as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
17 & 24 & 1 & 8 & 15 \\
23 & 5 & 7 & 14 & 16 \\
4 & 6 & 13 & 20 & 22 \\
10 & 12 & 19 & 21 & 3 \\
11 & 18 & 25 & 2 & 9 \\
\end{array}
\]

We can verify that the sum of each row and each column is indeed 65. For example, the first row is:

\[ 17 + 24 + 1 + 8 + 15 = 65 \]

The first column is:

\[ 17 + 23 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 65 \]

Since the problem asks for the sum of the numbers in each row and each column, and we have verified that the sum is 65 for the given magic square, the answer is:
