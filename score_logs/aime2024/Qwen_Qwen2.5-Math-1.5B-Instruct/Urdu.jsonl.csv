"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - \( s \) is the number of pages in the book that was read.
   - \( t \) is the number of pages in the book that was not read.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - The total number of pages in the book is the sum of the pages read and the pages not read. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     s + t = 120
     \]
   - The number of pages read is 2 more than the number of pages not read. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     s = t + 2
     \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:**
   - Substitute \( s = t + 2 \) into \( s + t = 120 \):
     \[
     (t + 2) + t = 120
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2t + 2 = 120
     \]
   - Subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     2t = 118
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     t = 59
     \]

4. **Find the value of \( s \):**
   - Substitute \( t = 59 \) back into the equation \( s = t + 2 \):
     \[
     s = 59 + 2 = 61
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check if \( s + t = 120 \):
     \[
     61 + 59 = 120
     \]
   - Check if \( s = t + 2 \):
     \[
     61 = 59 + 2
     \]
   - Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

Therefore, the number of pages in the book that was read is \(\boxed{61}\).","[61, '61']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of \(AP\) where \(P\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the line \(BC\) in triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\).

First, we use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle \(ABC\). The semi-perimeter \(s\) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]
The area \(K\) of the triangle is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
The area of the triangle can also be expressed as:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times h = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
Solving for \(h\), we get:
\[
\frac{9h}{2} = 6\sqrt{14} \implies 9h = 12\sqrt{14} \implies h = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]
So, the length of \(AP\) is \(\frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}\). Here, \(m = 4\) and \(n = 3\), so \(m + n = 4 + 3 = 7\).

Thus, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( m+n \) given that the probability of a randomly chosen point inside a square being inside a circle inscribed in the square is \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers.

Let's start by considering a square with side length \(2a\). The area of the square is:
\[
(2a)^2 = 4a^2
\]
The circle inscribed in this square will have a diameter equal to the side length of the square, which is \(2a\). Therefore, the radius of the circle is \(a\). The area of the circle is:
\[
\pi a^2
\]
The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the square is also inside the circle is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square:
\[
\frac{\pi a^2}{4a^2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]
We are given that this probability is \(\frac{m}{n}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]
Since \(\pi\) is an irrational number, the fraction \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is already in its simplest form with \(m = \pi\) and \(n = 4\). However, since \(m\) and \(n\) must be integers, we need to consider the context of the problem. The problem implies that the probability is a rational number, which means we need to find a rational approximation of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) in the form of \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers.

The value of \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14159, so \(\frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.785398\). The fraction \(\frac{3}{4}\) is a close rational approximation of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\). Therefore, we can take \(m = 3\) and \(n = 4\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 3 + 4 = 7

Thus, the value of \(m+n\) is:

"To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then use them to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the given equations.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

We need to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equations:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Let's start by analyzing \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( |x| \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- If \( |x| > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Evaluate \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the cases for \( f(x) \):
- If \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \).
- If \( |\sin(2\pi x)| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 4: Evaluate \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
We need to consider the cases for \( g(x) \):
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 5: Evaluate \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \)
Similarly, since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the cases for \( f(x) \):
- If \( |\cos(3\pi y)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| \).
- If \( |\cos(3\pi y)| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 6: Evaluate \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
We need to consider the cases for \( g(x) \):
- If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( x = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \right) \).
- If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( x = 4 \left( f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \right) \).

### Step 7: Solve the system of equations
By analyzing the equations and the ranges of the trigonometric functions, we find that the only solution that satisfies both equations is:
\[ x = 1 \]
\[ y = 1 \]

Thus, the total number of solutions is:

- For \( m = 8 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 8^4 + 1 = 4096 + 1 = 4097 \), which is not divisible by 4.
- For \( m = 9 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 9^4 + 1 = 6561 + 1 = 6562 \), which is not divisible by 4.

- For \( m = 14 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 14^4 + 1 = 38416 + 1 = 38417 \), which is not divisible by 4.
- For \( m = 15 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 15^4 + 1 = 50625 + 1 = 50626 \), which is not divisible by 4.
- For \( m = 16 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 16^4 + 1 = 65536 + 1 = 65537 \), which is not divisible by 4.
- For \( m = 17 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 17^4 + 1 = 83521 + 1 = 83522 \), which is not divisible by 4.
- For \( m = 18 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 18^4 + 1 = 104976 + 1 = 104977 \), which is not divisible by 4.
- For \( m = 19 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 19^4 + 1 = 130321 + 1 = 130322 \), which is not divisible by 4.
- For \( m = 20 \), \( m^4 + 1 = 20^4 + 1 = 160000 + 1 = 160001 \), which is not divisible by 4.

Finally, for \( m = 15 \), we see that \( 15^4 + 1 = 50626 \), which is divisible by 4. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( m \) is \( 15 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the inradius \( r \) of the cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with given side lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). We will use the formula for the inradius of a cyclic quadrilateral, which is given by:

\[ r = \frac{A}{s} \]

where \(A\) is the area of the quadrilateral and \(s\) is the semiperimeter.

First, we calculate the semiperimeter \(s\):

\[ s = \frac{AB + BC + CD + DA}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}}{2} = \sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} \]

Next, we need to find the area \(A\) of the quadrilateral. Since \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, we can use Brahmagupta's formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral:

\[ A = \sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)} \]

where \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{89}\), \(c = \sqrt{41}\), and \(d = \sqrt{89}\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ A = \sqrt{(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{89})(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{89})} \]
\[ A = \sqrt{(\sqrt{89})(\sqrt{41})(\sqrt{89})(\sqrt{41})} \]
\[ A = \sqrt{(\sqrt{89} \cdot \sqrt{41})^2} \]
\[ A = \sqrt{89 \cdot 41} \]
\[ A = \sqrt{3649} \]

Now, we can find the inradius \(r\):

\[ r = \frac{A}{s} = \frac{\sqrt{3649}}{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}} \]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

\[ r = \frac{\sqrt{3649}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89})(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})} \]
\[ r = \frac{\sqrt{3649}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{89 - 41} \]
\[ r = \frac{\sqrt{3649}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{48} \]

Since \(3649 = 61^2\), we have:

\[ r = \frac{61(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{48} \]

Thus, the inradius \(r\) is in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\) where \(m = 61\), \(n = 1\), and \(p = 48\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 61 + 1 + 48 = 110\).

"1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The sum of the roots of the quadratic equation is 54.
   - The product of the roots is 23.

2. **Formulate the quadratic equation:**
   - Let the roots of the quadratic equation be \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \).
   - According to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \):
     \[
     \alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}
     \]
     \[
     \alpha \beta = \frac{c}{a}
     \]
   - Given \( \alpha + \beta = 54 \) and \( \alpha \beta = 23 \), we can write the quadratic equation as:
     \[
     x^2 - (\alpha + \beta)x + \alpha \beta = 0
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     x^2 - 54x + 23 = 0
     \]

3. **Find the roots of the quadratic equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
     \[
     x = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{54^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 23}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{2916 - 92}}{2}

   - Therefore, the roots are \( \alpha = 27 + \sqrt{706} \) and \( \beta = 27 - \sqrt{706} \).

4. **Calculate the sum of the squares of the roots:**
   - Use the identity \( \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 2\alpha\beta \):
     \[
     \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (27 + \sqrt{706})^2 + (27 - \sqrt{706})^2

     \[
     \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (27^2 + 2 \cdot 27 \cdot \sqrt{706} + 706) + (27^2 - 2 \cdot 27 \cdot \sqrt{706} + 706)

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the value of \(xy\).

First, let's simplify the given logarithmic equations.

Starting with \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\):
\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, consider \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\):
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Now, we use the change of base formula for logarithms. Recall that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}
\]
and
\[
\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}

Let's denote \(\log(x) = a\) and \(\log(y) = b\). Then the equations become:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{a}{b} = \frac{5}{2y}

From \(\frac{b}{a} = \frac{10}{x}\), we get:
\[
b = \frac{10a}{x}
\]

From \(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{5}{2y}\), we get:
\[
a = \frac{5b}{2y}

Substitute \(b = \frac{10a}{x}\) into \(a = \frac{5b}{2y}\):
\[
a = \frac{5 \left(\frac{10a}{x}\right)}{2y} = \frac{50a}{2xy} = \frac{25a}{xy}

Since \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[
1 = \frac{25}{xy}

Solving for \(xy\), we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to distribute 2024 books among \( n \) students such that each student receives at least one book and the number of books each student receives is a power of 2. The powers of 2 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc.

First, we need to find the maximum number of students \( n \) such that the sum of the smallest powers of 2 can be 2024. We start by summing the smallest powers of 2 until the sum is just less than or equal to 2024:

\[
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024 = 2047
\]

Since 2047 is greater than 2024, we exclude the largest power of 2, which is 1024, and sum the remaining powers:

\[
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 = 1023
\]

Now, we need to find the remaining books to reach 2024. The remaining books are:

\[
2024 - 1023 = 1001
\]

We need to express 1001 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. We start with the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1001, which is 512:

\[
1001 - 512 = 489
\]

Next, we use 256:

\[
489 - 256 = 233
\]

Next, we use 128:

\[
233 - 128 = 105

Next, we use 64:

\[
105 - 64 = 41

Next, we use 32:

\[
41 - 32 = 9
\]

Next, we use 8:

\[
9 - 8 = 1

1 - 1 = 0

So, we have expressed 1001 as the sum of the distinct powers of 2: \( 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 1 \). This means we have 7 students who each receive a power of 2, and the remaining 1 student receives 1 book. Therefore, the total number of students is:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10
The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is given by the combination formula:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210

For the sum of four numbers to be even, the number of odd numbers in the selection must be even. The set \( S \) contains 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and 5 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

We need to consider the following cases:
1. **0 odd numbers and 4 even numbers**
2. **2 odd numbers and 2 even numbers**
3. **4 odd numbers and 0 even numbers**

#### Case 1: 0 odd numbers and 4 even numbers
The number of ways to choose 4 even numbers from 5 is:

#### Case 2: 2 odd numbers and 2 even numbers
The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from 5 is:
\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10

The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from 5 is:
\[

Thus, the number of ways to choose 2 odd and 2 even numbers is:
\[
\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{5}{2} = 10 \times 10 = 100
\]

#### Case 3: 4 odd numbers and 0 even numbers
The number of ways to choose 4 odd numbers from 5 is:
\[
\binom{5}{4} = 5
\]

Adding up all the cases, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that their sum is even is:
\[
5 + 100 + 5 = 110
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability
The probability that the sum of four chosen numbers is even is:
\[
\frac{110}{210} = \frac{11}{21}
\]

"1. **Identify the given information and the goal:**
   - We are given a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with points \(E, F, G, H\) inside it.

2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Since \(DE, EF, FG, GH, HC, CE\) are all perpendicular to each other, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in the right triangles formed by these segments.
   - Consider the right triangle \(EFG\):
     \[

     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     184^2 = EG^2 + 17^2

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 16 rooks on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two rooks are in the same row or column. This is a classic problem in combinatorics and can be solved using the concept of permutations.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the constraints**: We need to place 16 rooks on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two rooks are in the same row or column. This means that each row and each column must contain exactly one rook.

2. **Count the number of ways to place the rooks**: The problem reduces to finding the number of ways to assign 8 rows to 8 columns such that each row and each column is used exactly once. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 8 distinct objects.

3. **Calculate the number of permutations**: The number of permutations of 8 distinct objects is given by 8 factorial, denoted as 8!. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1

"Given the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) and the condition \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the value of the expression.

First, let's denote \(z\) as \(z = re^{i\theta}\) where \(r = |z| = 4\). Therefore, \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\).

Now, substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the given expression:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
= 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]
\[
= 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Since \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
= 4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]
\[
= 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of the area of triangle \(ABC\) to the area of the triangle formed by the points where the incircle and the excircle opposite to vertex \(A\) touch the sides of the triangle. Let's denote the points where the incircle touches \(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\) as \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) respectively, and the points where the excircle opposite to vertex \(A\) touches \(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\) as \(D'\), \(E'\), and \(F'\) respectively.

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is denoted as \(\Delta\). The area of the triangle formed by the points \(D\), \(E'\), and \(F'\) is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle DEF' = \frac{r}{2R} \Delta
\]
where \(r\) is the inradius and \(R\) is the circumradius of triangle \(ABC\).

The ratio of the area of triangle \(ABC\) to the area of triangle \(DEF'\) is:
\[
\frac{\Delta}{\frac{r}{2R} \Delta} = \frac{2R}{r}
\]

We know that the ratio of the inradius \(r\) to the circumradius \(R\) of a triangle is given by:
\[
\frac{r}{R} = \frac{4K}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]
where \(K\) is the area of the triangle and \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the sides of the triangle. However, for a general triangle, the ratio \(\frac{2R}{r}\) is a constant that can be derived from the properties of the triangle. For a triangle with sides 2024, 2024, and 2024 (an equilateral triangle), the ratio \(\frac{2R}{r}\) is 2. This is because in an equilateral triangle, \(R = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}\) and \(r = \frac{a \sqrt{3}}{6}\), so \(\frac{2R}{r} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{a \sqrt{3}}{6}} = 4\).

Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle \(ABC\) to the area of the triangle formed by the points where the incircle and the excircle opposite to vertex \(A\) touch the sides of the triangle is:

我们需要找到 $BD^2$ 的值，其中 $ABCD$ 是一个矩形，且 $BD$ 是矩形的对角线。

首先，我们确定双曲线的参数。双曲线的标准形式为：

\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

这里，$a^2 = 20$ 和 $b^2 = 24$。因此，我们有：

\[
a = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \quad \text{和} \quad b = \sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{6}
\]

对于双曲线，焦点之间的距离由 $2c$ 给出，其中 $c$ 由以下方程确定：

\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]

代入 $a^2$ 和 $b^2$ 的值：

\[
c^2 = 20 + 24 = 44 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = \sqrt{44} = 2\sqrt{11}
\]

双曲线的焦点位于 $(\pm c, 0)$，即 $(\pm 2\sqrt{11}, 0)$。

由于 $ABCD$ 是一个矩形，且 $BD$ 是对角线，$BD$ 的长度是焦点之间的距离，即 $2c$。因此：

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \(AB \cdot AC\) in the triangle \(ABC\) with the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given conditions:**
   - \(O\) is the circumcenter of \(\triangle ABC\).
   - \(I\) is the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\).
   - \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\).
   - The length of the angle bisector from \(A\) to the incenter \(I\) is 13.
   - The length of the angle bisector from \(A\) to the circumcenter \(O\) is 13.
   - The length of the angle bisector from \(B\) to the circumcenter \(O\) is 6.
   - The length of the angle bisector from \(C\) to the circumcenter \(O\) is 6.

2. **Use the given perpendicularity condition:**
   Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the point \(A\) lies on the circle with diameter \(\overline{OI}\). This implies that \(A\) is the point where the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) intersects the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\).

3. **Use the angle bisector length formula:**
   The length of the angle bisector from vertex \(A\) to the incenter \(I\) is given by:
   \[
   AI = \frac{2bc}{b+c} \cos \left( \frac{A}{2} \right)
   \]
   The length of the angle bisector from vertex \(A\) to the circumcenter \(O\) is given by:
   \[
   AO = \frac{bc}{b+c} \sec \left( \frac{A}{2} \right)
   \]
   Since \(AI = AO = 13\), we have:
   \[
   \frac{2bc}{b+c} \cos \left( \frac{A}{2} \right) = \frac{bc}{b+c} \sec \left( \frac{A}{2} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2 \cos \left( \frac{A}{2} \right) = \sec \left( \frac{A}{2} \right)
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   2 \cos^2 \left( \frac{A}{2} \right) = 1
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \cos^2 \left( \frac{A}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   So:
   \[
   \cos \left( \frac{A}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   This means:
   \[
   \frac{A}{2} = 45^\circ \implies A = 90^\circ
   \]

4. **Use the properties of the right triangle:**
   Since \(A = 90^\circ\), \(\triangle ABC\) is a right triangle with \(A\) as the right angle. The circumcenter \(O\) is the midpoint of the hypotenuse \(BC\), and the incenter \(I\) is the point where the angle bisectors intersect.

5. **Calculate \(AB \cdot AC\):**
   In a right triangle, the product of the legs is given by:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = BC \cdot r
   \]
   where \(r\) is the inradius. However, we can also use the fact that the length of the angle bisector from the right angle to the incenter is given by:
   \[
   AI = \frac{a + b - c}{2}
   \]
   where \(a = BC\), \(b = AC\), and \(c = AB\). Since \(AI = 13\), we have:
   \[
   13 = \frac{a + b - c}{2}
   \]
   Also, the length of the angle bisector from the right angle to the circumcenter is given by:
   \[
   AO = \frac{a}{2}
   \]
   Since \(AO = 13\), we have:
   \[
   13 = \frac{a}{2} \implies a = 26

   Therefore:

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We know from the problem statement that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]
So, we can substitute this into the equation:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]
Now, let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equation \(100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\), we get:
\[100(100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100) - 100 \cdot 100 \cdot 100 = 100(3 \cdot 10,000) - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000.\]
This satisfies the equation, so the values \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\) are correct.

\[
C = (1-t)A + tB = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is:
\[

The area of triangle \(OAC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle OAC = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0\left(0 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t - 0\right) + 0\left(0 - 0\right) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}t

We are given that the area of triangle \(OAC\) is half the area of triangle \(OAB\):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}t = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \implies t = \frac{1}{2}

Substituting \(t = \frac{1}{2}\) into the parameterization of \(C\), we get:
\[
C = \left(\frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)

"To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. This means \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

We can factor this expression by considering the polynomial whose roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), and the roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We can use the fact that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) to simplify the expression.

Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) implies \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

Now, let's consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial can be found using the resultant of the polynomials.

The polynomial \(2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at \(x = \omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) is:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

The product of these values is the resultant of the polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). The resultant of two polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) is a number that is zero if and only if the two polynomials have a common root.

The polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) has roots \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) has roots that are the solutions to the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0\). The roots of this quadratic equation are:
\[x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2i}{2} = 1 \pm i.\]

Since \(1 \pm i\) are not roots of \(x^{13} - 1\), the polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) have no common roots. Therefore, the resultant of \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) is non-zero.

The resultant of \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) is the product of the values of \(Q(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\). Since \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) is a quadratic polynomial, the product of the values of \(Q(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\) is:

This product is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \(P(x)\) raised to the power of the degree of \(Q(x)\), which is 13. Therefore, the product is:
\[1^{13} = 1.\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sides of a polygon where the sum of the interior angles is equal to the sum of the exterior angles.

First, let's recall the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

Next, we know that the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \( 360 \) degrees, regardless of the number of sides.

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is equal to the sum of the exterior angles. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
180(n-2) = 360
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:
\[
n-2 = 2
\]

Next, we add 2 to both sides:
\[
n = 4
\]

Thus, the polygon has \( 4 \) sides. This polygon is a quadrilateral.

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of pages in the book and the number of pages in each volume. Let's denote the number of volumes by \( n \) and the number of pages in each volume by \( p \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of pages in the book is 30.
2. The total number of pages in all volumes except the first is 9.
3. The total number of pages in all volumes except the last is also 9.

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ (n-1)p = 9 \]
From the third piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ (n-1)p = 9 \]
This tells us that the total number of pages in the book is the sum of the pages in all volumes except the first and the pages in all volumes except the last, minus the pages in the first and the last volume. Therefore, we can write:
\[ np = 30 \]
\[ (n-2)p = 12 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( np = 30 \)
2. \( (n-2)p = 12 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's express \( p \) from the first equation:
\[ p = \frac{30}{n} \]

Next, substitute \( p \) into the second equation:
\[ (n-2) \left( \frac{30}{n} \right) = 12 \]
\[ 30(n-2) = 12n \]
\[ 30n - 60 = 12n \]
\[ 18n = 60 \]
\[ n = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's try to find integer solutions for \( n \) and \( p \) that satisfy both equations. From the equation \( (n-2)p = 12 \), we can see that \( n-2 \) must be a divisor of 12. The possible values for \( n-2 \) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Therefore, the possible values for \( n \) are 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 14.

Let's check each value:
- If \( n = 3 \), then \( p = \frac{30}{3} = 10 \). But \( (3-2) \cdot 10 = 10 \neq 12 \), so \( n = 3 \) is not a solution.
- If \( n = 4 \), then \( p = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \), which is not an integer, so \( n = 4 \) is not a solution.
- If \( n = 5 \), then \( p = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \). But \( (5-2) \cdot 6 = 18 \neq 12 \), so \( n = 5 \) is not a solution.
- If \( n = 6 \), then \( p = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \). And \( (6-2) \cdot 5 = 20 \neq 12 \), so \( n = 6 \) is not a solution.
- If \( n = 8 \), then \( p = \frac{30}{8} = 3.75 \), which is not an integer, so \( n = 8 \) is not a solution.
- If \( n = 14 \), then \( p = \frac{30}{14} = \frac{15}{7} \), which is not an integer, so \( n = 14 \) is not a solution.

We need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's try a different approach. Let's assume \( n = 5 \) and check the conditions:
- If \( n = 5 \), then \( p = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \). And \( (5-2) \cdot 6 = 18 \neq 12 \), so \( n = 5 \) is not a solution.

Finally, let's try \( n = 6 \) and check the conditions:
- If \( n = 6 \), then \( p = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \). And \( (6-2) \cdot 5 = 20 \neq 12 \), so \( n = 6 \) is not a solution.

The correct solution is:
\[ n = 5 \]
\[ p = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of volumes is 5 and the number of pages in each volume is 6. The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the pattern in the given examples and apply it to the new problem. Let's analyze the examples step by step.

### Example 1:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Here, the sum of the numbers in the first row is \(0 + 0 + 8 = 8\), and the sum of the numbers in the second row is \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\). The total sum of all the numbers in the grid is \(8 + 19 = 27\), which is equal to \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

### Example 2:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
9 & 9 & 81 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 81 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Here, the sum of the numbers in the first row is \(9 + 9 + 81 = 99\), and the sum of the numbers in the second row is \(9 + 9 + 81 = 99\). The total sum of all the numbers in the grid is \(99 + 99 = 198\), which is equal to \(99 \times 2 = 198\).

### Applying the Pattern to the New Problem:
We need to find a similar pattern for the new problem where the total sum of the numbers in the grid is 999. Let's assume the grid is a 3x3 grid with the following structure:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
g & h & i \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
We need to find values for \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i\) such that the sum of the numbers in each row and each column is 99, and the total sum of all the numbers in the grid is 999.

One possible solution is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
8 & 9 & 82 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 81 \\
\hline
82 & 81 & 8 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Let's check the sums:
- The sum of the first row is \(8 + 9 + 82 = 99\).
- The sum of the second row is \(9 + 9 + 81 = 99\).
- The sum of the third row is \(82 + 81 + 8 = 171\), but we need to adjust this to make the total sum 999. Instead, let's use:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
8 & 9 & 82 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 81 \\
\hline
82 & 81 & 8 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
- The sum of the first row is \(8 + 9 + 82 = 99\).
- The sum of the second row is \(9 + 9 + 81 = 99\).
- The sum of the third row is \(82 + 81 + 8 = 171\), but we need to adjust this to make the total sum 999. Instead, let's use:

"To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by rewriting each equation in exponential form.

The first equation is:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
So, we have:
\[
x = yz \sqrt{2}
\]

The second equation is:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]
So, we have:
\[
y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}
\]

The third equation is:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]
So, we have:
\[
z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Now we have three equations:
1. \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\)
2. \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

We can substitute the expressions for \(y\) and \(z\) from the second and third equations into the first equation. First, substitute \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\) into \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\):
\[
x = (xz \cdot 2^{1/3})z \sqrt{2} = xz^2 \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/2} = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}
\]
Since \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}
\]
So,
\[
z^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]
\[
z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

Next, substitute \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\):
\[
y = x \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/3} = x \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{4/12} = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}
\]
So,
\[
y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}
\]

Finally, substitute \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\):
\[
2^{-5/12} = x \cdot (x \cdot 2^{-1/12}) \cdot 2^{1/4} = x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12} \cdot 2^{1/4} = x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12} \cdot 2^{3/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{2/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{1/6}
\]
So,
\[
2^{-5/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{1/6}
\]
\[
x^2 = 2^{-5/12 - 1/6} = 2^{-5/12 - 2/12} = 2^{-7/12}
\]
\[
x = 2^{-7/24}
\]

Now we have \(x = 2^{-7/24}\), \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-2/24} = 2^{-9/24} = 2^{-3/8}\), and \(z = 2^{-5/12} = 2^{-10/24}\).

We need to find \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\):
\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-28/24} = 2^{-7/6}
\]
\[
y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}
\]
\[
z^2 = (2^{-10/24})^2 = 2^{-20/24} = 2^{-5/6}
\]
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6} = 2^{-7/6 - 5/6 - 9/8} = 2^{-12/6 - 9/8} = 2^{-2 - 9/8} = 2^{-16/8 - 9/8} = 2^{-25/8}
\]
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

So, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), and \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of terms in the sequences \(A\) and \(B\). The sequences are arithmetic sequences, and the sum of the terms in each sequence is given.

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) \]
where \(a\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the number of terms.

For sequence \(A\), the first term is 1, the last term is 2024, and the number of terms is \(n_A\). The sum of the terms in sequence \(A\) is:
\[ S_{n_A} = \frac{n_A}{2} (1 + 2024) = \frac{n_A}{2} \cdot 2025 = 1012.5 n_A \]

For sequence \(B\), the first term is 2, the last term is 2023, and the number of terms is \(n_B\). The sum of the terms in sequence \(B\) is:
\[ S_{n_B} = \frac{n_B}{2} (2 + 2023) = \frac{n_B}{2} \cdot 2025 = 1012.5 n_B \]

We are given that the sum of the terms in sequence \(A\) is equal to the sum of the terms in sequence \(B\):
\[ 1012.5 n_A = 1012.5 n_B \]
This simplifies to:
\[ n_A = n_B \]

However, we need to find the number of terms in sequence \(A\). The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence can also be found using the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]
For sequence \(A\), the last term is 2024, the first term is 1, and the common difference is 1 (since it is an arithmetic sequence with consecutive integers):
\[ 2024 = 1 + (n_A - 1) \cdot 1 \]
\[ 2024 = 1 + n_A - 1 \]
\[ 2024 = n_A \]

Therefore, the number of terms in sequence \(A\) is:
\[ \boxed{2024} \]","[2024, '2024']",55,"[55, '55']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \(N\) and \(Q\) and then find the value of \(Q + R\).

First, let's determine the value of \(N\). The problem states that \(N\) is the number of sides of a polygon. The number of diagonals in a polygon with \(N\) sides is given by the formula:
\[
\frac{N(N-3)}{2}
\]
We are given that the number of diagonals is 77. So, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{N(N-3)}{2} = 77
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
N(N-3) = 154
\]
This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring:
\[
N^2 - 3N - 154 = 0
\]
We need to find two numbers that multiply to -154 and add up to -3. These numbers are -14 and 11. So, we can factor the quadratic equation as:
\[
(N-14)(N+11) = 0
\]
Setting each factor to zero, we get:
\[
N-14 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad N+11 = 0
\]
\[
N = 14 \quad \text{or} \quad N = -11
\]
Since \(N\) must be a positive integer, we have:
\[
N = 14
\]

Next, we need to determine the value of \(Q\). The problem states that \(Q\) is the number of sides of another polygon, and the number of sides of this polygon is such that the number of sides of the first polygon plus the number of sides of the second polygon is 1000. So, we have:
\[
N + Q = 1000
\]
Substituting \(N = 14\) into the equation, we get:
\[
14 + Q = 1000
\]
\[
Q = 986
\]

Finally, we need to determine the value of \(R\). The problem states that \(R\) is the number of sides of a third polygon, and the number of sides of this polygon is such that the number of sides of the first polygon plus the number of sides of the second polygon plus the number of sides of the third polygon is \(Q + R\). Since we already know \(Q = 986\), we can write:
\[
N + Q + R = Q + R
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
14 + 986 + R = 986 + R
\]
\[
1000 + R = 986 + R
\]
Subtracting \(R\) from both sides, we get:
\[
1000 = 986
\]
This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that \(R\) is the number of sides of a polygon such that the total number of sides of the three polygons is 1000. So, we have:
\[
N + Q + R = 1000
\]
Substituting \(N = 14\) and \(Q = 986\) into the equation, we get:
\[
14 + 986 + R = 1000
\]
\[
1000 = 1000
\]
This is true, so \(R = 0\).

Therefore, the value of \(Q + R\) is:
\[
Q + R = 986 + 0 = 986
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{986}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of the radii of two circles and then find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this ratio in its simplest form.

First, let's denote the radius of the larger circle as \( r_i \) and the radius of the smaller circle as \( r_o \). The problem states that the ratio of the radii is \( \frac{r_i}{r_o} = \frac{11}{5} \). This means that \( r_i = \frac{11}{5} r_o \).

The problem also states that the difference in the radii is \( r_i - r_o = \frac{m}{n} \). Substituting \( r_i = \frac{11}{5} r_o \) into the difference equation, we get:
\[
r_i - r_o = \frac{11}{5} r_o - r_o = \frac{11}{5} r_o - \frac{5}{5} r_o = \frac{6}{5} r_o
\]
So, \( \frac{m}{n} = \frac{6}{5} \), which means \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 5 \).

The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this ratio in its simplest form. Therefore, we have:
\[
m + n = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pages in the book and then find out how many pages are left after reading 25 pages per day for 5 days.

First, let's determine the total number of pages in the book. The book is divided into 25 chapters, and each chapter has 25 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ 25 \text{ chapters} \times 25 \text{ pages per chapter} = 625 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages are read in 5 days if 25 pages are read each day. The total number of pages read in 5 days is:
\[ 25 \text{ pages per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 125 \text{ pages} \]

To find out how many pages are left in the book, we subtract the number of pages read from the total number of pages:
\[ 625 \text{ pages} - 125 \text{ pages} = 500 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the number of pages left in the book is:
