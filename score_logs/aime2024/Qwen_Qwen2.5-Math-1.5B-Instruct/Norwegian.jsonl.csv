"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time \( t \) it takes Aya to walk \( s \) kilometers and then use this information to find the time it takes her to walk \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers.

First, let's establish the relationship between the distance walked and the time taken. We know that Aya walks at a constant speed, so the time taken to walk a distance is directly proportional to the distance. Let's denote the time it takes Aya to walk 1 kilometer as \( \frac{t}{s} \) minutes.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. When Aya walks \( s \) kilometers, it takes her \( t \) minutes.
2. When Aya walks \( s + 2 \) kilometers, it takes her \( t + 24 \) minutes.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
\[ t = s \cdot \frac{t}{s} \]
\[ t + 24 = (s + 2) \cdot \frac{t}{s} \]

The first equation is trivially true, so we focus on the second equation:
\[ t + 24 = s \cdot \frac{t}{s} + 2 \cdot \frac{t}{s} \]
\[ t + 24 = t + \frac{2t}{s} \]
Subtract \( t \) from both sides:
\[ 24 = \frac{2t}{s} \]
Multiply both sides by \( s \):
\[ 24s = 2t \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 12s = t \]
So, the time it takes Aya to walk 1 kilometer is \( \frac{t}{s} = \frac{12s}{s} = 12 \) minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes Aya to walk \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers. Since it takes her 12 minutes to walk 1 kilometer, it will take her:
\[ 12 \left( s + \frac{1}{2} \right) = 12s + 6 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time it takes Aya to walk \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers is:
\[ \boxed{12s + 6} \]","[12*s + 6, '12s + 6']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\) with the described tangent and secant properties, we will use the Power of a Point theorem and properties of similar triangles.

First, let's label the points and lengths:
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(BC = 9\)
- \(AC = 10\)
- \(D\) is the point where the tangent at \(B\) and the tangent at \(C\) meet.
- \(P\) is the point where the line \(AD\) intersects the circle \(\omega\) again.

By the Power of a Point theorem at point \(A\), we have:
\[ AB \cdot AC = AD \cdot AP \]
Since \(AD\) is a secant and \(AP\) is a part of the secant, we can write:
\[ AB \cdot AC = AD \cdot AP \]
\[ 5 \cdot 10 = AD \cdot AP \]
\[ 50 = AD \cdot AP \]

Next, we need to find the length of \(AD\). Since \(D\) is the point where the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) meet, \(D\) is the excenter of the triangle \(ABC\) opposite to \(A\). The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle, but we can also use the fact that \(AD\) is the sum of the segments of the secant \(AD\) and \(AP\).

Since \(P\) is the other intersection of the line \(AD\) with the circle, we can use the fact that \(AP\) is the part of the secant that is outside the circle. The length \(AP\) can be found by solving the equation:
\[ 50 = AD \cdot AP \]

To find \(AD\), we use the fact that the power of point \(A\) with respect to the circle is the same for both tangents and the secant. The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle, but we can also use the fact that \(AD\) is the sum of the segments of the secant \(AD\) and \(AP\).

Since \(P\) is the other intersection of the line \(AD\) with the circle, we can use the fact that \(AP\) is the part of the secant that is outside the circle. The length \(AP\) can be found by solving the equation:
\[ 50 = AD \cdot AP \]

To find \(AD\), we use the fact that the power of point \(A\) with respect to the circle is the same for both tangents and the secant. The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle, but we can also use the fact that \(AD\) is the sum of the segments of the secant \(AD\) and \(AP\).

Since \(P\) is the other intersection of the line \(AD\) with the circle, we can use the fact that \(AP\) is the part of the secant that is outside the circle. The length \(AP\) can be found by solving the equation:
\[ 50 = AD \cdot AP \]

\[ 50 = AD \cdot AP \]

The length \(AP\) is:
\[ AP = \frac{50}{AD} \]

Since \(AD = 10\), we have:
\[ AP = \frac{50}{10} = 5 \]

Thus, the length \(AP\) is \(\frac{25}{3}\), and the sum of the numerator and the denominator is:
\[ m + n = 25 + 3 = 28 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that all the blue blocks end up in the correct positions after the red blocks are removed. Let's denote the number of red blocks by \( r \) and the number of blue blocks by \( b \). The total number of blocks is \( r + b \).

The probability that all the blue blocks end up in the correct positions after the red blocks are removed is the same as the probability that the red blocks are in the first \( r \) positions out of the \( r + b \) positions. This probability is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to arrange the red blocks in the first \( r \) positions, which is \( 1 \) (since there is only one way to arrange \( r \) red blocks in \( r \) positions). The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to arrange all \( r + b \) blocks, which is \( (r + b)! \).

Therefore, the probability is:
\[
\frac{1}{\binom{r+b}{r}} = \frac{r!b!}{(r+b)!}
\]

We are given that this probability is equal to \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime positive integers. We need to find \( m + n \).

For the specific case where \( r = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \), the probability is:
\[
\frac{2!2!}{(2+2)!} = \frac{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4}{24} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 6 \), and since \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime, we have \( m + n = 1 + 6 = 7 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then determine the number of intersection points between the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|| \]
\[ g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \]

We need to understand the behavior of these functions. The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( x \in [-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}] \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).
- For \( x \in [-1, -\frac{1}{2}) \cup (\frac{1}{2}, 1] \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} + |x| \).

The function \( g(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( x \in [-\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}] \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).
- For \( x \in [-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}) \cup (\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}] \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} + |x| \).

Now, let's analyze the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):
- The function \( \sin(2\pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1.
- The function \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) because \( f(x) \) maps \([-1, 1]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).
- The function \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\) because \( g(x) \) maps \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\).
- Therefore, \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will take values in the range \([0, 1]\).

Next, let's analyze the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):
- The function \( \cos(3\pi y) \) oscillates between -1 and 1.
- The function \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) because \( f(x) \) maps \([-1, 1]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).
- The function \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will take values in the range \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\) because \( g(x) \) maps \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\).
- Therefore, \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will take values in the range \([0, 1]\).

To find the intersection points, we need to solve the equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). Since both \( x \) and \( y \) are in the range \([0, 1]\), we need to find the points where these two functions intersect.

By analyzing the behavior of the functions, we can see that the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) are periodic and symmetric. The number of intersection points can be determined by considering the periodicity and symmetry of the functions.

After careful analysis, we find that there are 8 intersection points. Therefore, the number of intersection points is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its faces, given the edge lengths. The incenter of a tetrahedron is the point where the four perpendiculars from the vertices to the opposite faces intersect, and it is equidistant from all four faces.

First, we need to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

For our tetrahedron, the edge lengths are \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \). Plugging these values into the determinant, we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 89 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating this determinant, we find:

\[
288 V^2 = 288 \times 2400
\]

\[
V^2 = 2400
\]

\[
V = \sqrt{2400} = 40\sqrt{1.5} = 40 \times \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} = 20\sqrt{6}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of one of the faces of the tetrahedron. The area of a triangle with sides \( a, b, c \) can be found using Heron's formula. For triangle \( ABC \) with sides \( AB = \sqrt{41} \), \( BC = \sqrt{89} \), and \( AC = \sqrt{80} \), the semi-perimeter \( s \) is:

\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80}}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of triangle \( ABC \) is:

\[
A = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{89})(s - \sqrt{80})}
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the tetrahedron is symmetric and the area of each face is the same. The area of each face can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with given sides, but for simplicity, we can use the fact that the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron can also be expressed as:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
\]

Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, the height from the incenter to any face is the same. Let \( h \) be the height from the incenter to any face. Then:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Area of one face} \times h
\]

The area of one face is the same for all faces, so let \( A \) be the area of one face. Then:

\[
20\sqrt{6} = \frac{1}{3} \times A \times h
\]

\[
60\sqrt{6} = A \times h
\]

Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, the area \( A \) of one face can be found using the fact that the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths \( \sqrt{41}, \sqrt{80}, \sqrt{89} \). The area of one face is:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \text{side}^2
\]

However, for simplicity, we can use the fact that the area of one face is the same for all faces, so:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 80 = 20\sqrt{6}
\]

Then:

\[
60\sqrt{6} = 20\sqrt{6} \times h
\]

\[
h = 3
\]

Thus, the distance from the incenter to each face is \( \frac{3\sqrt{6}}{2} \). Therefore, the distance from the incenter to each face is:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular boxes in the set \(\mathcal{B}\) and then find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each box. The volume of each box is given as 23, and the surface area is given as 54. Let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

First, we use the volume formula:
\[abc = 23.\]

Next, we use the surface area formula:
\[2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \implies ab + bc + ca = 27.\]

We need to find the dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations. Since 23 is a prime number, the only possible integer dimensions are \(1\), \(1\), and \(23\). Let's check if these dimensions satisfy the surface area equation:
\[ab + bc + ca = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 23 + 23 \cdot 1 = 1 + 23 + 23 = 47.\]
This does not satisfy the surface area equation. Therefore, the dimensions must be non-integer. However, since the problem specifies that the dimensions are integers, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints or consider the possibility of a different interpretation. Given the constraints, let's assume the problem is correctly stated and proceed with the integer dimensions.

The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box has a diameter equal to the length of the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular box with dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
\[d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}.\]
The radius \(r\) of the sphere is half of the space diagonal:
\[r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}.\]
We need to find \(r^2\):
\[r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4}.\]

Since the exact dimensions are not integers, we need to consider the problem constraints again. Given the problem constraints, let's assume the problem is correctly stated and proceed with the integer dimensions. The correct interpretation is that the dimensions are non-integer, and we need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each box.

Given the problem constraints, the correct interpretation is that the dimensions are non-integer, and we need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each box. The correct answer is:
\[r^2 = \frac{23}{2},\]
where \(p = 23\) and \(q = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(p + q\) is:
\[p + q = 23 + 2 = 25.\]

"To solve for \(xy\) given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we will start by simplifying each equation using properties of logarithms.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we can rewrite this as:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10.
\]
Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we can substitute this in:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x).
\]
Dividing both sides by \(\log(x)\) (assuming \(x \neq 1\)), we get:
\[
x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \implies \log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}.
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Again, using the power rule of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10.
\]
Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can substitute this in:
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y).
\]
Dividing both sides by \(\log(y)\) (assuming \(y \neq 1\)), we get:
\[
4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \implies \log(x) = \frac{10 \log(y)}{4y} = \frac{5 \log(y)}{2y}.
\]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log(y)\) and \(\log(x)\):
\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log(x) = \frac{5 \log(y)}{2y}.
\]
Substituting \(\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\) into \(\log(x) = \frac{5 \log(y)}{2y}\), we get:
\[
\log(x) = \frac{5 \left(\frac{10 \log(x)}{x}\right)}{2y} = \frac{50 \log(x)}{2xy} = \frac{25 \log(x)}{xy}.
\]
Assuming \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(\log(x)\):
\[
1 = \frac{25}{xy} \implies xy = 25.
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game strategy. The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing either 1 or 4 b square from a row of \( n \) b square. The player who takes the last b square wins.

We can use the concept of winning and losing positions to solve this problem. A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.

Let's define \( W \) as a winning position and \( L \) as a losing position. The base cases are:
- \( n = 0 \): This is a losing position because there are no b square left to take.

Now, let's determine the positions for \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \):
- \( n = 1 \): Alice can take the last b square, so this is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 2 \): Alice can take 1 b square, leaving Bob with 1 b square, so this is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 3 \): Alice can take 1 b square, leaving Bob with 2 b square, or 4 b square, leaving Bob with 1 b square. In both cases, Bob can force a win, so this is a losing position \( L \).
- \( n = 4 \): Alice can take 4 b square, leaving Bob with 0 b square, so this is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 5 \): Alice can take 1 b square, leaving Bob with 4 b square, or 4 b square, leaving Bob with 1 b square. In both cases, Bob can force a win, so this is a losing position \( L \).
- \( n = 6 \): Alice can take 1 b square, leaving Bob with 5 b square, or 4 b square, leaving Bob with 2 b square. In both cases, Bob can force a win, so this is a losing position \( L \).
- \( n = 7 \): Alice can take 1 b square, leaving Bob with 6 b square, or 4 b square, leaving Bob with 3 b square. In both cases, Bob can force a win, so this is a losing position \( L \).

From the above analysis, we can see a pattern: the positions \( n = 3, 5, 6, 7 \) are losing positions, and the positions \( n = 1, 2, 4 \) are winning positions. We can generalize this pattern by noting that the positions \( n = 3k \) and \( n = 3k+1 \) are losing positions, and the positions \( n = 3k+2 \) are winning positions for \( k \geq 1 \).

To find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to count the number of integers \( n \) of the form \( 3k+2 \) where \( k \) is a non-negative integer and \( n \leq 2024 \).

The largest integer \( k \) such that \( 3k+2 \leq 2024 \) is \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{2022}{3} \right\rfloor = 674 \). Therefore, \( k \) can take any integer value from 0 to 674, inclusive. This gives us 675 possible values for \( k \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{675}\).","[675, '675']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Jen wins the highest score given that she picks 4 numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). Jen wins if at least 2 of her 4 numbers are greater than or equal to the highest number among her 4 numbers, and she wins the highest score if all 4 of her numbers are greater than or equal to the highest number among the remaining 6 numbers.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where Jen wins the highest score. This means that the highest number among the 4 numbers she picks must be at least 3 (since if it were 2, she would not have enough numbers greater than or equal to it to win the highest score).

Let's consider the cases where the highest number is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.

1. If the highest number is 3, the other 3 numbers must be chosen from \(\{1, 2\}\), but this is not possible since we need 3 numbers and there are only 2 numbers in \(\{1, 2\}\).

2. If the highest number is 4, the other 3 numbers must be chosen from \(\{1, 2, 3\}\). The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 3 is:
\[
\binom{3}{3} = 1
\]

3. If the highest number is 5, the other 3 numbers must be chosen from \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\). The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 4 is:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]

4. If the highest number is 6, the other 3 numbers must be chosen from \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\). The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 5 is:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10
\]

5. If the highest number is 7, the other 3 numbers must be chosen from \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 6 is:
\[
\binom{6}{3} = 20
\]

6. If the highest number is 8, the other 3 numbers must be chosen from \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\). The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 7 is:
\[
\binom{7}{3} = 35
\]

7. If the highest number is 9, the other 3 numbers must be chosen from \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\). The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 8 is:
\[
\binom{8}{3} = 56
\]

8. If the highest number is 10, the other 3 numbers must be chosen from \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\). The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 9 is:
\[
\binom{9}{3} = 84
\]

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[
1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 56 + 84 = 210
\]

The probability that Jen wins the highest score is:
\[
\frac{210}{210} = 1
\]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{1}{1}\), and \(m = 1\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 1 = 2\).

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
   Since \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic. This means that the opposite angles of \(ADHG\) sum up to \(180^\circ\).

2. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the power of a point theorem. The power of point \(E\) with respect to the circle is the same whether we consider the segments \(BC\) and \(EF\) or \(AB\) and \(FG\).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The power of point \(E\) with respect to the circle is given by:

   We are given \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that the power of point \(E\) is the same for both segments.

5. **Calculate \(CE\):**
   Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that the power of point \(E\) is the same for both segments. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   CE \cdot CD = EF \cdot EG

"To find the largest real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplifying the second term, we get:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + 24(1 + 1.5i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

We can write \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 24(1 + 1.5i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Expanding both terms, we get:

\[
4(75\cos\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24(\cos\theta + 1.5i\cos\theta - i\sin\theta + 1.5\sin\theta)

\[

Separating the real and imaginary parts, we get:

\[

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(432\cos\theta + 264\sin\theta)

The real part of the expression is:

\[

To find the maximum value of this expression, we use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so the maximum value is:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540

"To solve the problem, we need to find the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) and express it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers. We will then find the sum \(m+n\).

First, let's recall some properties of the triangle and the given information:
- The incircle of triangle \(ABC\) is tangent to sides \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\) at points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) respectively.
- The radius of the incircle is given as 34.
- The incircle is tangent to the sides of the triangle at points that are 1 unit away from the sides of the triangle.

The inradius \(r\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ r = \frac{A}{s} \]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

Given that the inradius is 34, we have:
\[ r = 34 \]

The inradius of the triangle formed by the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides of the triangle is 1 unit less than the inradius of the original triangle. Therefore, the inradius of the triangle formed by the points of tangency is:
\[ r' = 34 - 1 = 33 \]

The area \(A\) of the triangle can be expressed in terms of its inradius and semi-perimeter:
\[ A = r \cdot s = 34 \cdot s \]

The area of the triangle can also be expressed in terms of the inradius of the smaller triangle and its semi-perimeter:
\[ A = r' \cdot s' = 33 \cdot s' \]

Since the smaller triangle is similar to the original triangle, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. The ratio of the inradii is the same as the ratio of the corresponding sides:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a rectangle \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) such that the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) pass through the origin.

First, let's consider the general form of the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Since the diagonals pass through the origin, the vertices of the rectangle can be represented as \((x, y)\), \((-x, y)\), \((-x, -y)\), and \((x, -y)\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is the distance between \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\), which is given by:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2} = 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\).

Next, we need to use the equation of the hyperbola to express \(y^2\) in terms of \(x^2\). The equation of the hyperbola is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]
Solving for \(y^2\), we get:
\[
\frac{y^2}{24} = \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \implies y^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{24x^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24
\]
Substituting \(y^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4 \left( x^2 + \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{5x^2 + 6x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{11x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{44x^2}{5} - 96
\]
To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x^2\). Since \(x^2\) can be any non-negative real number, we need to find the maximum value of \(x^2\) such that the expression \(\frac{44x^2}{5} - 96\) is still valid. However, there is no upper bound on \(x^2\) in the hyperbola, but we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for the given hyperbola.

The maximum value of \(BD^2\) occurs when \(x^2\) is as large as possible, but since there is no upper bound, we need to consider the behavior of the function. The function \(\frac{44x^2}{5} - 96\) is a linear function in terms of \(x^2\) and it increases without bound as \(x^2\) increases. However, the problem asks for the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for all possible rectangles, and the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is not bounded by any finite value.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is not a finite number, and the problem is asking for the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for all possible rectangles, which is not bounded. However, if we consider the problem in the context of the hyperbola and the given conditions, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is not bounded by any finite value.

"Given that \(\triangle ABC\) has circumcenter \(O\) and incenter \(I\) with \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the circumradius \(R = 13\), and the inradius \(r = 6\), we need to find the product \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall the relationship between the circumradius \(R\), the inradius \(r\), and the distance \(d\) between the circumcenter \(O\) and the incenter \(I\):
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\):
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \(d = \sqrt{13}\).

Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the triangle \(\triangle OAI\) is a right triangle with \(\angle OAI = 90^\circ\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle OAI\):
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + AI^2
\]
We know \(OA = R = 13\) and \(OI = d = \sqrt{13}\). Let \(AI = x\). Then:
\[
13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + x^2
\]
\[
169 = 13 + x^2
\]
\[
x^2 = 156
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \(AI\) is the distance from the incenter to a vertex, which is related to the area \(K\) of the triangle and the semiperimeter \(s\) by the formula:
\[
AI = \frac{2K}{a + b + c} = \frac{2K}{2s} = \frac{K}{s}
\]
where \(s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}\) is the semiperimeter. We also know that the area \(K\) can be expressed in terms of the inradius \(r\) and the semiperimeter \(s\):
\[
K = r \cdot s = 6s
\]
Thus:
\[
AI = \frac{6s}{s} = 6
\]
However, we previously found \(AI = 2\sqrt{39}\). This discrepancy suggests a re-evaluation of the problem constraints or a different approach. Instead, we use the fact that the product \(AB \cdot AC\) can be found using the formula involving the circumradius \(R\) and the inradius \(r\):
\[
AB \cdot AC = 4Rr
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\):
\[
AB \cdot AC = 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 312

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equations. We have two equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 300\)
2. \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\)

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that the second equation can be rewritten using the identity for the sum of products of the variables taken two at a time:

\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]

We know from the problem statement that this expression equals 6,000,000, so we have:

\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:

\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]

Now, let's consider possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are non-negative integers and their sum is 300, one of them must be very large to satisfy the equation. Let's assume \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\). Then:

\[a + b + c = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300,\]
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 6 \cdot 100^3 = 6,000,000.\]

This satisfies both equations. Therefore, the only solution is \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that the square of the distance from the origin \(O\) to \(C\) is \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. We then need to find the sum \(p+q\).

First, let's determine the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ A = \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \]
\[ B = \left( 0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \]

The equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) can be found using the two-point form of the line equation:
\[ y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} (x - x_1) \]
Substituting the coordinates of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ y - 0 = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} (x - \frac{1}{2}) \]
\[ y = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}} (x - \frac{1}{2}) \]
\[ y = -\sqrt{3} (x - \frac{1}{2}) \]
\[ y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Now, let \(C\) be a point on \(\overline{AB}\) with coordinates \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) lies on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), its coordinates must satisfy the equation of the line:
\[ y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

The distance \(OC\) from the origin \(O\) to \(C\) is given by:
\[ OC = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the distance formula:
\[ OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2} \]
\[ OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( 3x^2 - 3x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{3}{4} \right)} \]
\[ OC = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{3}{4}} \]
\[ OC = \sqrt{4x^2 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{3}{4}} \]

We are given that \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\). Therefore:
\[ OC^2 = 4x^2 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{3}{4} \]

To find the coordinates of \(C\) such that \(OC^2\) is a rational number, we need to ensure that the expression \(4x^2 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{3}{4}\) is rational. This implies that the term involving \(\sqrt{3}\) must be zero. Therefore, we set the coefficient of \(\sqrt{3}\) to zero:
\[ -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

Substituting \(x = 0\) back into the equation of the line:
\[ y = -\sqrt{3}(0) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[ C = \left( 0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \]

Now, we calculate \(OC^2\):
\[ OC^2 = 0^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 \]
\[ OC^2 = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 4\). The sum \(p + q\) is:

Q(\omega^k) = 2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2 = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}
\]

Thus, the product becomes:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

To find this product, we use the fact that the polynomial \(Q(x)\) evaluated at the roots of unity can be related to the polynomial \(P(x)\). Specifically, we use the fact that the product of \(Q(\omega^k)\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\) is related to the resultant of the polynomials \(Q(x)\) and \(P(x)\).

The resultant of two polynomials \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) is a number that is zero if and only if \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) have a common root. For polynomials \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) of degrees \(m\) and \(n\) respectively, the resultant is given by:
\[
\text{Res}(f, g) = \prod_{i=1}^m f(\alpha_i) \prod_{j=1}^n g(\beta_j)
\]
where \(\alpha_i\) and \(\beta_j\) are the roots of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) respectively.

In our case, \(f(x) = Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) and \(g(x) = P(x) = x^{13} - 1\). The degree of \(Q(x)\) is 2 and the degree of \(P(x)\) is 13. Therefore, the resultant is:
\[
\text{Res}(Q, P) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k)
\]

The resultant of \(Q(x)\) and \(P(x)\) can be computed using properties of cyclotomic polynomials and symmetric functions. However, a known result in algebraic number theory states that the resultant of \(x^n - 1\) and \(a + bx + cx^2\) is given by:
\[
\text{Res}(x^n - 1, a + bx + cx^2) = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} n^n c^{n-1} b^{n-2}
\]

For \(n = 13\), \(a = 2\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 1\), we have:
\[
\text{Res}(x^{13} - 1, 2 - 2x + x^2) = (-1)^{13 \cdot 12 / 2} \cdot 13^{13} \cdot 1^{12} \cdot (-2)^{11}
\]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[
\text{Res}(x^{13} - 1, 2 - 2x + x^2) = (-1)^{78} \cdot 13^{13} \cdot (-2)^{11} = 13^{13} \cdot 2^{11}
\]

Since \((-1)^{78} = 1\), we have:
\[
\text{Res}(x^{13} - 1, 2 - 2x + x^2) = 13^{13} \cdot 2^{11}
\]

Thus, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is:

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed by connecting the vertices of a dodecagon (12-sided polygon), we need to consider the properties of a rectangle. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides from the dodecagon. This means we need to choose 2 out of the 6 possible pairs of opposite sides.

First, let's identify the pairs of opposite sides in a dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 vertices, and each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices. The pairs of opposite sides are:
1. (1,2) and (7,8)
2. (2,3) and (8,9)
3. (3,4) and (9,10)
4. (4,5) and (10,11)
5. (5,6) and (11,12)
6. (6,1) and (12,1)

There are 6 such pairs of opposite sides. To form a rectangle, we need to choose 2 out of these 6 pairs. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection.

The combination formula is:
\[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]

In this case, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 2 \):
\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4!}{2 \times 1 \times 4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed by connecting the vertices of a dodecagon is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",315,"[315, '315']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that meets the given conditions and then calculate the sum of the squares of these integers. Let's break down the conditions and solve step by step.

1. **Sum of the elements is 30.**
2. **The mode is 9.**
3. **The median is a positive integer and is equal to the number of elements in the list.**

Let's denote the number of elements in the list by \( n \). Since the median is a positive integer and is equal to the number of elements, \( n \) must be an odd number. Let's start with the smallest possible odd number, which is 5.

### Case \( n = 5 \)
If \( n = 5 \), the median is the third element when the list is sorted. Let's denote the list by \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \) where \( a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq a_4 \leq a_5 \). The median is \( a_3 \), so \( a_3 = 5 \). The mode is 9, so 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Since 9 is the mode and there are only 5 numbers, 9 must appear at least twice. Let's try \( a_2 = 9 \) and \( a_4 = 9 \). Then the list is \( a_1, 9, 5, 9, a_5 \). The sum of the elements is \( a_1 + 9 + 5 + 9 + a_5 = 30 \), so \( a_1 + a_5 = 7 \). Since \( a_1 \) and \( a_5 \) are positive integers and \( a_1 \leq 5 \leq a_5 \), the only possible values are \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_5 = 6 \). Therefore, the list is \( 1, 5, 5, 9, 9 \).

Now, let's check if this list meets all the conditions:
- The sum of the elements is \( 1 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 30 \).
- The mode is 9, which appears twice.
- The median is 5, which is equal to the number of elements in the list.

All conditions are satisfied. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the elements in the list:
\[ 1^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 25 + 25 + 81 + 81 = 213. \]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of all the elements in the list is \(\boxed{213}\).","[213, '213']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a 3x3 grid of digits such that the sum of the digits in each row and each column is 999, and the sum of the digits in each of the two diagonals is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline

We are given the following conditions:
1. \(a + b + c = 999\)
2. \(d + e + f = 999\)
3. \(g + h + i = 999\)
4. \(a + d + g = 999\)

6. \(c + f + i = 999\)

1. \(0 + 0 + 8 = 8\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
2. \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
3. \(81 + 9 + 0 = 90\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
4. \(0 + 9 + 81 = 90\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
5. \(0 + 9 + 9 = 18\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
6. \(8 + 1 + 0 = 9\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
7. \(0 + 9 + 0 = 9\) (not 99, so this grid is incorrect)
8. \(8 + 9 + 81 = 98\) (not 99, so this grid is incorrect)

Since the given example does not satisfy the conditions, we need to find a correct solution. Let's try a different approach. We can start by assuming that the digits are in a specific pattern that satisfies all the conditions. One possible solution is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
81 & 9 & 0 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\

Let's check if this grid satisfies all the conditions:
1. \(81 + 9 + 0 = 90\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
2. \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
3. \(8 + 9 + 91 = 108\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
4. \(81 + 9 + 8 = 98\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
5. \(9 + 9 + 9 = 27\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
6. \(0 + 1 + 91 = 92\) (not 999, so this grid is incorrect)
7. \(0 + 9 + 8 = 17\) (not 99, so this grid is incorrect)
8. \(8 + 9 + 81 = 98\) (not 99, so this grid is incorrect)

After trying different patterns, we find that the correct solution is:

"To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by rewriting each equation in exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

From these equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other. First, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{(xyz)^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12} = 2^{13/12}
\]

So we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(x^4 y^3 z^2\). We can express \(x^4 y^3 z^2\) in terms of \(xyz\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (xyz)^{4/12} \cdot (xyz)^{3/12} \cdot (xyz)^{2/12} = (xyz)^{9/12} = (xyz)^{3/4}
\]

Substituting \(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\) into the expression, we get:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = \left(2^{-13/12}\right)^{3/4} = 2^{-13/12 \cdot 3/4} = 2^{-39/48} = 2^{-13/16}
\]

We need to find the absolute value of \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| \log_2(2^{-13/16}) \right| = \left| -\frac{13}{16} \right| = \frac{13}{16}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{13}{16}\) is already in its simplest form, so \(m = 13\) and \(n = 16\). Therefore, \(m + n = 13 + 16 = 29\).

"To determine the length of the sides of the hexagon \(ABCDEF\), we need to use the fact that the hexagon is inscribed in a circle and that the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are parallel. This implies that the hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids by a line passing through the center of the circle and parallel to \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\).

Let's denote the center of the circle as \(O\) and the radius of the circle as \(R\). The perpendicular distances from the center \(O\) to the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are equal because the hexagon is symmetric. Let's call these distances \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) respectively. Since \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are parallel and the hexagon is symmetric, the distances \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) are equal to the distances from the center to the opposite sides of the hexagon.

The length of a chord in a circle can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Chord length} = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d^2} \]
where \(d\) is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord.

For side \(AB\), the length is 200, so:
\[ 200 = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d_1^2} \]
\[ 100 = \sqrt{R^2 - d_1^2} \]
\[ 10000 = R^2 - d_1^2 \]
\[ R^2 = 10000 + d_1^2 \]

For side \(CD\), the length is 240, so:
\[ 240 = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d_2^2} \]
\[ 120 = \sqrt{R^2 - d_2^2} \]
\[ 14400 = R^2 - d_2^2 \]
\[ R^2 = 14400 + d_2^2 \]

For side \(EF\), the length is 300, so:
\[ 300 = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d_3^2} \]
\[ 150 = \sqrt{R^2 - d_3^2} \]
\[ 22500 = R^2 - d_3^2 \]
\[ R^2 = 22500 + d_3^2 \]

Since \(d_1 = d_2 = d_3\), we can set the expressions for \(R^2\) equal to each other:
\[ 10000 + d_1^2 = 14400 + d_2^2 = 22500 + d_3^2 \]

From \(10000 + d_1^2 = 14400 + d_2^2\), we get:
\[ d_2^2 = d_1^2 - 4400 \]

From \(10000 + d_1^2 = 22500 + d_3^2\), we get:
\[ d_3^2 = d_1^2 - 12500 \]

Since \(d_1 = d_2 = d_3\), we can substitute \(d_2\) and \(d_3\) in terms of \(d_1\):
\[ d_1^2 = d_1^2 - 4400 \]
\[ d_1^2 = d_1^2 - 12500 \]

This is a contradiction unless we realize that the distances are the same, so we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides divided by 4:
\[ 3d_1^2 = \frac{200^2 + 240^2 + 300^2}{4} \]
\[ 3d_1^2 = \frac{40000 + 57600 + 90000}{4} \]
\[ 3d_1^2 = \frac{187600}{4} \]
\[ 3d_1^2 = 46900 \]
\[ d_1^2 = \frac{46900}{3} \]
\[ d_1 = \sqrt{\frac{46900}{3}} \]

Now, we can find \(R^2\):
\[ R^2 = 10000 + d_1^2 \]
\[ R^2 = 10000 + \frac{46900}{3} \]
\[ R^2 = \frac{30000 + 46900}{3} \]
\[ R^2 = \frac{76900}{3} \]

Finally, we can find the length of the other sides using the same formula:
\[ \text{Length of side} = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d_1^2} \]
\[ \text{Length of side} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{76900}{3} - \frac{46900}{3}} \]
\[ \text{Length of side} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{29000}{3}} \]
\[ \text{Length of side} = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{29000}}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ \text{Length of side} = \frac{2 \sqrt{29000}}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ \text{Length of side} = \frac{2 \cdot 10 \sqrt{290}}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ \text{Length of side} = \frac{20 \sqrt{290}}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ \text{Length of side} = \frac{20 \sqrt{870}}{3} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the sets \(A\) and \(B\). The problem states that the largest element in \(B\) corresponds to the smallest element in \(A\), and the sum of the elements in \(A\) is 2024. We need to find the number of elements in \(A\).

Let's denote the elements of \(A\) as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n\). The largest element in \(B\) is \(a_n\). Since \(B\) contains all positive integers that are not in \(A\), the elements of \(B\) are \(1, 2, \ldots, a_n-1, a_n+1, a_n+2, \ldots\).

The sum of the elements in \(A\) is given as 2024. To find the number of elements in \(A\), we need to consider the smallest possible values for \(a_n\) such that the sum of the first \(n\) positive integers minus the sum of the elements in \(A\) is a valid set \(B\).

The sum of the first \(a_n\) positive integers is:
\[

Since \(B\) contains all positive integers except those in \(A\), the sum of the elements in \(B\) must be the sum of the first \(a_n\) positive integers minus the sum of the elements in \(A\). However, since \(B\) contains all positive integers except those in \(A\), the sum of the elements in \(B\) is the sum of all positive integers minus the sum of the elements in \(A\).

Given that the sum of the elements in \(A\) is 2024, we need to find \(a_n\) such that the sum of the first \(a_n\) positive integers minus 2024 is a valid sum for \(B\). The smallest possible value for \(a_n\) is 64 because:
\[
\frac{64 \cdot 65}{2} = 2080
\]
and
\[
2080 - 2024 = 56

This means that the elements of \(A\) are the first 63 positive integers and 65, and the sum of the elements in \(A\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( Q \) and \( R \) when the number \( N \) is divided by 1000, and then find the sum \( Q + R \).

- \( Q \) and \( R \) are the quotient and remainder, respectively, when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

First, let's understand the property of \( N \). For any positive integer \( k \), when \( N \) is divided by \( k \), the remainder is \( k - 1 \). This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ N \equiv k - 1 \pmod{k} \]
This implies:
\[ N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{k} \]

The only such number is 0, but since \( N \) is positive, the next smallest number that fits this criterion is the least common multiple (LCM) of all positive integers. However, the LCM of all positive integers does not exist as a finite number. Instead, we consider the smallest number that fits the pattern for practical purposes, which is the product of the first few integers that cover the range of typical divisors we might consider in such problems.

For practical purposes, we can consider the LCM of the first few integers, but since the problem specifies the largest \( N \) such that the remainder is \( k - 1 \) for all \( k \), we can infer that \( N \) is a very large number that fits this pattern. The problem states that the largest such \( N \) is 999, which fits the pattern perfectly because:
\[ 999 \equiv k - 1 \pmod{k} \]
for all \( k \) from 1 to 1000.

Now, we need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when 999 is divided by 1000. This is a straightforward division:
\[ 999 = 1000 \cdot 0 + 999 \]
So, \( Q = 0 \) and \( R = 999 \).

Finally, we need to find the sum \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 0 + 999 = 999 \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{999} \]","[999, '999']",699,"[699, '699']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles that are tangent to the sphere \( S \) and the torus \( T \), and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's analyze the geometry of the problem. The torus \( T \) is a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. This means the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the generating circle is 6 units, and the radius of the generating circle is 3 units.

The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11 units. When the torus is inscribed in the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus is 6 units. The radius of the generating circle of the torus is 3 units, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the surface of the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units. Since the radius of the sphere is 11 units, the distance from the surface of the torus to the surface of the sphere is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) units. This means the radius of the circle that is tangent to the sphere and the torus is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) units.

When the torus is circumscribed by the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units. The radius of the generating circle of the torus is 3 units, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the surface of the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units. Since the radius of the sphere is 11 units, the distance from the surface of the torus to the surface of the sphere is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) units. This means the radius of the circle that is tangent to the sphere and the torus is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) units.

The difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \). Therefore, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) can be written as \( \frac{22}{1} \), where \( m = 22 \) and \( n = 1 \). The sum \( m + n \) is \( 22 + 1 = 23 \).

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{23}\).","[23, '23']",127,"[127, '127']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place the b square tiles in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains exactly one b square tile, and each row and each column contains exactly one b square tile. This is a classic problem in combinatorics known as the number of permutations of a set.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to place 25 b square tiles in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one b square tile. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 5 distinct objects (since each row and each column must have exactly one b square tile).

2. **Calculate the Number of Permutations**: The number of permutations of 5 distinct objects is given by \(5!\) (5 factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to 5.
   \[
   5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
   \]

3. **Conclusion**: The number of ways to place the b square tiles in the \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one b square tile is \(120\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",902,"[902, '902']",False
