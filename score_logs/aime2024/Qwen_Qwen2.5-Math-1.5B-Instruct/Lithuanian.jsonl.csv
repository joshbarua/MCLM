"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Kiekvienas to walk the same distance as Aya, given the conditions provided. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aya walks:**
   - Aya walks at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour.
   - Aya walks for \( t \) minutes.
   - Convert \( t \) minutes to hours: \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours.
   - Distance Aya walks: \( s \times \frac{t}{60} = \frac{st}{60} \) kilometers.

2. **Determine the distance Kiekvienas walks:**
   - Kiekvienas walks at a speed of \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour.
   - Kiekvienas walks for \( t - 24 \) minutes.
   - Convert \( t - 24 \) minutes to hours: \( \frac{t - 24}{60} \) hours.
   - Distance Kiekvienas walks: \( (s + 2) \times \frac{t - 24}{60} = \frac{(s + 2)(t - 24)}{60} \) kilometers.

3. **Set up the equation for the distances:**
   - Since both Kiekvienas and Aya walk the same distance, we set their distances equal to each other:
     \[
     \frac{st}{60} = \frac{(s + 2)(t - 24)}{60}
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by 60 to clear the denominators:
     \[
     st = (s + 2)(t - 24)
     \]
   - Expand the right-hand side:
     \[
     st = st - 24s + 2t - 48
     \]
   - Subtract \( st \) from both sides:
     \[
     0 = -24s + 2t - 48
     \]
   - Rearrange to solve for \( t \):
     \[
     2t = 24s + 48
     \]
     \[
     t = 12s + 24
     \]

5. **Determine the distance Kiekvienas walks in terms of \( s \) and \( t \):**
   - Substitute \( t = 12s + 24 \) into the distance formula for K pastoviu:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \frac{(s + 2)(12s + 24 - 24)}{60} = \frac{(s + 2) \cdot 12s}{60} = \frac{12s(s + 2)}{60} = \frac{s(s + 2)}{5}
     \]

6. **Determine the time it takes for K pastoviu to walk the same distance at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour:**
   - Let \( T \) be the time in hours.
   - Distance K pastoviu walks: \( \left( s + \frac{1}{2} \right) T \)
   - Set this equal to the distance K pastoviu walked:
     \[
     \left( s + \frac{1}{2} \right) T = \frac{s(s + 2)}{5}
     \]
   - Solve for \( T \):
     \[
     T = \frac{\frac{s(s + 2)}{5}}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{s(s + 2)}{5(s + \frac{1}{2})}
     \]
   - Simplify the denominator:
     \[
     s + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2s + 1}{2}
     \]
     \[
     T = \frac{s(s + 2)}{5 \cdot \frac{2s + 1}{2}} = \frac{2s(s + 2)}{5(2s + 1)}
     \]

7. **Convert \( T \) from hours to minutes:**
   - Multiply \( T \) by 60:
     \[
     t_{\text{minutes}} = 60 \times \frac{2s(s + 2)}{5(2s + 1)} = \frac{12s(s + 2)}{2s + 1}
     \]

Thus, the time it takes for K pastoviu to walk the same distance as Aya, given the conditions, is \(\boxed{\frac{12s(s + 2)}{2s + 1}}\) minutes.","[(12*s*(s + 2))/(2*s + 1), '\\frac{12s(s + 2)}{2s + 1}']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). We will use the properties of the circumcircle and the power of a point theorem.

First, we need to find the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\). The formula for the circumradius \(R\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
\[ R = \frac{abc}{4K} \]
where \(K\) is the area of the triangle. We can find the area \(K\) using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \(s\) of the triangle is:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12 \]
The area \(K\) is:
\[ K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14} \]
Now, we can find the circumradius \(R\):
\[ R = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56} \]

Next, we use the power of a point theorem. The power of point \(A\) with respect to the circumcircle is given by:
\[ AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC \]
Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents from \(A\) to the circumcircle, \(AD\) is the length of the tangent from \(A\) to the circumcircle. The length of the tangent from a point to a circle is given by:
\[ AD = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2} \]
Now, we can find \(AP\):
\[ AP \cdot 5\sqrt{2} = 5 \cdot 10 \]
\[ AP = \frac{50}{5\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2} \]
Thus, \(AP = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2}\). The fraction \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}\) can be simplified to \(\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}\), but in the form of a fraction, it is \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}\).

The fraction \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}\) can be simplified to \(\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}\), but in the form of a fraction, it is \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}\).

Therefore, the value of \(m + n\) is:
\[ m + n = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]","[12, '12']",113,"[113, '113']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( m+n \) where \( \frac{m}{n} \) is the ratio of the number of square units in the area of a square to the number of square units in the perimeter of the square. Let's go through the steps in detail.

1. **Identify the area and perimeter of a square:**
   - If the side length of the square is \( s \), then the area \( A \) of the square is \( s^2 \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) of the square is \( 4s \).

2. **Form the ratio of the area to the perimeter:**
   - The ratio of the area to the perimeter is \( \frac{s^2}{4s} = \frac{s}{4} \).
   - This ratio is a fraction in its simplest form, where the numerator \( m \) is \( s \) and the denominator \( n \) is 4.

3. **Determine the values of \( m \) and \( n \):**
   - Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), \( s \) must be 4 (the smallest positive integer that makes \( m \) and \( n \) coprime).
   - Therefore, \( m = 4 \) and \( n = 4 \).

4. **Calculate \( m+n \):**
   - \( m+n = 4+4 = 8 \).

Thus, the value of \( m+n \) is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then use them to find the graphs of the given equations.

First, let's analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):

1. The function \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) can be broken down as follows:
   - For \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).
   - For \( |x| < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).

2. The function \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \) can be broken down as follows:
   - For \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).
   - For \( |x| < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).

Now, let's analyze the given equations:

1. The equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):
   - First, we need to find \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \). Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the values of \( f \) in this range.
   - For \( \sin(2\pi x) \) in the interval \([-1, -\frac{1}{2}) \cup (\frac{1}{2}, 1]\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \).
   - For \( \sin(2\pi x) \) in the interval \([- \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
   - Now, we need to find \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \). Since \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\), we use the second case of \( g \), which is \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \) for \( x \) in this range.
   - Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).
   - Finally, \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \right) = 1 - 4 f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).

2. The equation \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):
   - First, we need to find \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \). Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the values of \( f \) in this range.
   - For \( \cos(3\pi y) \) in the interval \([-1, -\frac{1}{2}) \cup (\frac{1}{2}, 1]\), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \).
   - For \( \cos(3\pi y) \) in the interval \([- \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3\pi y)| \).
   - Therefore, \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

   - Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \).
   - Finally, \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \right) = 1 - 4 f(\cos(3\pi y)) \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to one of its faces. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the tetrahedron meet, and it is equidistant from all four faces of the tetrahedron.

First, we need to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \). The volume of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

For our tetrahedron, the edge lengths are \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \). Plugging these values into the determinant, we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 89 & 41 & 0

Calculating this determinant, we find:

\[
288 V^2 = 288 \times 240
\]

\[
V^2 = 240
\]

\[
V = \sqrt{240} = 4\sqrt{15}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of one of the faces of the tetrahedron. Let's consider the face \( \triangle ABC \). The area of a triangle with sides \( a, b, c \) can be found using Heron's formula:

\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]

For \( \triangle ABC \), the sides are \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), and \( c = \sqrt{89} \). The semi-perimeter \( s \) is:

\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

\[
A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

However, we can use the fact that the tetrahedron is symmetric and the area of each face is the same. The area of \( \triangle ABC \) can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with given sides:

\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{4a^2b^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2}
\]

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{4 \times 41 \times 80 - (41 + 80 - 89)^2}
\]

\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{13120 - 100}
\]

\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{13020}
\]

\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \times 2\sqrt{3255}
\]

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3255}}{2}
\]

The distance from the incenter to one of the faces is given by:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{A}
\]

Substituting the values of \( V \) and \( A \):

\[
d = \frac{3 \times 4\sqrt{15}}{\frac{\sqrt{3255}}{2}}
\]

\[
d = \frac{24\sqrt{15}}{\sqrt{3255}}
\]

\[
d = \frac{24\sqrt{15}}{\sqrt{15 \times 217}}
\]

\[
d = \frac{24\sqrt{15}}{\sqrt{15} \times \sqrt{217}}
\]

\[
d = \frac{24}{\sqrt{217}}
\]

Rationalizing the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{24\sqrt{217}}{217}
\]

Thus, the distance from the incenter to one of the faces is:

\[
d = \frac{24\sqrt{217}}{217}
\]

The values of \( m, n, \) and \( p \) are 24, 217, and 217, respectively. Therefore, \( m + n + p = 24 + 217 + 217 = 458 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{458}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius \( r \) of the sphere that can be inscribed in the parallelogram \(\mathcal{B}\) and then find \( r^2 \) in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. Finally, we need to find \( p + q \).

First, let's recall some properties of a parallelogram and its inscribed circle. For a circle to be inscribed in a parallelogram, the parallelogram must be a rhombus or a square. However, since the problem does not specify that \(\mathcal{B}\) is a rhombus or a square, we will assume it is a general parallelogram with an inscribed circle.

The area \( A \) of a parallelogram can be expressed in terms of its base \( b \), height \( h \), and the radius \( r \) of the inscribed circle as:
\[ A = b \cdot h = 2r \cdot s \]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the parallelogram. The semiperimeter \( s \) is given by:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c + d}{2} \]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram. However, we can also use the fact that the area of the parallelogram can be expressed as:
\[ A = a \cdot h \]
where \( a \) is the length of one of the sides and \( h \) is the height corresponding to that side. Given that the area \( A \) is 54 and the semiperimeter \( s \) is half the perimeter, we can use the relationship:
\[ A = 2r \cdot s \]
Since the semiperimeter \( s \) is not directly given, we can use the fact that the area can also be expressed as:
\[ A = a \cdot h \]
and the height \( h \) can be related to the radius \( r \) of the inscribed circle by:
\[ h = 2r \]
Thus, we have:
\[ A = a \cdot 2r \]
Since the area \( A \) is 54, we can write:
\[ 54 = a \cdot 2r \]
or
\[ r = \frac{54}{2a} = \frac{27}{a} \]
We also know that the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides of the parallelogram is equal to the perimeter divided by 2, so:
\[ a + b = \text{perimeter}/2 \]
However, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides of the parallelogram is equal to the perimeter divided by 2, so:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each logarithmic expression using the properties of logarithms. Recall that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property, we get:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

From the first equation, we can solve for \(\log_x(y)\):

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10 \implies \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \(\log_y(x)\):

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10 \implies \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Next, we use the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that \(\log_b(a) = \frac{1}{\log_a(b)}\). Applying this to \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\), we get:

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}
\]

Substituting the expressions we found for \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\):

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Now, we solve for \(y\) by cross-multiplying:

\[
10 \cdot 5 = x \cdot 2y \implies 50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of people \( n \) and the total number of points \( P \) such that the conditions of the problem are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are \( n \) people.
   - Each person can either get 1 point or 4 points.
   - The total number of points \( P \) must be 2024.
   - We need to find the number of people \( n \) and the total number of points \( P \) such that the conditions are satisfied.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of people who get 1 point, and \( y \) be the number of people who get 4 points. We have two equations:
   \[
   x + y = n
   \]
   \[
   x + 4y = 2024
   \]

3. **Solving the System of Equations:**
   We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (x + 4y) - (x + y) = 2024 - n
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   3y = 2024 - n
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{2024 - n}{3}
   \]

4. **Ensuring \( y \) is an Integer:**
   For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 2024 - n \) must be divisible by 3. Therefore, we need:
   \[
   2024 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}
   \]
   Simplifying \( 2024 \mod 3 \):
   \[
   2024 \div 3 = 674 \text{ remainder } 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2024 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
   \]
   So, we need:
   \[
   2 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
   \]

5. **Finding the Smallest \( n \):**
   The smallest \( n \) that satisfies \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \) is \( n = 2 \). However, we need to check if this value is feasible:
   \[
   y = \frac{2024 - 2}{3} = \frac{2022}{3} = 674
   \]
   \[
   x = n - y = 2 - 674 = -672 \quad \text{(not possible since \( x \) must be non-negative)}
   \]

   We need to find the next smallest \( n \) that satisfies \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \). Let's try \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   y = \frac{2024 - 5}{3} = \frac{2019}{3} = 673
   \]
   \[
   x = n - y = 5 - 673 = -668 \quad \text{(not possible)}
   \]

   Continuing this process, we find that the smallest \( n \) that works is \( n = 2024 \):
   \[
   y = \frac{2024 - 2024}{3} = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = n - y = 2024 - 0 = 2024
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The smallest \( n \) that satisfies the conditions is \( n = 2024 \). Therefore, the total number of points \( P \) is 2024.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the two smallest numbers among the four chosen numbers is less than the sum of the two largest numbers. Let's denote the four chosen numbers as \(a < b < c < d\). We need to find the probability that \(a + b < c + d\).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{10}{4}\):

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \(a + b < c + d\). To do this, we will consider the complementary case where \(a + b \geq c + d\) and subtract it from the total number of outcomes.

If \(a + b \geq c + d\), then \(a + b\) must be at least as large as the sum of the two largest numbers. Let's analyze the possible values for \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\):

1. If \(a + b = c + d\), then \(a + b\) must be the sum of the two largest numbers. The only way this can happen is if \(a + b = 11\) (since the largest possible sum of two numbers from 1 to 10 is 19, and the only pair that sums to 11 is (5, 6)). The pairs \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\) must be \((1, 10), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6)\). There are 5 such pairs, and for each pair, there is exactly one way to choose the other pair. Therefore, there are \(5\) favorable outcomes for \(a + b = c + d\).

2. If \(a + b > c + d\), then \(a + b\) must be greater than the sum of the two largest numbers. The only way this can happen is if \(a + b \geq 12\). We need to count the number of ways to choose \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) such that \(a + b \geq 12\). The possible pairs \((a, b)\) are \((2, 10), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 8), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 9), (9, 10), (10, 10)\). However, we need to ensure that \(c\) and \(d\) are chosen from the remaining numbers such that \(c + d < a + b\). This is a more complex combinatorial problem, but we can use symmetry to simplify it. The number of ways to choose \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) such that \(a + b > c + d\) is the same as the number of ways to choose \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) such that \(a + b < c + d\). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for \(a + b > c + d\) is the same as the number of favorable outcomes for \(a + b < c + d\).

Since the total number of outcomes is 210, and the number of outcomes where \(a + b = c + d\) is 5, the number of outcomes where \(a + b \neq c + d\) is \(210 - 5 = 205\). Since the number of outcomes where \(a + b > c + d\) is the same as the number of outcomes where \(a + b < c + d\), the number of favorable outcomes for \(a + b < c + d\) is \(\frac{205}{2} = 102.5\). Since the number of outcomes must be an integer, we round down to 102.

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two smallest numbers is less than the sum of the two largest numbers is:

\[
\frac{105}{210} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability that the sum of the two smallest numbers is greater than the sum of the two largest numbers is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two smallest numbers is less than the sum of the two largest numbers is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cyclic quadrilateral:**
   Since \(A, D, H, G\) form a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). Also, since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) lies on the line segment \(DC\).

2. **Use the given lengths:**
   We are given the lengths \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\). We need to find the length of \(CE\).

3. **Apply the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   Since \(E\) lies on the line segment \(DC\), we can use the Power of a Point Theorem. The Power of a Point Theorem states that for a point \(E\) on the line segment \(DC\), the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other secant. In this case, the secants are \(AB\) and \(FG\).

   Let \(CE = x\). Then, since \(E\) is on \(DC\), we have:
   \[
   AB \cdot AD = FG \cdot FH
   \]
   However, we need to find a relationship involving \(CE\). Since \(E\) is on \(DC\), we can use the fact that \(E\) divides \(DC\) into two segments, and the length of \(CE\) can be found using the given lengths and the properties of the cyclic quadrilateral.

4. **Use the given lengths to find \(CE\):**
   Since \(E\) is on \(DC\), we can use the fact that the length of \(CE\) is part of the total length of \(DC\). We know that \(BC = 16\) and \(AB = 107\), and we need to find the length of \(CE\). Since \(E\) is on \(DC\), we can use the fact that the length of \(CE\) is part of the total length of \(DC\).

   Given that \(FG = 17\) and \(EF = 184\), we can use the fact that the length of \(CE\) is part of the total length of \(DC\). Since \(E\) is on \(DC\), we can use the fact that the length of \(CE\) is part of the total length of \(DC\).

   Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of points where the lines intersect in an \(8 \times 8\) grid. The lines are the vertical and horizontal lines that form the grid.

1. **Count the number of vertical lines:**
   - In an \(8 \times 8\) grid, there are 9 vertical lines (one more than the number of columns).

2. **Count the number of horizontal lines:**
   - Similarly, there are 9 horizontal lines (one more than the number of rows).

3. **Calculate the number of intersection points:**
   - Each intersection point is formed by the intersection of one vertical line and one horizontal line.
   - Therefore, the total number of intersection points is the product of the number of vertical lines and the number of horizontal lines.

\[
\text{Total number of intersection points} = 9 \times 9 = 81

"To solve the given expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) for some real number \(\theta\). This is because \(|z| = 4\) means that \(z\) lies on a circle of radius 4 in the complex plane.

First, we substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}}.
\]
Simplifying the second term, we get:
\[
\frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96+144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta} = 300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta} + 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}.
\]
We can group the terms involving \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\):
\[
300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta} + 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Next, we use the fact that \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]
Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta).
\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(336\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta).
\]
We can factor out the common factors:
\[
324(\cos\theta - \frac{4}{3}\sin\theta) + i(336\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta).
\]
Notice that the expression inside the parentheses can be simplified by recognizing that the coefficients of \(\cos\theta\) and \(\sin\theta\) are proportional. Specifically, we can factor out 36:
\[
36(9(\cos\theta - \frac{4}{3}\sin\theta) + 9(8\cos\theta + 8\sin\theta)) = 36(9\cos\theta - 12\sin\theta + 8\cos\theta + 8\sin\theta) = 36(17\cos\theta - 4\sin\theta).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression is purely real because the imaginary part must cancel out. By symmetry and the properties of complex numbers, the imaginary part will cancel out, leaving us with a real number. To find this real number, we can use the fact that the expression is symmetric and the coefficients of the imaginary parts are proportional. By direct substitution of specific values of \(\theta\) (such as \(\theta = 0\) or \(\theta = \pi/2\)), we can verify that the imaginary part indeed cancels out, leaving us with:
\[
36 \times 9 = 324.
\]
Thus, the value of the expression is:

\boxed{324}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of the area of triangle \(ABC\) to the area of the circumcircle of triangle \(ABC\). Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\) is 34.
   - The inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is 1.
   - The area of the circumcircle of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\pi R^2 = \pi \times 34^2 = 1156\pi\).

2. **Use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its circumradius and inradius:**
   The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be expressed as:
   \[
   K = r \times s
   \]
   where \(s\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. However, we can also use the formula:
   \[
   K = \frac{abc}{4R}
   \]
   where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the sides of the triangle. But we don't need the specific sides to find the ratio of the areas.

3. **Calculate the area of triangle \(ABC\):**
   The area of triangle \(ABC\) can also be expressed as:
   \[
   K = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{abc}{4 \times 34} = \frac{abc}{136}
   \]
   However, we can use the simpler relationship involving the inradius and the semiperimeter:
   \[
   K = r \times s = 1 \times s = s
   \]
   So, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(s\).

4. **Find the ratio of the area of triangle \(ABC\) to the area of its circumcircle:**
   The ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{K}{\text{Area of circumcircle}} = \frac{s}{1156\pi}
   \]
   Since we don't have the specific value of \(s\), we can use the relationship between the area, the inradius, and the circumradius. The area of the triangle can also be expressed as:
   \[
   K = r \times s = 1 \times s = s
   \]
   And the area of the circumcircle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of circumcircle} = \pi R^2 = 1156\pi
   \]
   So the ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{K}{\text{Area of circumcircle}} = \frac{1 \times s}{1156\pi} = \frac{s}{1156\pi}
   \]
   Since \(s = K\) and \(K = r \times s = 1 \times s = s\), we have:
   \[
   \frac{K}{\text{Area of circumcircle}} = \frac{1 \times s}{1156\pi} = \frac{s}{1156\pi}
   \]
   The ratio simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{K}{\text{Area of circumcircle}} = \frac{1 \times s}{1156\pi} = \frac{s}{1156\pi}
   \]
   Since \(s = K\) and \(K = r \times s = 1 \times s = s\), we have:
   \[
   \frac{K}{\text{Area of circumcircle}} = \frac{1 \times s}{1156\pi} = \frac{s}{1156\pi}
   \]
   The ratio simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{K}{\text{Area of circumcircle}} = \frac{1 \times s}{1156\pi} = \frac{s}{1156\pi}
   \]

5. **Determine the values of \(m\) and \(n\):**
   The ratio \(\frac{K}{\text{Area of circumcircle}}\) is \(\frac{1}{1156}\), so \(m = 1\) and \(n = 1156\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 1156 = 1157\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) such that the diagonals of the rectangle are equal and bisect each other at right angles. The diagonals of the rectangle are the diameters of the hyperbola, and the center of the hyperbola is the origin \((0,0)\).

The vertices of the rectangle will be of the form \((\pm a, \pm b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the hyperbola, respectively. For the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), the semi-major axis \(a = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\) and the semi-minor axis \(b = \sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{6}\).

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) of the rectangle is given by the distance between the points \((2\sqrt{5}, 2\sqrt{6})\) and \((-2\sqrt{5}, -2\sqrt{6})\). The distance formula gives us:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{5} - (-2\sqrt{5}))^2 + (2\sqrt{6} - (-2\sqrt{6}))^2} = \sqrt{(4\sqrt{5})^2 + (4\sqrt{6})^2} = \sqrt{80 + 96} = \sqrt{176} = 4\sqrt{11}

Thus, \(BD^2 = (4\sqrt{11})^2 = 16 \times 11 = 176\).

"To solve for \(AB \cdot AC\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with the properties described, we need to use the properties of the incenter and the excenter of a triangle. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The incenter \(I\) and the excenter \(O\) of \(\triangle ABC\) are such that \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\).
   - The inradius \(r\) is 6.
   - The exradius \(r_A\) (the radius of the excircle opposite to vertex \(A\)) is 13.

2. **Use the relationship between the inradius, exradius, and the sides of the triangle:**
   The relationship between the inradius \(r\), the exradius \(r_A\), and the sides of the triangle is given by:
   \[
   r_A = \frac{A}{s-a}
   \]
   where \(A\) is the area of the triangle, \(s\) is the semiperimeter, and \(a\) is the length of side \(BC\). The inradius \(r\) is given by:
   \[
   r = \frac{A}{s}
   \]
   From these, we can derive the following relationship:
   \[
   r_A = \frac{s}{s-a} \cdot r
   \]
   Substituting the given values \(r = 6\) and \(r_A = 13\), we get:
   \[
   13 = \frac{s}{s-a} \cdot 6
   \]
   Solving for \(s\) in terms of \(a\):
   \[
   13(s-a) = 6s \implies 13s - 13a = 6s \implies 7s = 13a \implies s = \frac{13a}{7}
   \]

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the incenter, excenter, and the point of tangency:**
   Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle OIA\):
   \[
   OI^2 + IA^2 = OA^2
   \]
   Here, \(OA\) is the distance from the excenter to the vertex, which is equal to the exradius \(r_A = 13\). The distance \(IA\) is the inradius \(r = 6\). Therefore:
   \[
   OI^2 + 6^2 = 13^2 \implies OI^2 + 36 = 169 \implies OI^2 = 133 \implies OI = \sqrt{133}
   \]

4. **Use the formula for the product of the sides \(AB\) and \(AC\):**
   The product of the sides \(AB\) and \(AC\) can be found using the formula:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = s \cdot r
   \]
   Substituting the values of \(s\) and \(r\):
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = \frac{13a}{7} \cdot 6 = \frac{78a}{7}
   \]
   However, we need to find the actual value of \(a\). Since we don't have the exact value of \(a\), we can use the fact that the product \(AB \cdot AC\) is directly related to the inradius and the exradius. The correct value of \(AB \cdot AC\) is:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = 156

"Given the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We know from the problem statement that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]
So, we can substitute this into the equation:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]

Now, let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equation for \(abc\), we get:
\[abc = 100 \cdot 100 \cdot 100 = 1,000,000.\]
And substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equation \(100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\), we get:
\[100(100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100) - 1,000,000 = 100 \cdot 30,000 - 1,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000.\]
This satisfies the equation, so the values \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 100\) are correct.

Therefore, the solution is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) and then calculate \(OC^2\).

First, let's determine the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write the equation of the line passing through \(A\) and \(B\) as:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
The point \(C\) lies on this line and also on the circle with radius 1 centered at the origin (since the segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is a chord of the unit circle and the segment \(\overline{AB}\) is a chord of the unit circle). The equation of the unit circle is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the circle's equation, we get:
\[
x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4 \implies 16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\):
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Since \(C\) is in the first quadrant, we take the positive root:
\[
x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\) back into the equation of the line to find \(y\):
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)\). Now, we calculate \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2}{64}

Expanding the squares:
\[
(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 = 9 + 6\sqrt{13} + 13 = 22 + 6\sqrt{13}
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2 = 3 - 2\sqrt{117} + 39 = 42 - 6\sqrt{13}
\]
Adding these together:
\[
22 + 6\sqrt{13} + 42 - 6\sqrt{13} = 64
\]
Thus:
\[
OC^2 = \frac{64}{64} = 1
\]
Since \(OC^2 = \frac{3}{4}\), we have \(p = 3\) and \(q = 4\), so \(p + q = 7\).

The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). The non-trivial roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\) satisfy the equation \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\).

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial is related to the resultant of the two polynomials.

A number \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant if it can be written as \( n = ab + c \) where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) and \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in terms of \( b \) and \( a \):
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), so \( 0 \le a, c < b \). Also, we have:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into the equation \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \), we get:

Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sides of the polygon that can be formed by the intersection of three trapezoids. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Intersection of Trapezoids:**
   - Each trapezoid is formed by two parallel lines and two non-parallel lines.
   - When three trapezoids intersect, they can form a new polygon at their intersection.

2. **Possible Polygons Formed:**
   - The problem states that the number of sides of the polygon formed by the intersection of the three trapezoids can be either the number of sides of a dodecagon (12-sided polygon) or a triangle (3-sided polygon).

3. **Visualizing the Intersection:**
   - Consider the intersection of three trapezoids. Each trapezoid has two parallel sides and two non-parallel sides.
   - When these trapezoids intersect, they can form a new polygon by the points of intersection of their sides.

4. **Counting the Sides:**
   - To form a triangle, the intersection of the three trapezoids must result in three sides.
   - To form a dodecagon, the intersection must result in twelve sides.

5. **Determining the Number of Sides:**
   - The problem does not provide specific details about the arrangement of the trapezoids, but it implies that the intersection can form either a triangle or a dodecagon.
   - Since the problem asks for the number of sides of the polygon formed by the intersection, and it is given that the polygon can be either a triangle or a dodecagon, we need to consider both possibilities.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The problem does not specify which type of polygon is formed, so we must consider both possibilities.
   - Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon formed by the intersection of the three trapezoids can be either 3 or 12.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the elements of the set and then find the sum of their squares. Let's denote the elements of the set by \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n\). The median of the set is the middle element if \(n\) is odd, or the average of the two middle elements if \(n\) is even. The mode is the element that appears most frequently in the set.

Given:
1. The sum of the elements is 30.
2. The mode is the smallest element, which is also the median.
3. The median is the smallest element, and it is the mode.

Let's assume the set has an odd number of elements, say \(2k+1\). Then the median is the \((k+1)\)-th element, and it is also the mode. Let's denote this element by \(m\). The set can be written as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, m, a_{k+2}, \ldots, a_{2k+1}\) where \(a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_k = m\).

The sum of the elements is:
\[ka + m + \sum_{i=k+2}^{2k+1} a_i = 30.\]
Since \(a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_k = m\), we can rewrite the sum as:
\[km + m + \sum_{i=k+2}^{2k+1} a_i = 30.\]
This simplifies to:
\[(k+1)m + \sum_{i=k+2}^{2k+1} a_i = 30.\]

The mode is 9, so \(m = 9\). Substituting \(m = 9\) into the equation, we get:
\[(k+1)9 + \sum_{i=k+2}^{2k+1} a_i = 30.\]
This simplifies to:
\[9(k+1) + \sum_{i=k+2}^{2k+1} a_i = 30.\]
Since the sum of the elements is 30 and the mode is 9, the remaining elements must sum to 30 - 9(k+1). For simplicity, let's assume the set has 3 elements (the smallest odd number greater than 1). Then \(k = 1\) and the set is \(9, 9, 12\). The sum is:
\[9 + 9 + 12 = 30.\]
This satisfies the condition. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the elements:
\[9^2 + 9^2 + 12^2 = 81 + 81 + 144 = 306.\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the elements is:

We need to ensure that the sums of the rows and columns are correct. Let's start by calculating the sums of the rows and columns:

1. The sum of the first row is \(0 + 0 + 8 = 8\).
2. The sum of the second row is \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\).
3. The sum of the first column is \(0 + 9 = 9\).
4. The sum of the second column is \(0 + 9 = 9\).
5. The sum of the third column is \(8 + 1 = 9\).

We need to adjust the digits to make the sums correct. The problem states that the sums of the rows and columns should be 999 and 99, respectively. This means we need to add additional digits to the grid to make the sums correct.

Let's add the digits 991 to the first row and 99 to the second row. This will make the sums of the rows 999 and 99, respectively. Now, let's check the sums of the columns:

We need to adjust the digits in the grid to make the sums of the columns correct. The problem states that the sums of the columns should be 99 and 99, respectively. This means we need to add additional digits to the grid to make the sums correct.

1. The sum of the first column is \(0 + 9 + 9 = 18\).
2. The sum of the second column is \(0 + 9 + 9 = 18\).

\[

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}

We can rewrite these equations as:

\[
x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}
\]
\[
z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
x \cdot y \cdot z = (yz \cdot \sqrt{2}) \cdot (xz \cdot 2^{1/3}) \cdot (xy \cdot 2^{1/4})
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
xyz = (yz \cdot xz \cdot xy) \cdot (\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4})
\]
\[
xyz = (x^2 y^2 z^2) \cdot (2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4})

\[
xyz = (xyz)^2 \cdot 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}

Since \(xyz \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(xyz\):

\[

We need to find the value of the exponent of 2:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}

So, we have:

\[
1 = xyz \cdot 2^{13/12}
\]
\[
xyz = 2^{-13/12}

We need to find the value of \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2((xyz)^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}) = \log_2((2^{-13/12})^4 \cdot 2^{13/12} \cdot 2^{-13/12}) = \log_2(2^{-13/3} \cdot 2^{13/12}) = \log_2(2^{-13/3 + 13/12}) = \log_2(2^{-13/4}) = -\frac{13}{4}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the sides of the trapezoid given the lengths of the segments formed by the diagonals of the trapezoid. Let's denote the trapezoid as \(ABCD\) with \(AB\) and \(CD\) as the parallel sides, and let the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(O\). The segments formed by the diagonals are \(AO = 200\), \(BO = 240\), \(CO = 300\), and \(DO = x\).

Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the diagonals are equal in length, and the triangles formed by the diagonals and the parallel sides are similar. Therefore, the ratios of the corresponding sides of these triangles are equal. This gives us the proportion:

\[
\frac{AO}{BO} = \frac{CO}{DO}
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
\frac{200}{240} = \frac{300}{x}
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we have:

\[
\frac{5}{6} = \frac{300}{x}

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:

\[
5x = 6 \times 300
\]

\[
5x = 1800

\[
x = \frac{1800}{5}

The perimeter of the trapezoid is:

The problem states that when \(N\) is divided by 1000, the quotient is \(Q\) and the remainder is \(R\), and we need to find \(Q + R\).

Since the problem does not provide a specific value for \(N\), we can assume that \(N\) is any number that, when divided by 1000, gives a quotient \(Q\) and a remainder \(R\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the inscribed and circumscribed spheres of the tetrahedron, respectively, and express this difference as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) in simplest form. Finally, we need to find the sum \( m + n \).

First, let's recall the properties of the tetrahedron and the spheres involved. The tetrahedron has a volume \( V \), a surface area \( A \), and an inradius \( r_i \) and an circumradius \( r_o \). The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron can be expressed in terms of its inradius and surface area as:

Similarly, the volume can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the solid angle subtended by the tetrahedron at the center of the circumscribed sphere:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} r_o A \]

However, for a regular tetrahedron, the relationship between the inradius \( r_i \) and the circumradius \( r_o \) is given by:
\[ r_i = \frac{r_o}{3} \]

Given that the circumradius \( r_o \) of the sphere \( S \) is 11, we can find the inradius \( r_i \) of the tetrahedron inscribed in the sphere \( T \) (which has a radius of 3) and the inradius \( r_o \) of the tetrahedron circumscribed around the sphere \( S \) (which has a radius of 11).

The inradius \( r_i \) of the tetrahedron inscribed in the sphere \( T \) is:
\[ r_i = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \]
The inradius \( r_o \) of the tetrahedron circumscribed around the sphere \( S \) is:
\[ r_o = 11 \]

The difference between the inradius of the circumscribed sphere and the inradius of the inscribed sphere is:
\[ r_o - r_i = 11 - 1 = 10 \]

Thus, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = -10 \]

Expressing \(-10\) as a fraction in simplest form, we have:
\[ -10 = -\frac{10}{1} \]

Here, \( m = -10 \) and \( n = 1 \). The sum \( m + n \) is:
\[ m + n = -10 + 1 = -9 \]

However, since we are asked for the sum of the absolute values of \( m \) and \( n \), we have:
\[ |m| + |n| = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]","[11, '11']",127,"[127, '127']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of people who are still in the game after the described events. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - There are 25 people in the game.
   - Each person has a number of points, and the total number of points is 25.

2. **First Event:**
   - One person is eliminated, and the total number of points is reduced by the number of points that person had.
   - Let's say the person who is eliminated has \( x \) points. After elimination, the total number of points is \( 25 - x \).

3. **Second Event:**
   - The remaining 24 people are divided into two groups of 12.
   - Each group has a total of \( \frac{25 - x}{2} \) points.

4. **Third Event:**
   - One person is eliminated from each group, and the total number of points is reduced by the number of points that person had in their respective group.
   - Let's say the person eliminated from the first group has \( y_1 \) points, and the person eliminated from the second group has \( y_2 \) points. After elimination, the total number of points in the first group is \( \frac{25 - x}{2} - y_1 \), and the total number of points in the second group is \( \frac{25 - x}{2} - y_2 \).

5. **Fourth Event:**
   - The remaining 11 people in each group are divided into two groups of 5 and 6.
   - Each group has a total of \( \frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_1}{2} \) points in the group of 5 and \( \frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_2}{2} \) points in the group of 6.

6. **Fifth Event:**
   - One person is eliminated from each group, and the total number of points is reduced by the number of points that person had in their respective group.
   - Let's say the person eliminated from the group of 5 has \( z_1 \) points, and the person eliminated from the group of 6 has \( z_2 \) points. After elimination, the total number of points in the group of 5 is \( \frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_1}{2} - z_1}{2} \), and the total number of points in the group of 6 is \( \frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_2}{2} - z_2}{2} \).

7. **Sixth Event:**
   - The remaining 4 people in each group are divided into two groups of 2.
   - Each group has a total of \( \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_1}{2} - z_1}{2} - w_1}{2} \) points in the first group and \( \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_2}{2} - z_2}{2} - w_2}{2} \) points in the second group.

8. **Seventh Event:**
   - One person is eliminated from each group, and the total number of points is reduced by the number of points that person had in their respective group.
   - Let's say the person eliminated from the first group has \( v_1 \) points, and the person eliminated from the second group has \( v_2 \) points. After elimination, the total number of points in the first group is \( \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_1}{2} - z_1}{2} - w_1}{2} - v_1}{2} \), and the total number of points in the second group is \( \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_2}{2} - z_2}{2} - w_2}{2} - v_2}{2} \).

9. **Eighth Event:**
   - The remaining 1 person in each group is left.
   - Each group has a total of \( \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_1}{2} - z_1}{2} - w_1}{2} - v_1}{2} - u_1}{2} \) points in the first group and \( \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_2}{2} - z_2}{2} - w_2}{2} - v_2}{2} - u_2}{2} \) points in the second group.

10. **Final Event:**
    - The remaining 2 people are left.
    - Each person has a total of \( \frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{\frac{25 - x}{2} - y_1}{2} - z_1}{2} - w_1}{2} - v_1}{2} - u_1}{2} \) points.

Given the constraints of the problem, we need to find the number of people who are still in the game after all these events. The key is to recognize that the total number of points remains constant at 25, and the number of people decreases by one in each step. Therefore, after 25 steps, there will be 1 person left.

Thus, the number of people who are still in the game is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",902,"[902, '902']",False
