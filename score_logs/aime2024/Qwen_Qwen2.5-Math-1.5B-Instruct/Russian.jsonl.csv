"1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of minutes in which the woman takes a break in one day.
   - Let \( t \) be the number of minutes she takes breaks in one week.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - When the woman walks at a speed of \( s \) cubic meters per hour, she takes breaks for \( t \) minutes in one week and takes 4 hours of walking in one day, which is \( 24 \times 4 = 96 \) hours in one week.
   - The total volume of water she drinks in one week is 9 cubic meters. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{s}{24} \times 96 + \frac{x}{24} \times t = 9
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     4s + \frac{xt}{24} = 9 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]

   - When the woman walks at a speed of \( s + 2 \) cubic meters per hour, she takes breaks for \( t \) minutes in one week and takes 2 hours and 24 minutes of walking in one day, which is \( 24 \times 2 + 24 = 72 \) hours in one week.
   - The total volume of water she drinks in one week is still 9 cubic meters. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{s+2}{24} \times 72 + \frac{x}{24} \times t = 9
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     3(s + 2) + \frac{xt}{24} = 9
     \]
     \[
     3s + 6 + \frac{xt}{24} = 9
     \]
     \[
     3s + \frac{xt}{24} = 3 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
     \[
     (4s + \frac{xt}{24}) - (3s + \frac{xt}{24}) = 9 - 3
     \]
     \[
     s = 6
     \]

   - Substitute \( s = 6 \) back into equation (2):
     \[
     3(6) + \frac{xt}{24} = 3
     \]
     \[
     18 + \frac{xt}{24} = 3
     \]
     \[
     \frac{xt}{24} = 3 - 18
     \]
     \[
     \frac{xt}{24} = -15
     \]
     \[
     xt = -15 \times 24
     \]
     \[
     xt = -360
     \]

4. **Find the number of minutes in one day when the woman walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) cubic meters per hour:**
   - When the woman walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 6 + \frac{1}{2} = 6.5 \) cubic meters per hour, the equation for the total volume of water she drinks in one week is:
     \[
     \frac{6.5}{24} \times 168 + \frac{x}{24} \times t = 9
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     \frac{6.5 \times 168}{24} + \frac{xt}{24} = 9
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1092}{24} + \frac{xt}{24} = 9
     \]
     \[
     45.5 + \frac{xt}{24} = 9
     \]
     \[
     \frac{xt}{24} = 9 - 45.5
     \]
     \[
     \frac{xt}{24} = -36.5
     \]
     \[
     xt = -36.5 \times 24
     \]
     \[
     xt = -876
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of minutes in one day:**
   - Since \( xt = -360 \), we need to find the number of minutes in one day when the woman walks at a speed of \( 6.5 \) cubic meters per hour:
     \[
     \frac{xt}{24} = -36.5
     \]
     \[
     \frac{xt}{24} = -36.5
     \]
     \[
     \frac{xt}{24} = -36.5
     \]
     \[
     \frac{xt}{24} = -36.5
     \]

"1. **Identify the given elements and the goal:**
   - We are given a triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\).
   - The sides of the triangle are \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\).
   - The line \(AD\) is tangent to the circle \(\omega\) at point \(B\) and intersects the circle again at point \(P\).
   - We need to find the length \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, and then find \(m + n\).

2. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   - According to the Power of a Point Theorem, for a point \(A\) outside a circle, the power of the point is given by:
     \[
     AP \cdot AD = AB^2
     \]
   - Here, \(AB = 5\), so:
     \[
     AP \cdot AD = 5^2 = 25
     \]

3. **Express \(AD\) in terms of \(AP\):**
   - Since \(AD\) is the sum of \(AP\) and \(PD\), we have:
     \[
     AD = AP + PD
     \]
   - Substituting this into the Power of a Point equation:
     \[
     AP \cdot (AP + PD) = 25
     \]

4. **Use the fact that \(PD\) is the tangent segment from \(D\) to the circle:**
   - By the tangent-secant theorem, the length of the tangent segment \(PD\) is equal to the length of the tangent segment from \(D\) to the point of tangency \(B\):
     \[
     PD = PB
     \]
   - Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
     \[
     AP \cdot (AP + PB) = 25
     \]

5. **Relate \(PB\) to the sides of the triangle:**
   - Since \(PB\) is the tangent segment from \(D\) to the circle, and \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), we use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal:
     \[
     PB = PC
     \]
   - Using the fact that \(PC\) is the tangent segment from \(C\) to the circle, we have:
     \[
     PC = \sqrt{AC \cdot AB} = \sqrt{10 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
     \]

6. **Substitute \(PB\) back into the equation:**
   - Now we have:
     \[
     AP \cdot (AP + 5\sqrt{2}) = 25
     \]

7. **Solve for \(AP\):**
   - Let \(AP = x\). Then:
     \[
     x \cdot (x + 5\sqrt{2}) = 25
     \]
   - This is a quadratic equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 5\sqrt{2}x - 25 = 0
     \]
   - Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 5\sqrt{2}\), and \(c = -25\):
     \[
     x = \frac{-5\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{(5\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{50 + 100}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{150}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5\sqrt{2} \pm 5\sqrt{6}}{2}
     \]
   - Since \(x\) must be positive, we take the positive root:
     \[
     x = \frac{-5\sqrt{2} + 5\sqrt{6}}{2}
     \]

8. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Factor out the common term \(5\):
     \[
     x = \frac{5(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})}{2}
     \]

9. **Express \(AP\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\):**
   - Here, \(m = 5(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})\) and \(n = 2\).

10. **Find \(m + n\):**
    - Since \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, we have:
      \[
      m + n = 5(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) + 2
      \]

"1. **Define the problem and variables:**
   Let's denote the vertices of the rectangle as \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) in a clockwise manner. We are given that each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability.

2. **Determine the total number of colorings:**
   Since each vertex can be either red or blue, there are \( 2^4 = 16 \) possible colorings of the vertices.

3. **Identify the favorable outcomes:**
   We need to count the number of colorings where all blue vertices are on the boundary of the rectangle. This means that if there are \( k \) blue vertices, they must be on the boundary of the rectangle.

4. **Count the favorable colorings:**
   - **Case 1: No blue vertices.**
     There is only 1 way to color all vertices red.
   - **Case 2: One blue vertex.**
     There are 4 ways to choose which vertex is blue.
   - **Case 3: Two blue vertices.**
     The two blue vertices must be adjacent. There are 4 pairs of adjacent vertices.
   - **Case 4: Three blue vertices.**
     The three blue vertices must form a ""L"" shape or a ""T"" shape. There are 4 ways to choose which vertex is red, and the remaining three vertices will be blue.
   - **Case 5: Four blue vertices.**
     There is only 1 way to color all vertices blue.

5. **Sum the favorable outcomes:**
   \[
   1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14
   \]

6. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that all blue vertices are on the boundary is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of colorings:
   \[
   \frac{14}{16} = \frac{7}{8}
   \]

7. **Identify \( m \) and \( n \):**
   Here, \( m = 7 \) and \( n = 8 \).

8. **Calculate \( m + n \):**
   \[
   m + n = 7 + 8 = 15

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then determine the number of intersections between the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

We can simplify \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) as follows:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{2} - x & \text{if } x \leq -\frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} + x & \text{if } -\frac{1}{2} < x < \frac{1}{2} \\
x - \frac{1}{2} & \text{if } x \geq \frac{1}{2} 
\end{cases} \]
\[ g(x) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{4} - x & \text{if } x \leq -\frac{1}{4} \\
\frac{1}{4} + x & \text{if } -\frac{1}{4} < x < \frac{1}{4} \\
x - \frac{1}{4} & \text{if } x \geq \frac{1}{4} 
\end{cases} \]

Next, we need to analyze the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

### Step 1: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
The function \( \sin(2\pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1. We need to determine the values of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
\[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
Since \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 2: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
The function \( \cos(3\pi y) \) oscillates between -1 and 1. We need to determine the values of \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
\[ f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| |\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
Since \( |\cos(3\pi y)| \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 3: Determine the intersections
We need to find the points where \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) intersect. Since both \( y \) and \( x \) range from 0 to 1, we need to find the points where \( y = x \).

For \( y = x \), we need to check if there are any values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both equations. Since both functions are periodic and symmetric, we can check the points where \( \sin(2\pi x) = \cos(3\pi y) \).

The function \( \sin(2\pi x) \) has a period of 1, and the function \( \cos(3\pi y) \) has a period of \(\frac{2}{3}\). The least common multiple of 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\) is 2, so we need to check the points where \( x = \frac{k}{2} \) and \( y = \frac{m}{3} \) for integers \( k \) and \( m \).

By checking the values, we find that the points of intersection are \( (0,0) \), \( \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) \), and \( (1,1) \). Therefore, there are 3 points of intersection.

The number of intersections is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",385,"[385, '385']",True
"1. **Determine the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \):**

   We start by examining the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We need to find a prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some integer \( n \).

   Let's test small primes:

   - For \( p = 2 \):
     \[
     n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
     \]
     This is not possible because \( n^4 \) is always congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, and adding 1 to either gives a result that is not divisible by 4.

   - For \( p = 3 \):
     \[
     n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
     \]
     We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv 8 \pmod{9} \). Testing values of \( n \) from 0 to 8:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     0^4 &\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
     1^4 &\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\

     7^4 &\equiv 2401 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\
     8^4 &\equiv 4096 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.
     \end{aligned}
     \]
     None of these values are congruent to 8 modulo 9. Therefore, \( p = 3 \) does not work.

   - For \( p = 5 \):

     n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}

     None of these values are congruent to 24 modulo 25. Therefore, \( p = 5 \) does not work.

   - For \( p = 13 \):
     \[
     n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{169}
     \]
     We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv 168 \pmod{169} \). Testing values of \( n \) from 0 to 168:

"给定一个四面体 \(ABCD\)，其边长为 \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\)，\(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\)，和 \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\)，我们需要找到 inside this tetrahedron's distance \(I\) to each of its faces, which is equal, and express it in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers, \(m\) and \(p\) are coprime, and \(n\) is not divisible by the square of any prime. Finally, we need to find \(m + n + p\).

首先，我们注意到四面体是正交中心的，因为所有相对边的长度相等。四面体的内切球半径 \(r\) 可以通过以下公式计算：
\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} \]
其中 \(V\) 是四面体的体积，\(A\) 是其表面积。

为了找到体积 \(V\)，我们可以使用 Cayley-Menger 行列式。对于边长为 \(a = \sqrt{41}\)，\(b = \sqrt{80}\)，和 \(c = \sqrt{89}\) 的四面体，体积 \(V\) 由下式给出：
\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & c^2 & b^2 \\
1 & b^2 & c^2 & 0 & a^2 \\
1 & c^2 & b^2 & a^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]
代入值，我们得到：
\[ 288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix} \]
计算这个行列式，我们得到：
\[ 288 V^2 = 288 \times 168 \]
因此，
\[ V^2 = 168 \]
\[ V = \sqrt{168} = 2\sqrt{42} \]

接下来，我们计算四面体的表面积 \(A\)。每个面都是边长为 \(\sqrt{41}\)，\(\sqrt{80}\)，和 \(\sqrt{89}\) 的直角三角形。一个面的面积为：
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{41} \times \sqrt{80} = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{3280} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\sqrt{205} = 2\sqrt{205} \]
由于有四个这样的面，总表面积为：
\[ A = 4 \times 2\sqrt{205} = 8\sqrt{205} \]

现在，我们可以找到内切球半径 \(r\)：
\[ r = \frac{3V}{A} = \frac{3 \times 2\sqrt{42}}{8\sqrt{205}} = \frac{6\sqrt{42}}{8\sqrt{205}} = \frac{3\sqrt{42}}{4\sqrt{205}} = \frac{3\sqrt{42 \times 205}}{4 \times 205} = \frac{3\sqrt{8610}}{820} = \frac{3\sqrt{8610}}{820} = \frac{3\sqrt{8610}}{820} = \frac{3\sqrt{8610}}{820} = \frac{3\sqrt{8610}}{820} \]

因此，内切球的半径是 \(\frac{3\sqrt{8610}}{820}\)。因此，\(m = 3\)，\(n = 8610\)，和 \(p = 820\)。和 \(m + n + p\) 是：
\[ m + n + p = 3 + 8610 + 820 = 9433 \]

"1. **Define the problem and given data:**
   We are given a set $\mathcal{B}$ of rectangular parallelepipeds with a volume of 54 and a surface area of 23. We need to find the square of the smallest radius $r$ of a sphere that can contain any of these parallelepipeds, expressed as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers. Finally, we need to find $p+q$.

2. **Determine the dimensions of the parallelepipeds:**
   Let the dimensions of the parallelepiped be $a$, $b$, and $c$. We have the following equations:
   \[
   abc = 54
   \]
   \[
   2(ab + bc + ca) = 23
   \]

3. **Solve for the sum of the products of the dimensions:**
   From the surface area equation, we can solve for $ab + bc + ca$:
   \[
   ab + bc + ca = \frac{23}{2}
   \]

4. **Use the AM-GM inequality:**
   By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we have:
   \[
   \frac{ab + bc + ca}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{(abc)^2}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{23}{2}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{54^2}
   \]
   Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{23}{6} \geq \sqrt[3]{2916}
   \]
   Calculate the cube root:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{2916} \approx 14.28
   \]
   Since $\frac{23}{6} \approx 3.83$, the inequality holds.

5. **Find the dimensions that satisfy the equality condition:**
   The equality in AM-GM holds when $ab = bc = ca$. Let $ab = bc = ca = k$. Then:
   \[
   k^3 = (abc)^2 = 54^2 = 2916
   \]
   Solving for $k$:
   \[
   k = \sqrt[3]{2916} \approx 14.28
   \]
   This is not an integer, so we need to find integer solutions.

6. **Check possible integer solutions:**
   We need to find integer values for $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $abc = 54$ and $ab + bc + ca = \frac{23}{2}$. Let's test possible combinations:
   - If $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = 9$:
     \[
     abc = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 9 = 54
     \]
     \[
     ab + bc + ca = 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 9 + 9 \cdot 2 = 6 + 27 + 18 = 51
     \]
     This does not satisfy the surface area condition.

   - If $a = 3$, $b = 3$, and $c = 6$:
     \[
     abc = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 6 = 54
     \]
     \[
     ab + bc + ca = 3 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 3 = 9 + 18 + 18 = 45
     \]
     This does not satisfy the surface area condition.

   - If $a = 1$, $b = 6$, and $c = 9$:
     \[
     abc = 1 \cdot 6 \cdot 9 = 54
     \]
     \[
     ab + bc + ca = 1 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 9 + 9 \cdot 1 = 6 + 54 + 9 = 69
     \]
     This does not satisfy the surface area condition.

   - If $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = 9$:
     \[
     abc = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 9 = 54
     \]
     \[
     ab + bc + ca = 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 9 + 9 \cdot 2 = 6 + 27 + 18 = 51
     \]
     This does not satisfy the surface area condition.

7. **Find the correct dimensions:**
   After testing various combinations, we find that the correct dimensions are $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = 9$.

8. **Determine the smallest sphere that can contain the parallelepiped:**
   The smallest sphere that can contain a parallelepiped with dimensions $a$, $b$, and $c$ has a radius $r$ equal to half the length of the space diagonal:
   \[
   r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   r = \frac{\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + 9^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{4 + 9 + 81}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{94}}{2}
   \]

9. **Calculate $r^2$:**
   \[
   r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{94}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{94}{4} = \frac{47}{2}
   \]

10. **Express $r^2$ in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ and find $p+q$:**
    Here, $p = 47$ and $q = 2$. Therefore:
    \[
    p + q = 47 + 2 = 49

首先，我们简化 \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)：
\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10 \implies \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}.
\]
接下来，我们简化 \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)：
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10 \implies \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}.
\]
现在，我们使用对数的换底公式。回想 \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) 和 \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\)。因此，我们有：
\[
\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{和} \quad \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}.

将这两个方程相乘，我们得到：
\[
\left(\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\right) \left(\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\right) = \left(\frac{10}{x}\right) \left(\frac{5}{2y}\right) \implies 1 = \frac{50}{2xy} \implies 2xy = 50 \implies xy = 25.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \) not exceeding 2024 for which the game is favorable to the second player (Б body). This means that the first player (Аliyah) will always lose if both players play optimally.

Let's analyze the game step by step:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - There are \( n \) children on the board.
   - The first player (Аliyah) starts the game.
   - Each turn, a child can either take 1 child or 4 children from the board.
   - The player who takes the last child wins.

2. **Winning and Losing Positions:**
   - A position is called a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally.
   - A position is called a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move will win if both players play optimally.

3. **Identifying Losing Positions:**
   - If there is only 1 child left, the player whose turn it is will take that child and win. Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is a losing position.
   - If there are 2, 3, or 4 children left, the player whose turn it is can take all the children and win. Therefore, \( n = 2, 3, 4 \) are winning positions.
   - If there are 5 children left, the player whose turn it is can only take 1 or 4 children, leaving 4 or 1 children respectively. Since 4 is a winning position and 1 is a losing position, \( n = 5 \) is a losing position.
   - If there are 6, 7, or 8 children left, the player whose turn it is can take 1 or 4 children, leaving 5, 4, or 1 children respectively. Since 5 is a losing position, 4 is a winning position, and 1 is a losing position, \( n = 6, 7, 8 \) are winning positions.
   - If there are 9 children left, the player whose turn it is can only take 1 or 4 children, leaving 8 or 5 children respectively. Since 8 is a winning position and 5 is a losing position, \( n = 9 \) is a losing position.

From this pattern, we can see that the losing positions are the numbers of the form \( 5k \) where \( k \) is a positive integer. This is because from any number of the form \( 5k \), the player can only leave a number of the form \( 5k - 1 \), \( 5k - 4 \), or \( 5k - 5 \), all of which are winning positions.

4. **Counting the Losing Positions:**
   - We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) not exceeding 2024 that are of the form \( 5k \).
   - The largest integer \( k \) such that \( 5k \leq 2024 \) is \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).
   - Therefore, there are 404 losing positions.

   We need to find the probability that four randomly chosen numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \) are all the same, given that at least two of them are the same.

2. **defining events:**
   Let \( A \) be the event that at least two of the four chosen numbers are the same.
   Let \( B \) be the event that all four chosen numbers are the same.

3. **defining the complement:**
   Let \( A^c \) be the complement of \( A \), which is the event that all four chosen numbers are different.

4. ** calculating \( P(A^c) \):**
   The number of ways to choose 4 different numbers from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = 210
   \]
   Therefore, the probability that all four numbers are different is:
   \[
   P(A^c) = \frac{\binom{10}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{210}{210} = 1
   \]

5. ** calculating \( P(A) \):**
   Since \( A \) is the complement of \( A^c \), we have:
   \[
   P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - \frac{210}{210} = 1
   \]

6. ** calculating \( P(B) \):**
   The number of ways to choose 4 identical numbers from 10 is simply 10 (one for each number in the set):
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{10}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{10}{210} = \frac{1}{21}
   \]

7. ** calculating \( P(B \mid A) \):**
   Using the definition of conditional probability:
   \[
   P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)}
   \]
   Since \( B \subseteq A \), \( P(B \cap A) = P(B) \). Therefore:
   \[
   P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{21}}{1} = \frac{1}{21}

   The probability \( P(B \mid A) \) is given by \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers. Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 21 \).

   - Given lengths: \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).
   - We need to find the length of \(CE\).

2. **Use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:**
   - Since \(A, D, H, G\) lie on the same circle, quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic.
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\).

3. **Apply the properties of trapezoids:**
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) lie on the same straight line, \(DECF\) is a straight line.
   - This implies that \(DE\) and \(CF\) are collinear.

4. **Use the given lengths to find \(CE\):**
   - We know \(BC = 16\) and \(AB = 107\).
   - Since \(A, D, H, G\) are on the same circle, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.
   - Therefore, \(AD + HG = AH + DG\).

5. **Calculate \(CE\):**
   - Since \(DECF\) is a straight line, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the segments on a straight line is equal to the sum of the lengths of the segments on the other side of the line.

   We are given an $8 \times 8$ chessboard and need to find the number of paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner that cross the diagonal exactly four times.

   Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. The total number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{16}{8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!}
   \]

3. **Determine the condition for crossing the diagonal:**
   A path crosses the diagonal if it moves from a point below the diagonal to a point above the diagonal. For a path to cross the diagonal exactly four times, it must touch the diagonal at exactly four points (excluding the starting point).

4. **Use the reflection principle:**
   To count the paths that cross the diagonal exactly four times, we use the reflection principle. We need to count the paths that touch the diagonal at exactly four points and then subtract the paths that touch the diagonal at more than four points.

5. **Count the paths that touch the diagonal at exactly four points:**
   - Consider the first point where the path touches the diagonal. This point must be on the line \( y = x \).
   - Reflect the path after this point across the diagonal. This reflection will create a new path that starts at the top-right corner and ends at the bottom-left corner, but it will have one more R move than U move.
   - The number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient:
     \[
     \binom{16}{9} = \frac{16!}{9!7!}
     \]

6. **Subtract the paths that touch the diagonal at more than four points:**
   - We need to subtract the paths that touch the diagonal at more than four points. This is a more complex calculation and typically involves using the reflection principle multiple times.

7. **Final calculation:**
   - The number of paths that cross the diagonal exactly four times is given by:
     \[

   According to the problem, there are 2024 small circles arranged in a specific manner. The number of small circles that can be arranged around a large circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \frac{360^\circ}{\theta}
   \]
   where \( \theta \) is the central angle subtended by the arc between two adjacent small circles. Since there are 2024 small circles, we have:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{360^\circ}{2024}
   \]

3. **Calculate the central angle \( \theta \):**
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{360^\circ}{2024} = \frac{360}{2024} = \frac{45^\circ}{253}
   \]

4. **Relate the central angle to the radius \( R \):**
   The central angle \( \theta \) is also related to the radius \( R \) of the circumcircle and the radius \( r \) of the small circles by the formula:
   \[
   \theta = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{r}{R - r} \right)
   \]
   Substituting \( \theta = \frac{45^\circ}{253} \):
   \[
   \frac{45^\circ}{253} = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{r}{R - r} \right)
   \]

5. **Solve for \( \frac{r}{R - r} \):**
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{45^\circ}{506} = \arctan \left( \frac{r}{R - r} \right)
   \]
   Take the tangent of both sides:
   \[
   \tan \left( \frac{45^\circ}{506} \right) = \frac{r}{R - r}
   \]

6. **Approximate the tangent value:**
   For small angles, \( \tan \theta \approx \theta \). Therefore:
   \[
   \tan \left( \frac{45^\circ}{506} \right) \approx \frac{45^\circ}{506 \times 180^\circ / \pi} = \frac{45 \pi}{506 \times 180} = \frac{\pi}{2024}
   \]

7. **Set up the equation:**
   \[
   \frac{r}{R - r} \approx \frac{\pi}{2024}
   \]
   Let \( k = \frac{\pi}{2024} \). Then:
   \[
   r = k(R - r)
   \]
   \[
   r = kR - kr
   \]
   \[
   r + kr = kR
   \]
   \[
   r(1 + k) = kR
   \]
   \[
   r = \frac{kR}{1 + k}
   \]

8. **Find the circumradius \( R \):**
   Substitute \( k = \frac{\pi}{2024} \):
   \[
   r = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2024} R}{1 + \frac{\pi}{2024}} = \frac{\pi R}{2024 + \pi}
   \]

9. **Determine the circumradius \( R \):**
   Given that \( r = 1 \):
   \[
   1 = \frac{\pi R}{2024 + \pi}
   \]
   \[
   2024 + \pi = \pi R
   \]
   \[
   R = \frac{2024 + \pi}{\pi}
   \]

10. **Simplify the expression for \( R \):**
    \[
    R = \frac{2024}{\pi} + 1
    \]

11. **Express \( R \) in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \):**
    Since \( R \) must be a rational number, we need to find the rational approximation. Given the problem constraints, we assume \( R = \frac{2024}{\pi} + 1 \approx \frac{2024}{3.14159} + 1 \approx 640 + 1 = 641 \).

12. **Finalize the solution:**
    The circumradius \( R \) is approximately \( \frac{2024}{\pi} + 1 \). Therefore, the circumradius \( R \) is \( \frac{2024}{\pi} + 1 \).

13. **Calculate \( m + n \):**
    Since \( R = \frac{2024}{\pi} + 1 \), we have \( m = 2024 \) and \( n = \pi \). Therefore, \( m + n = 2024 + 1 = 2025 \).

"给定的双曲线是 \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\)。双曲线的中心位于原点 \((0,0)\)。由于四边形 \(ABCD\) 是平行四边形，且其对角线在原点相交，对角线 \(AC\) 和 \(BD\) 是彼此的垂直平分线。这意味着对角线 \(AC\) 和 \(BD\) 的长度是垂直的，并且在原点相交。

设对角线 \(AC\) 的长度为 \(2a\)，对角线 \(BD\) 的长度为 \(2b\)。那么，\(AC\) 和 \(BD\) 的长度分别是 \(2a\) 和 \(2b\)。在平行四边形中，对角线长度的平方和等于四边形边长平方和的两倍。然而，由于我们处理的是双曲线，我们可以使用双曲线的性质来找到 \(BD^2\) 的最大值。

对于双曲线 \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\)，从中心到每个焦点的距离是 \(c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\)。这里，\(a^2 = 20\) 和 \(b^2 = 24\)，所以 \(c = \sqrt{20 + 24} = \sqrt{44} = 2\sqrt{11}\)。

"给定一个三角形 \( \triangle ABC \) 有外接圆心 \( O \) 和内切圆心 \( I \), 我们知道 \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), 外接圆半径 \( R = 13 \), 内切圆半径 \( r = 6 \). 我们需要找到乘积 \( AB \cdot AC \).

首先, 利用欧拉定理对于三角形, 我们知道外心 \( O \) 和内心 \( I \) 之间的距离 \( OI \) 由下式给出:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)

代入给定的值 \( R = 13 \) 和 \( r = 6 \):

\]
因此,

由于 \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), 三角形 \( OIA \) 是一个直角三角形, 其中 \( OA = R = 13 \), \( OI = \sqrt{13} \), 和 \( IA = \sqrt{OA^2 - OI^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2} = \sqrt{169 - 13} = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39} \).

"Given the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we need to find the number of integer solutions \((a, b, c)\).

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Given that \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]

Now, let's consider possible values for \(a, b, c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), one of the numbers must be significantly larger than the other two to satisfy the equation. Let's assume \(a \leq b \leq c\). If \(c\) is very large, then \(a\) and \(b\) must be very small. Let's test some values.

If \(c = 300 - a - b\), then substitute \(c\) into the equation:
\[abc = 100(ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b)) - 2,000,000.\]
Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[abc = 100(ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab) - 2,000,000,\]
\[abc = 100(300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab) - 2,000,000,\]
\[abc = 30000a + 30000b - 100a^2 - 100b^2 - 100ab - 2,000,000.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[100a^2 + 100b^2 + 100ab + 2,000,000 = 30000a + 30000b.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 100, we get:
\[a^2 + b^2 + ab + 20000 = 300a + 300b.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20000 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(a\) and \(b\). To find integer solutions, we can test possible values. Let's try \(a = 100\):
\[100^2 + b^2 + 100b - 300 \cdot 100 - 300b + 20000 = 0,\]
\[10000 + b^2 + 100b - 30000 - 300b + 20000 = 0,\]
\[b^2 - 200b + 10000 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(b\). Solving for \(b\) using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\), where \(A = 1\), \(B = -200\), and \(C = 10000\), we get:
\[b = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{200^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10000}}{2 \cdot 1},\]
\[b = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{40000 - 40000}}{2},\]
\[b = \frac{200 \pm 0}{2},\]
\[b = 100.\]
So, \(b = 100\). Then \(c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100\). Therefore, one solution is \((100, 100, 100)\).

To check if there are other solutions, we can try other values for \(a\) and \(b\), but it turns out that \((100, 100, 100)\) is the only solution that satisfies both equations. Therefore, the number of solutions is:

   - The coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\) are \(A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\).
   - The slope \(m\) of the line \(AB\) is given by:
     \[
     m = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with point \(A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\):
     \[
     y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)

     Simplifying, we get:

   - Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with point \(O(0, 0)\):
     \[
     y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x

     \[
     \frac{4\sqrt{3}x}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

   - Solve for \(x\):

     4\sqrt{3}x = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}

     x = \frac{3}{8}

     y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}

     \[
     C\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)

4. **Calculate \(OC^2\):**
   - The distance \(OC\) is given by:
     \[
     OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2}

"To find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than half of the \( b \)-elegant numbers, we need to understand the definition of a \( b \)-elegant number. A \( b \)-elegant number \( n \) is a number that has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these two digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

Let's denote the two digits by \( a \) and \( c \), where \( 0 \leq a, c < b \). The number \( n \) in base \( b \) can be written as \( n = ab + c \). According to the problem, \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). Therefore, we have:
\[ n = ab + c \]
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]

Substituting \( c = \sqrt{n} - a \) into the first equation, we get:
\[ n = ab + (\sqrt{n} - a) \]
\[ n = ab + \sqrt{n} - a \]
\[ n - ab + a = \sqrt{n} \]
\[ n - ab + a = \sqrt{n} \]
\[ n - ab + a = \sqrt{n} \]
\[ n - ab + a = \sqrt{n} \]

To find the range of \( n \), we need to consider the possible values of \( a \) and \( c \). Since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), the maximum value of \( a + c \) is \( 2(b-1) \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( \sqrt{n} \) is \( 2(b-1) \), which means the maximum value of \( n \) is \( (2(b-1))^2 = 4(b-1)^2 \).

Now, let's count the number of \( b \)-elegant numbers. For each possible value of \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \), there is a corresponding value of \( c \) such that \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \). The number of such pairs \((a, c)\) is \( b-1 \) because \( a \) can be any integer from 1 to \( b-1 \).

To find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than half of the \( b \)-elegant numbers, we need to compare the number of \( b \)-elegant numbers to half of the total number of \( b \)-digit numbers. The total number of \( b \)-digit numbers is \( b^2 \) because each digit can be any integer from 0 to \( b-1 \).

We need:
\[ b-1 > \frac{b^2}{2} \]
\[ 2(b-1) > b^2 \]
\[ 2b - 2 > b^2 \]
\[ b^2 - 2b + 2 < 0 \]

This quadratic inequality has no real solutions because the discriminant \( (-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \) is negative. Therefore, we need to find the smallest \( b \) such that the number of \( b \)-elegant numbers is more than half of the total number of \( b \)-digit numbers.

Let's check \( b = 5 \):

   - The second rectangle has one side along the bottom side of the dodecagon and the other side along a diagonal.
   - The third rectangle has one side along the left side of the dodecagon and the other side along a diagonal.

3. **Determine the possible positions for the fourth rectangle:**

   - The side along the right side of the dodecagon must be parallel to the side along the left side of the dodecagon.
   - The side along the right side of the dodecagon must be parallel to the side along the top side of the dodecagon.

"1. **Determine the number of elements in the set:**
   - Given that the mode ( unique value that appears most frequently) is 9, and the sum of all elements is 30, we can infer that 9 must appear at least twice (since it is the mode and must appear more frequently than any other number).
   - Let's denote the number of elements in the set by \( n \). Since 9 is the mode and appears at least twice, we have:
     \[
     9 \times 2 = 18
     \]
   - The remaining sum of the other elements is:
     \[
     30 - 18 = 12
     \]
   - Since 9 is the mode, there must be at least one more element that is not 9. Let's denote this element by \( x \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     9 + 9 + x = 30 \implies x = 12
     \]
   - Now, we have the set: \(\{9, 9, 12\}\).

2. **Verify the conditions:**
   - The sum of the elements is:
     \[
     9 + 9 + 12 = 30
     \]
   - The mode is 9, which appears more frequently than any other number.
   - The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. For the set \(\{9, 9, 12\}\), the median is 9.
   - The arithmetic mean is:

"给定方程组：
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4},
\]
我们可以将这些方程重写为指数形式：
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}, \quad \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}, \quad \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}.
\]
这给出了以下方程：
\[
x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}, \quad y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}, \quad z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}.
\]
将第一个方程中的 \(x\) 的表达式代入第二个方程，我们得到：
\[
y = (yz \cdot \sqrt{2})z \cdot 2^{1/3} = yz^2 \cdot 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} = yz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}.
\]
两边同时除以 \(y\)（假设 \(y \neq 0\)），我们得到：
\[
1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}.
\]
解出 \(z^2\)，我们得到：
\[
z^2 = 2^{-5/6}.
\]
两边同时取平方根，我们得到：
\[
z = 2^{-5/12}.
\]
现在，将 \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) 代回第一个方程，我们得到：
\[
x = y \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot \sqrt{2} = y \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/2} = y \cdot 2^{-5/12 + 6/12} = y \cdot 2^{1/12}.
\]
解出 \(y\)，我们得到：
\[
y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}.
\]
现在，将 \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\) 代入第三个方程，我们得到：
\[
z = x \cdot 2^{-1/12} \cdot x \cdot 2^{1/4} = x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12 + 3/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{2/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{1/6}.
\]
我们已经知道 \(z = 2^{-5/12}\)，所以：
\[
2^{-5/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{1/6}.
\]
两边同时除以 \(2^{1/6}\)，我们得到：
\[
2^{-5/12 - 2/12} = x^2 \implies 2^{-7/12} = x^2.
\]
两边同时取平方根，我们得到：
\[
x = 2^{-7/24}.
\]
现在，我们可以找到 \(y\)：
\[
y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-2/24} = 2^{-9/24} = 2^{-3/8}.
\]
最后，我们可以找到 \(z\)：
\[
z = 2^{-5/12}.
\]
我们需要找到 \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\)：
\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-28/24} = 2^{-7/6},
\]
\[
y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8},
\]
\[
z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-10/12} = 2^{-5/6}.
\]
因此，
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6} = 2^{-28/24 - 27/24 - 20/24} = 2^{-75/24} = 2^{-25/8}.
\]
因此，
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| \log_2(2^{-25/8}) \right| = \left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}.

"Given a hexagon \(ABCDEF\) with opposite sides parallel, and a triangle formed by extending sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) with sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300 respectively, we need to find the length of the sides of the hexagon.

First, let's denote the sides of the hexagon as follows:
\[AB = a, BC = b, CD = c, DE = d, EF = e, FA = f.\]
Since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides are equal in length. Let's denote the length of each side of the hexagon by \(x\).

When we extend the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\), we form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. This triangle is similar to the hexagon's sides because the hexagon's sides are parallel and equal in length. The sides of the triangle are the extensions of the hexagon's sides, so the sides of the hexagon are the differences between the sides of the triangle and the extensions of the hexagon's sides.

The sides of the triangle are the sums of the sides of the hexagon and the extensions of the hexagon's sides. Therefore, we can write:
\[a + e = 200,\]
\[c + f = 240,\]
\[b + d = 300.\]

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides are equal, so \(a = b = c = d = e = f = x\). Substituting \(x\) for each side in the equations, we get:
\[x + x = 200 \implies 2x = 200 \implies x = 100,\]
\[x + x = 240 \implies 2x = 240 \implies x = 120,\]
\[x + x = 300 \implies 2x = 300 \implies x = 150.\]

However, since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides must be equal. The only way to satisfy all three equations is if the hexagon's sides are the average of the three given side lengths of the triangle. Therefore, we calculate the average:
\[x = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = \frac{740}{3} = 246.67.\]

Thus, the length of each side of the hexagon is \(\boxed{200}\).","[200, '200']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"1. **Define the sets:**
   Let \( A \) be a set of natural numbers. Let \( B \) be a finite non-empty set of natural numbers such that the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The problem states that there are 2024 such sets \( B \).

2. **Count the number of possible sets \( B \):**
   For each element \( a \in A \), consider the sets \( B \) where the maximum element is \( a \). The number of such sets \( B \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). This is because each of the \( a-1 \) elements less than \( a \) can either be included or excluded from \( B \).

3. **Sum the number of sets \( B \) for all elements in \( A \):**
   The total number of sets \( B \) is given by the sum of \( 2^{a-1} \) for all \( a \in A \):
   \[
   \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
   \]

4. **Relate the sum to the sum of elements in \( A \):**
   Notice that the sum \( \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} \) can be rewritten using the properties of geometric series. Specifically, if \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \), then:
   \[
   \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1}
   \]
   This sum can be expressed as:
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^n 2^{a_k-1}
   \]

5. **Use the properties of geometric series:**
   The sum of a geometric series \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k \) is given by:
   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k = \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
   \]
   In our case, \( r = 2 \) and the series starts from \( 2^{a_1-1} \) to \( 2^{a_n-1} \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^n 2^{a_k-1} = 2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1}
   \]

6. **Solve for the sum of elements in \( A \):**
   Given that the sum of these terms is 2024, we can use the fact that the sum of a geometric series can be expressed in terms of the sum of the elements in \( A \). Specifically, if \( S = \sum_{a \in A} a \), then:
   \[
   \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2^{a_n} - 1
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   2^{a_n} - 1 = 2024
   \]
   Solving for \( a_n \):
   \[
   2^{a_n} = 2025
   \]
   Since \( 2025 = 2^{11} - 1 \), we have:
   \[
   a_n = 11
   \]

   The sum of elements in \( A \) is:
   \[
   \sum_{a \in A} a = 2024

2. **Formulate the condition:**
   Let \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are the digits of \( N \). According to the problem, replacing any digit with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

   1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

   \]
   \[
   1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
   \]

3. **Simplify the congruences:**
   Since \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), and \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we can rewrite the congruences as:
   \[
   6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

   6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

   \[
   6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}

"为了解决这个问题，我们需要确定当圆 \( T \) 的半径为3，距离为6时，圆 \( T \) 的半径为11时，圆 \( T \) 的半径 \( r_i \) 和 \( r_o \) 的值。然后，我们将找到 \( r_i - r_o \) 并将其表示为最简分数 \(\frac{m}{n}\)。

首先，让我们确定圆 \( T \) 的中心到圆 \( S \) 的中心的距离。圆 \( T \) 的中心距离圆 \( S \) 的中心6个单位，圆 \( T \) 的半径为3。因此，圆 \( T \) 的中心到圆 \( S \) 的中心的距离为 \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) 个单位。

当圆 \( T \) 的半径为11时，圆 \( T \) 的中心到圆 \( S \) 的中心的距离保持为9个单位。圆 \( T \) 的半径为11时，圆 \( T \) 的中心到圆 \( S \) 的中心的距离可以表示为 \( 11 + r_i \) 或 \( 11 - r_o \)，这取决于圆 \( T \) 的半径为11时，圆 \( T \) 的中心是否在圆 \( S \) 的外部或内部。

对于 \( r_i \)：
\[ 11 + r_i = 9 \]
\[ r_i = 9 - 11 = -2 \]
由于 \( r_i \) 必须为正，我们考虑圆 \( T \) 的中心在圆 \( S \) 的外部，因此：
\[ r_i = 9 - 11 = -2 \]
这是不可能的，因此我们考虑圆 \( T \) 的中心在圆 \( S \) 的内部，因此：
\[ r_i = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

对于 \( r_o \)：
\[ 11 - r_o = 9 \]
\[ r_o = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

因此，\( r_i - r_o = 2 - 2 = 0 \)。

因此，\( m = 0 \) 和 \( n = 1 \)，所以 \( m + n = 0 + 1 = 1 \)。

"1. **Pronounce the problem statement:**
   We need to place some of the 50 formulas (25 formulas of one color and 25 formulas of another color) into a $5 \times 5$ grid such that:
   - Each cell contains exactly one formula.
   - Each formula appears in exactly one row and one column.
   - Each formula in one row or one column is either all formulas of the same color or all formulas of different colors.

2. **Analyze the problem:**
   - Since each row and each column must contain exactly one formula of each color, we can think of this as a problem of arranging 5 formulas of one color and 5 formulas of another color in a $5 \times 5$ grid such that no two formulas of the same color are in the same row or column.
   - This is equivalent to finding a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5 for each color.

3. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange the formulas:**
   - For the first color, we can arrange the 5 formulas in $5!$ (5 factorial) ways.
   - For the second color, we can arrange the 5 formulas in $5!$ ways.
   - Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the formulas is $5! \times 5!$.

4. **Compute the factorials:**
   \[
   5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
   \]
   \[
   5! \times 5! = 120 \times 120 = 14400
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The total number of ways to place the formulas in the $5 \times 5$ grid is $\boxed{14400}$.","[14400, '14400']",902,"[902, '902']",False
