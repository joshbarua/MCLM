"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) where \( s \) and \( t \) are the number of oranges and pears respectively, and they satisfy the conditions given in the problem.

First, let's summarize the conditions:
1. When the number of oranges is \( s \) and the number of pears is \( t \), the total number of fruits is 24.
2. When the number of oranges is \( s + 2 \) and the number of pears is \( t - 2 \), the total number of fruits is 24.
3. When the number of oranges is \( s + 2 \) and the number of pears is \( t - 2 \), the total number of fruits is 24.

From the first condition, we have:
\[ s + t = 24 \]

From the second condition, we have:
\[ (s + 2) + (t - 2) = 24 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ s + t = 24 \]
This is the same as the first condition, so it doesn't provide new information.

From the third condition, we have:
\[ (s + 2) + (t - 2) = 24 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ s + t = 24 \]
This is the same as the first condition, so it doesn't provide new information.

Since the conditions are the same, we need to look at the problem again. The problem states that the total number of fruits is 24 in all three scenarios, which means the conditions are consistent and we need to find the value of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \).

From the first condition, we have:
\[ s + t = 24 \]
We need to find \( s \). Since the conditions are consistent, we can assume that the number of oranges and pears are such that the total is 24. Let's assume \( s = 12 \) and \( t = 12 \) (since the conditions are symmetric and the total is 24).

Then, we have:
\[ s + \frac{1}{2} = 12 + \frac{1}{2} = 12.5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) is:
\[ \boxed{12.5} \]","[12.5000000000000, '12.5']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"Given the triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we need to find the length of \(AP\) where \(P\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the line \(BC\). We are also given that \(AP = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, and we need to find \(m + n\).

First, we use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle \(ABC\). The semi-perimeter \(s\) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]
The area \(K\) of the triangle is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
The area of the triangle can also be expressed as:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AP = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times AP = \frac{9}{2} \times AP
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
6\sqrt{14} = \frac{9}{2} \times AP \implies AP = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]
Thus, \(m = 4\sqrt{14}\) and \(n = 3\), but since \(m\) and \(n\) are integers, we need to rationalize the expression. Here, \(m = 4\sqrt{14}\) and \(n = 3\) are already in their simplest form with \(m\) and \(n\) being coprime. Therefore, \(m = 4\sqrt{14}\) and \(n = 3\) are the correct integers.

The value of \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 4\sqrt{14} + 3
\]
However, since \(m\) and \(n\) are integers, we need to rationalize the expression. Here, \(m = 4\sqrt{14}\) and \(n = 3\) are already in their simplest form with \(m\) and \(n\) being coprime. Therefore, \(m = 4\sqrt{14}\) and \(n = 3\) are the correct integers.

The value of \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 4\sqrt{14} + 3

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( m + n \) where \( \frac{m}{n} \) is the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of two dice is 7. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes when two dice are rolled:**
   Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of possible outcomes when two dice are rolled is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the numbers on the top faces is 7:**
   The pairs of numbers that add up to 7 are:
   \[
   (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)
   \]
   There are 6 such pairs.

3. **Calculate the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces is 7:**
   The probability \( P \) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
   \[
   P = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]
   So, \( \frac{m}{n} = \frac{1}{6} \). Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 6 \).

4. **Calculate \( m + n \):**

"To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then use them to find the values of \( y \) and \( x \) that satisfy the given equations. Let's start by understanding the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

The function \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) can be broken down as follows:
- If \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( |x| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).

The function \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \) can be broken down as follows:
- If \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( |x| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).

Now, let's analyze the given equations:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

First, let's find \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the cases where \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \) and \( |\sin(2\pi x)| > \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \leq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2\pi x)| \).
- If \( |\sin(2\pi x)| > \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = |\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \).

Next, let's find \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, let's analyze the equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \):
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \), so \( y = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \right) = 1 - 4 f(\sin(2\pi x)) \).
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \), so \( y = 4 \left( f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 f(\sin(2\pi x)) - 1 \).

Similarly, for the equation \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):
- If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \leq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \), so \( x = 4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \right) = 1 - 4 f(\cos(3\pi y)) \).
- If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) > \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \), so \( x = 4 \left( f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \right) = 4 f(\cos(3\pi y)) - 1 \).

By analyzing the equations, we can see that the only solution that satisfies both equations is when \( x = y = 0 \). This is because if \( x = 0 \), then \( \sin(2\pi x) = 0 \), so \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} \), so \( y = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 \). Similarly, if \( y = 0 \), then \( \cos(3\pi y) = 1 \), so \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} \), so \( x = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 \).

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is a prime number such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some integer \( n \).

First, let's analyze the condition \( p^2 \mid n^4 + 1 \). This means that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2} \), or equivalently, \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

We need to find a prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). Let's test small prime numbers.

For \( p = 2 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \]
This is not possible because \( n^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{4} \), and neither \( 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) nor \( 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \) is congruent to 0 modulo 4.

For \( p = 3 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \]
This is not possible because \( n^4 \equiv 0, 1, 7 \pmod{9} \), and none of these plus 1 is congruent to 0 modulo 9.

For \( p = 5 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \]
This is not possible because \( n^4 \equiv 0, 1, 16 \pmod{25} \), and none of these plus 1 is congruent to 0 modulo 25.

For \( p = 13 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{169} \]
This is possible because \( n = 84 \) works:
\[ 84^4 + 1 = 49787136 + 1 = 49787137 \]
\[ 49787137 \div 169 = 293401 \]
So, \( 169 \mid 84^4 + 1 \).

Now, we need to find \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 13^2 = 169 \). We already know that \( 84^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{169} \), so \( m = 84 \) is a solution.

To verify, we need to check if \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 13^2 = 169 \) for other values of \( m \). Since \( 84 \) is a solution, we can use the fact that \( m \equiv 84 \pmod{169} \) will also be a solution. Therefore, the smallest positive \( m \) is \( 84 \).

Thus, the value of \( m \) is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",110,"[110, '110']",False
"Given the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the coordinates of the incenter \(I\) and the value of \(m+n+p\) where the distance from \(I\) to the sides of the quadrilateral is \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\).

First, we place the quadrilateral in the coordinate plane. Let \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (a, 0)\), \(C = (b, c)\), and \(D = (d, e)\). Since \(AB = \sqrt{41}\), we have \(a = \sqrt{41}\). Also, since \(BC = \sqrt{89}\), we have \((b-a)^2 + c^2 = 89\). Similarly, since \(AC = \sqrt{80}\), we have \(b^2 + c^2 = 80\). Solving these equations, we get \(b = 8\) and \(c = 3\). Therefore, \(C = (8, 3)\).

Next, we use the fact that \(AD = \sqrt{89}\) and \(BD = \sqrt{80}\). This gives us the equations \((d-0)^2 + e^2 = 89\) and \((d-8)^2 + (e-3)^2 = 80\). Solving these, we get \(d = 0\) and \(e = 9\). Therefore, \(D = (0, 9)\).

Now, we find the coordinates of the incenter \(I\). The incenter of a quadrilateral is the intersection of the angle bisectors. However, for a kite, the incenter lies on the line of symmetry, which is the perpendicular bisector of the diagonals. The diagonals of the kite are \(AC\) and \(BD\), and they intersect at the origin \((4, 3)\). The incenter lies on the line \(x = 4\).

To find the y-coordinate of the incenter, we use the fact that the incenter is equidistant from all sides. The distance from the incenter to \(AB\) is the y-coordinate of the incenter, and the distance from the incenter to \(AD\) is the x-coordinate of the incenter. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the incenter is \(\frac{3 \sqrt{41}}{8}\).

Thus, the distance from the incenter to the sides of the quadrilateral is \(\frac{3 \sqrt{41}}{8}\). Here, \(m = 3\), \(n = 41\), and \(p = 8\). Therefore, \(m+n+p = 3+41+8 = 52\).

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( r^2 \) and then determine \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( r^2 = \frac{p}{q} \). Finally, we need to find \( p + q \).

First, let's identify the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 54x + 23 = 0 \). The roots of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) are given by the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
For the equation \( x^2 - 54x + 23 = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -54 \), and \( c = 23 \). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ x = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{54^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 23}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{2916 - 92}}{2} = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{2824}}{2} = \frac{54 \pm 2\sqrt{706}}{2} = 27 \pm \sqrt{706} \]
So, the roots are \( 27 + \sqrt{706} \) and \( 27 - \sqrt{706} \).

The product of the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 54x + 23 = 0 \) is given by \( c/a = 23 \). Therefore, the product of the roots is 23. This means that the product of the roots \( r \) is 23. Since \( r \) is the product of the roots, we have:
\[ r = 23 \]
Thus, \( r^2 = 23 \). Here, \( p = 23 \) and \( q = 1 \), so \( p + q = 23 + 1 = 24 \).

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the value of \(xy\).

First, let's simplify the given equations using the properties of logarithms.

1. Simplify \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\):
\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

2. Simplify \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\):
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Next, we use the change of base formula for logarithms. Recall that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}
\]
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Now, substitute \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\) into \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\):
\[
\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]
Since \(\log(y) = \frac{10}{x} \log(x)\), substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{\log(x)}{\frac{10}{x} \log(x)} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{10} = \frac{5}{2y}

Next, we need to count the number of ways to choose 4 elements such that exactly 2 of them are from the set \( \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \). We can do this in two steps:
1. Choose 2 elements from the set \( \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \).
2. Choose 2 elements from the set \( \{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\} \).

The number of ways to choose 2 elements from the set \( \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \) is:

The number of permutations of 8 elements is given by the factorial of 8, denoted as 8!. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number. Therefore, we calculate:

"Given that \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the value of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\).

First, let's denote \(z\) as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) since \(|z| = 4\). Then, the complex conjugate of \(z\) is \(\overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta}\).

The expression we need to evaluate is:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}

Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying the second term:
\[
\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

We can separate this into real and imaginary parts. First, let's expand the terms:
\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} = 300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta}
\]
\[
(24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} = 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}
\]

Adding these together, we get:
\[
300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta} + 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}

We can group the real and imaginary parts:

Using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we can rewrite the expression:
\[
300(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 24(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) + 468i(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 36i(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Simplifying the real and imaginary parts separately:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta) + (300i\sin\theta - 24i\sin\theta) + (468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]
\[
= (324\cos\theta) + (324i\sin\theta) + (504i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta)
\]

Combining the real and imaginary parts:
\[
324\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)
\]

Notice that the expression is purely real because the imaginary parts cancel out:
\[
324\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
\]

Since the imaginary parts cancel out, the expression simplifies to a real number. To find the value, we can use the fact that the expression is symmetric and the magnitudes of the terms are such that the imaginary parts cancel out, leaving us with:
\[
324\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta = 0
\]

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( m+n \) where \( \frac{m}{n} \) is the ratio of the sum of the altitudes of triangle \( ABC \) to the sum of its sides, and \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers.

First, let's denote the sides of the triangle \( ABC \) as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), and the corresponding altitudes as \( h_a \), \( h_b \), and \( h_c \). The area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of its sides and altitudes as:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} a h_a = \frac{1}{2} b h_b = \frac{1}{2} c h_c. \]
Let the area of the triangle be \( \Delta \). Then we have:
\[ h_a = \frac{2\Delta}{a}, \quad h_b = \frac{2\Delta}{b}, \quad h_c = \frac{2\Delta}{c}. \]
The sum of the altitudes is:
\[ h_a + h_b + h_c = \frac{2\Delta}{a} + \frac{2\Delta}{b} + \frac{2\Delta}{c} = 2\Delta \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \right). \]
The sum of the sides is:
\[ a + b + c. \]
The ratio of the sum of the altitudes to the sum of the sides is:
\[ \frac{h_a + h_b + h_c}{a + b + c} = \frac{2\Delta \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \right)}{a + b + c} = \frac{2\Delta \left( \frac{ab + bc + ca}{abc} \right)}{a + b + c} = \frac{2\Delta (ab + bc + ca)}{(a + b + c)abc}. \]
Using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides and the circumradius \( R \), we have:
\[ \Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}. \]
Substituting this into the ratio, we get:
\[ \frac{2 \cdot \frac{abc}{4R} (ab + bc + ca)}{(a + b + c)abc} = \frac{ab + bc + ca}{2R(a + b + c)}. \]
For a triangle with sides 13, 14, and 15, we can calculate the area using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) is:
\[ s = \frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21. \]
The area \( \Delta \) is:
\[ \Delta = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{21(21-13)(21-14)(21-15)} = \sqrt{21 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6} = \sqrt{7056} = 84. \]
The circumradius \( R \) is given by:
\[ R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta} = \frac{13 \cdot 14 \cdot 15}{4 \cdot 84} = \frac{2730}{336} = \frac{65}{8}. \]
The sum of the altitudes is:
\[ h_a + h_b + h_c = \frac{2 \cdot 84 \left( \frac{13 \cdot 14 + 14 \cdot 15 + 15 \cdot 13}{13 \cdot 14 \cdot 15} \right)}{13 + 14 + 15} = \frac{168 \left( \frac{182 + 210 + 195}{2730} \right)}{42} = \frac{168 \left( \frac{587}{2730} \right)}{42} = \frac{168 \cdot 587}{42 \cdot 2730} = \frac{587}{65}. \]
The sum of the sides is:
\[ 13 + 14 + 15 = 42. \]
The ratio of the sum of the altitudes to the sum of the sides is:
\[ \frac{587}{65 \cdot 42} = \frac{587}{2730}. \]
Since 587 and 2730 are coprime, the ratio is in its simplest form. Therefore, \( m = 587 \) and \( n = 2730 \), and \( m+n = 587 + 2730 = 3317 \).

"Given the hyperbola equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the value of \(BD^2\) where \(ABCD\) is a rectangle inscribed in the hyperbola with \(A, B, C, D\) being the vertices of the rectangle.

First, let's identify the vertices of the hyperbola. The standard form of a hyperbola is \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\), where \(a^2 = 20\) and \(b^2 = 24\). Therefore, \(a = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\) and \(b = \sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{6}\).

The vertices of the hyperbola are at \((\pm a, 0) = (\pm 2\sqrt{5}, 0)\) and \((0, \pm b) = (0, \pm 2\sqrt{6})\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle inscribed in the hyperbola, the vertices of the rectangle will be at \((\pm x, \pm y)\) where \(x\) and \(y\) satisfy the hyperbola equation. The length of the diagonal \(BD\) of the rectangle is the distance between \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\), which is given by:
\[BD = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2} = 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\).

Since \((x, y)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). To find \(x^2 + y^2\), we can use the fact that the points \((x, y)\) and \((x, -y)\) are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, and the points \((-x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\) are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the points \((x, y)\) and \((-x, y)\) are on the hyperbola, and the points \((x, y)\) and \((x, -y)\) are on the hyperbola.

We can express \(y^2\) in terms of \(x^2\) using the hyperbola equation:
\[\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{y^2}{24} = \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \implies y^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{24x^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24.\]
Thus,
\[x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + \left( \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = x^2 + \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24 = \frac{5x^2 + 6x^2}{5} - 24 = \frac{11x^2}{5} - 24.\]
Since \(x^2 = 20\) (from the vertices of the hyperbola), we substitute \(x^2 = 20\) into the equation:
\[x^2 + y^2 = \frac{11 \cdot 20}{5} - 24 = \frac{220}{5} - 24 = 44 - 24 = 20.\]
Therefore,
\[BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) = 4 \cdot 20 = 80.\]

\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 \]

We need to find the value of \(abc\).

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc \]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc \]

We know from the problem statement that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 \]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[ 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000 \]

Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[ 100(ab + bc + ca) = 2,000,000 + abc \]
\[ ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + \frac{abc}{100} \]

Now, let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then:
\[ a + a + a = 300 \]
\[ 3a = 300 \]
\[ a = 100 \]

So, if \(a = b = c = 100\), then:
\[ ab + bc + ca = 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 = 30,000 \]
\[ 30,000 = 20,000 + \frac{abc}{100} \]
\[ 10,000 = \frac{abc}{100} \]
\[ abc = 1,000,000 \]

"Given points \(O = (0,0)\), \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\), we need to find the locus \(\mathcal{F}\) of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) where \(P\) is on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) is on the \(y\)-axis, and \(\overline{PQ}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\).

First, we find the equation of line \(\overline{AB}\). The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope of } \overline{AB} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
The equation of line \(\overline{AB}\) in point-slope form is:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}(x - \frac{1}{2}) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
The slope of the line perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\) is the negative reciprocal of \(-\sqrt{3}\), which is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\). Therefore, the equation of line \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x + c
\]
Since \(\overline{PQ}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{AB}\), the product of their slopes is \(-1\). The line \(\overline{PQ}\) intersects the \(x\)-axis at \(P = \left(-\frac{3c}{\sqrt{3}}, 0\right) = \left(-c\sqrt{3}, 0\right)\) and the \(y\)-axis at \(Q = \left(0, c\right)\). The midpoint of \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[
\left(\frac{-c\sqrt{3} + 0}{2}, \frac{0 + c}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{c\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{c}{2}\right)
\]
This midpoint lies on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting \(\left(-\frac{c\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{c}{2}\right)\) into the line equation, we get:
\[
\frac{c}{2} = -\sqrt{3}\left(-\frac{c\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies \frac{c}{2} = \frac{3c}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies -c = \sqrt{3} \implies c = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]
Thus, the equation of line \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}(x - 1)
\]
The locus \(\mathcal{F}\) is the line \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}(x - 1)\). To find the locus of the midpoint of \(\overline{PQ}\), we note that the midpoint is \(\left(\frac{-c\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{c}{2}\right)\). Substituting \(c = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\), we get:
\[
\left(\frac{-\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}\right)
\]
The locus \(\mathcal{F}\) is the line \(y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}(x - 1)\). The distance from the origin to this line is:
\[
\frac{\left|0 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}(0 - 1)\right|}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}{\sqrt{\frac{3}{9} + 1}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}{\sqrt{\frac{12}{9}}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}{\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}} = \frac{1}{2}

Thus, the distance from the origin to the line is \(\frac{1}{2}\), so \(p = 1\) and \(q = 2\), and \(p + q = 3\). Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. This means \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

We can factor this expression using the fact that \(\omega\) is a root of unity. Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). However, we can use the polynomial identity for roots of unity. Specifically, we can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) factors as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2)\cdots(x-\omega^{12}).\]

We are interested in the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) evaluated at \(x = 2 - 2x + x^2\). To find the product, we need to evaluate \(P(2 - 2x + x^2)\) at the roots of unity \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

Let's substitute \(x = \omega^k\) into the polynomial:
\[P(2 - 2\omega^k + (\omega^k)^2) = (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})^{13} - 1.\]

Since \(\omega^{13} = 1\), we have \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). However, we can simplify our task by noting that the product of the values of a polynomial evaluated at the roots of unity is related to the constant term of the polynomial. Specifically, the product of the values of a polynomial \(P(x)\) evaluated at the roots of unity is given by \((-1)^n P(0)\) if the polynomial is monic and of degree \(n\).

In our case, the polynomial is \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\), which is monic and of degree 13. The constant term of this polynomial is \(-1\). Therefore, the product of the values of \(P(x)\) evaluated at the roots of unity is:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (-1)^{13} = -1.\]

However, we need to consider the factor of 2 in the original expression. Each term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) is a root of the polynomial \(P(x)\) shifted by 2. The product of the roots of a polynomial \(P(x)\) is given by \((-1)^n \frac{a_0}{a_n}\), where \(a_0\) is the constant term and \(a_n\) is the leading coefficient. In our case, the leading coefficient is 1, so the product of the roots is simply the constant term, which is \(-1\).

Therefore, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is:

This implies that the number \(81\) in base \(13\) is represented as \(\overline{63}_{13}\).

First, let's convert \(\overline{63}_{13}\) back to base \(10\):
\[
\overline{63}_{13} = 6 \cdot 13^1 + 3 \cdot 13^0 = 6 \cdot 13 + 3 \cdot 1 = 78 + 3 = 81

This confirms that \(\overline{63}_{13} = 81_{10}\).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the pattern and the constraints given. The problem involves creating a 3x3 grid of digits such that the sum of the digits in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Additionally, the sum of the digits in the entire grid is 999, and the sum of the digits in each of the 3x3 sub-grids is 99.

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

2. The sum of the digits in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same.
3. The sum of the digits in each 3x3 sub-grid is 99.

Since the sum of the digits in each 3x3 sub-grid is 99, and there are 9 such sub-grids in the 9x9 grid, the total sum of all digits in the grid is \(9 \times 99 = 891\). However, the problem states that the total sum is 999, which means there is an additional sum of \(999 - 891 = 108\) distributed among the digits. This additional sum must be distributed in a way that maintains the balance of the sums in the rows, columns, and diagonals.

Given the constraints, the only way to achieve this is to have the digits in the grid such that the sum of the digits in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is 111. This is because \(999 / 9 = 111\).

"Given the equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We start by converting these logarithmic equations into exponential form:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply these three equations together:
\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right)}
\]

We need to find the sum of the exponents:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Equating the simplified left-hand side and right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:
\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

We need to find \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\):
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2((xyz)^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2})
\]

Using the properties of logarithms:
\[
\log_2((xyz)^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}) = \log_2((xyz)^4) + \log_2(y^{-1}) + \log_2(z^{-2})
\]

Substituting \(xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\):
\[
\log_2((2^{-\frac{13}{12}})^4) + \log_2(y^{-1}) + \log_2(z^{-2}) = \log_2(2^{-\frac{52}{12}}) + \log_2(y^{-1}) + \log_2(z^{-2})
\]

Simplifying the exponents:
\[
\log_2(2^{-\frac{52}{12}}) = -\frac{52}{12} = -\frac{13}{3}
\]

Since \(y^{-1} = \frac{1}{y}\) and \(z^{-2} = \frac{1}{z^2}\), we have:
\[
\log_2(y^{-1}) = -\log_2(y)
\]
\[
\log_2(z^{-2}) = -2\log_2(z)
\]

Thus:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{13}{3} - \log_2(y) - 2\log_2(z)
\]

We need to find the absolute value:
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| -\frac{13}{3} - \log_2(y) - 2\log_2(z) \right|
\]

Since \(y\) and \(z\) are positive, we can simplify further:
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| -\frac{13}{3} \right| = \frac{13}{3}
\]

Thus, the value of \(m\) is 13 and the value of \(n\) is 3. Therefore, \(m + n = 13 + 3 = 16\).

We are also given that the sum of the digits of the numbers \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) is 200, 240, and 300 respectively, and we need to find the sum of the digits of the number formed by concatenating \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\).

Let's denote the three-digit numbers as \(AB = 100A + B\), \(CD = 100C + D\), and \(EF = 100E + F\). The sum of the digits of these numbers are given by:
\[ A + B = 200, \]

"Given the problem, we need to determine the value of \( A \) based on the information provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - \( A \) is a number.
   - \( B \) is another number.
   - The relationship between \( A \) and \( B \) is given in terms of their digits and their positions.
   - The sum of the digits of \( A \) and \( B \) is 2024.
   - The number \( A \) is a multiple of 9.

2. **Sum of Digits:**
   - The sum of the digits of \( A \) and \( B \) is 2024.
   - Since \( A \) is a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must also be a multiple of 9.

3. **Finding \( A \):**
   - Let's denote the sum of the digits of \( A \) as \( S_A \) and the sum of the digits of \( B \) as \( S_B \).
   - We have \( S_A + S_B = 2024 \).
   - Since \( S_A \) is a multiple of 9, let \( S_A = 9k \) for some integer \( k \).

4. **Possible Values for \( S_A \):**
   - \( S_A \) must be a multiple of 9 and must be less than or equal to 2024.
   - The largest multiple of 9 less than or equal to 2024 is \( 2025 \) (since \( 2025 = 9 \times 225 \)).
   - Therefore, \( S_A \) can be any multiple of 9 from 9 to 2025.

5. **Finding \( S_B \):**
   - \( S_B = 2024 - S_A \).
   - \( S_B \) must also be a multiple of 9 (since the sum of the digits of \( B \) must be a multiple of 9).

6. **Determining \( A \):**
   - We need to find \( A \) such that the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9 and the sum of the digits of \( B \) is also a multiple of 9.
   - Since \( A \) is a multiple of 9, we can use the property that a number is a multiple of 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The problem does not provide enough information to determine a unique value for \( A \) without additional constraints or specific values for \( B \).
   - However, based on the given information, we can conclude that \( A \) must be a multiple of 9.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the value of \( A \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( Q \) and \( R \) such that \( N \equiv Q \pmod{10} \) and \( N \equiv R \pmod{7} \), where \( Q \) and \( R \) are the remainders when \( N \) is divided by 10 and 7, respectively. We are also given that \( N \) is a three-digit number and that \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{10} \) and \( N \equiv 7 \pmod{7} \).

First, let's express \( N \) in terms of its remainders:
\[ N \equiv 1 \pmod{10} \]
This means that the last digit of \( N \) is 1. So, we can write:
\[ N = 10k + 1 \]
for some integer \( k \).

Next, we know that:
\[ N \equiv 7 \pmod{7} \]
Since \( 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), this simplifies to:
\[ N \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
This means that \( N \) is a multiple of 7. So, we can write:
\[ N = 7m \]
for some integer \( m \).

Now we have two expressions for \( N \):
\[ N = 10k + 1 \]
\[ N = 7m \]
Equating the two expressions, we get:
\[ 10k + 1 = 7m \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 10k - 7m = -1 \]
