"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of pasta Aja would eat if she ate \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers of pasta, given the information about her eating habits.

First, let's establish the relationship between the amount of pasta Aja eats and the time she spends eating it. We know that Aja eats 9 kilometers of pasta in \( t \) minutes. Therefore, her eating rate is:
\[
\text{Eating rate} = \frac{9 \text{ kilometers}}{t \text{ minutes}}
\]

Next, we are given two scenarios:
1. Aja eats \( s \) kilometers of pasta in \( t \) minutes, and then 2 kilometers in 24 minutes.
2. Aja eats \( s + 2 \) kilometers of pasta in \( t \) minutes, and then 2 kilometers in 24 minutes.

From the first scenario, we can write the equation for the total time spent eating:
\[
t + 24 = \frac{s \text{ kilometers}}{\text{Eating rate}} = \frac{s \text{ kilometers}}{\frac{9 \text{ kilometers}}{t \text{ minutes}}} = \frac{s t}{9}
\]
Solving for \( s \):
\[
t + 24 = \frac{st}{9} \implies 9(t + 24) = st \implies 9t + 216 = st \implies s = \frac{9t + 216}{t} = 9 + \frac{216}{t}
\]

From the second scenario, we can write the equation for the total time spent eating:
\[
t + 24 = \frac{(s + 2) \text{ kilometers}}{\text{Eating rate}} = \frac{(s + 2) \text{ kilometers}}{\frac{9 \text{ kilometers}}{t \text{ minutes}}} = \frac{(s + 2)t}{9}
\]
Solving for \( s \):
\[
t + 24 = \frac{(s + 2)t}{9} \implies 9(t + 24) = (s + 2)t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + 216 = st + 2t \implies 9t + ","[9, '9']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we start by finding the coordinates of the points and the equation of the circumcircle \(\omega\).

First, we use the circumradius formula for a triangle:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K}
\]
where \(a = 9\), \(b = 10\), \(c = 5\), and \(K\) is the area of the triangle. We can find the area \(K\) using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{9 + 10 + 5}{2} = 12
\]
The area \(K\) is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-9)(12-10)(12-5)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 7} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
Now, we can find the circumradius \(R\):
\[
R = \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 5}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of \(BC\) and \(AC\), and \(P\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the circumcircle. The power of point \(A\) with respect to the circumcircle is given by:
\[
AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC
\]
We need to find \(AD\). Since \(D\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\), \(AD\) is the diameter of the circumcircle. Therefore, \(AD = 2R\):
\[
AD = 2 \cdot \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56} = \frac{150\sqrt{14}}{56} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{28}
\]
Now, we can find \(AP\):
\[
AP \cdot \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{28} = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
\]
\[
AP = 50 \cdot \frac{28}{75\sqrt{14}} = \frac{1400}{75\sqrt{14}} = \frac{280}{15\sqrt{14}} = \frac{280\sqrt{14}}{210} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]
Thus, \(AP = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}\), and the values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 4 and 3, respectively. Therefore, \(m + n = 4 + 3 = 7\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) such that the sum of the digits of the numerator and the denominator is minimized, and the fraction represents the simplest form of the fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\).

First, let's understand the problem statement. We need to find a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) such that the sum of the digits of \(m\) and \(n\) is minimized, and the fraction is in its simplest form. Additionally, the fraction should represent the simplest form of the fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\).

Let's start by considering the simplest fractions. The fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\) is a simple fraction, and the sum of the digits of the numerator and the denominator is \(1 + 2 = 3\). This is the smallest possible sum for a fraction in its simplest form.

To verify, let's check if there is any other fraction with a smaller sum of digits. The fraction \(\frac{1}{3}\) has a sum of digits \(1 + 3 = 4\), which is larger than 3. Similarly, the fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\) has a sum of digits \(2 + 3 = 5\), which is also larger than 3. The fraction \(\frac{1}{4}\) has a sum of digits \(1 + 4 = 5\), which is larger than 3. The fraction \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\) is the same as \(\frac{1}{2}\), and the sum of the digits is still 3.

Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\) is the simplest fraction with the smallest sum of digits. The sum of the digits of the numerator and the denominator is \(1 + 2 = 3\).

Thus, the value of \(m + n\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",371,"[371, '371']",True
"To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then use them to find the points of intersection of the curves defined by the equations \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|| \]
\[ g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}|| \]

We need to evaluate \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) and \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \). Let's start with \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
\[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = ||\sin(2\pi x)| - \frac{1}{2}|| \]
Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( |\sin(2\pi x)| \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\). Therefore, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) will range from \( \left|0 - \frac{1}{2}\right| = \frac{1}{2} \) to \( \left|1 - \frac{1}{2}\right| = \frac{1}{2} \), which means \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} \) for all \( x \).

Next, let's evaluate \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
\[ g(\cos(3\pi y)) = ||\cos(3\pi y)| - \frac{1}{4}|| \]
Since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\), \( |\cos(3\pi y)| \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\). Therefore, \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \) will range from \( \left|0 - \frac{1}{4}\right| = \frac{1}{4} \) to \( \left|1 - \frac{1}{4}\right| = \frac{3}{4} \), which means \( g(\cos(3\pi y)) \) can take any value in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Now, we substitute these into the original equations:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = 4 g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \]
Since \( g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left| \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{1}{4} \), we have:
\[ y = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 \]

And for the second equation:
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi \cdot 1))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi))) \]
Since \( \cos(3\pi) = -1 \), we have:
\[ f(-1) = ||-1| - \frac{1}{2}|| = \left|1 - \frac{1}{2}\right| = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \]
So:
\[ x = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \( p \) and \( m \) such that \( p^2 = n^4 + 1 \) and \( p^2 = m^4 + 1 \) for some integers \( n \) and \( m \).

First, let's consider the equation \( p^2 = n^4 + 1 \). We need to find integer solutions for \( n \) and \( p \).

1. **Check small values of \( n \):**
   - For \( n = 0 \):
     \[
     p^2 = 0^4 + 1 = 1 \implies p = \pm 1
     \]
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     \[
     p^2 = 1^4 + 1 = 2 \implies p = \pm \sqrt{2} \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     \[
     p^2 = 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \implies p = \pm \sqrt{17} \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     \[
     p^2 = 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82 \implies p = \pm \sqrt{82} \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     \[
     p^2 = 4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257 \implies p = \pm \sqrt{257} \quad (\text{not an integer})

From the above checks, the only integer solution for \( p \) is when \( n = 0 \) and \( p = \pm 1 \).

2. **Verify the second condition:**
   - For \( m \):
     \[
     p^2 = m^4 + 1
     \]
   - Since \( p = \pm 1 \), we have:
     \[
     1 = m^4 + 1 \implies m^4 = 0 \implies m = 0
     \]

Thus, the values of \( p \) and \( m \) that satisfy both conditions are \( p = 1 \) and \( m = 0 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to the plane containing the opposite face. The given edge lengths are \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \).

First, we need to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \). We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant for the volume of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a, b, c, d, e, f \):

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0

Substituting the given edge lengths \( a = \sqrt{41} \), \( b = \sqrt{80} \), \( c = \sqrt{89} \), \( d = \sqrt{80} \), \( e = \sqrt{41} \), and \( f = \sqrt{89} \):

1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 41 & 89 & 0

\]

Calculating the determinant:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 41 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 41 & 89 & 0

Expanding along the first row:

\[

41 & 0 & 80 & 41 \\
80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
89 & 41 & 89 & 0

\]

This determinant is quite complex to compute directly, so we use a known result for the volume of a tetrahedron with these specific edge lengths. The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron with these edge lengths is:

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 \cdot 80}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{41 \cdot 80^2 \cdot 89}
\]

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 80 \sqrt{41 \cdot 89}
\]

\[
V = \frac{40}{3} \sqrt{3649}
\]

Next, we find the area \( A \) of the base triangle \( \triangle BCD \). Using Heron's formula, we first find the semi-perimeter \( s \):

\[
s = \frac{BC + CD + BD}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{80}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{89} + 2\sqrt{80}}{2}
\]

\[
A = \sqrt{s(s - BC)(s - CD)(s - BD)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
A = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{89} + 2\sqrt{80}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{89} + 2\sqrt{80}}{2} - \sqrt{89}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{89} + 2\sqrt{80}}{2} - \sqrt{80}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{89} + 2\sqrt{80}}{2} - \sqrt{80}\right)}

Simplifying further, we find the height \( h \) from the incenter \( I \) to the plane containing \( \triangle BCD \):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( r \) and then find \( r^2 \) in the form of \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. Finally, we need to find the sum \( p + q \).

First, let's understand the problem statement. The problem states that Lai \(\mathcal{B}\) ir taisveid kastu k ats \(54\) un tilpate \(23\). This means that the total number of kastas is \(54\) and the total number of tilpas is \(23\). The problem also states that the number of kastas and tilpas is related to the number of elements in \(\mathcal{B}\) and the radius \(r\) of the sphere.

The number of kastas and tilpas can be interpreted as the number of elements in a set, which is related to the radius \(r\) of the sphere. The relationship is given by the formula for the surface area and volume of a sphere. The surface area \(A\) of a sphere is given by \(4\pi r^2\) and the volume \(V\) is given by \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\).

From the problem, we know that the number of kastas is \(54\) and the number of tilpas is \(23\). These numbers are related to the surface area and volume of the sphere. The surface area of the sphere is \(4\pi r^2\) and the volume is \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\). The problem states that the number of kastas is \(54\) and the number of tilpas is \(23\), which means that the surface area is \(54\) and the volume is \(23\).

We can set up the following equations:
\[ 4\pi r^2 = 54 \]
\[ \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = 23 \]

First, solve for \(r^2\) from the first equation:
\[ 4\pi r^2 = 54 \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{54}{4\pi} = \frac{27}{2\pi} \]

Next, solve for \(r^3\) from the second equation:
\[ \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = 23 \]
\[ r^3 = \frac{23 \cdot 3}{4\pi} = \frac{69}{4\pi} \]

Now, we need to find \(r\) by taking the cube root of \(r^3\):
\[ r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{69}{4\pi}} \]

However, we need to find \(r^2\) in the form of \(\frac{p}{q}\). From the first equation, we have:
\[ r^2 = \frac{27}{2\pi} \]

Since \(\pi\) is not a rational number, we need to express \(r^2\) in a form that is a rational number. The problem states that \(r^2\) can be expressed as \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers. From the first equation, we can see that:

"To solve for \(x\) and \(y\) given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we start by simplifying each equation using the properties of logarithms.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the power rule of logarithms, \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we can rewrite this as:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10.
\]
Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we can substitute this in:
\[
x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \implies x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \implies \log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}.
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Again, using the power rule of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10.
\]
Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can substitute this in:
\[
4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10 \implies 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \implies \log(y) = \frac{4y \log(x)}{10} = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}.
\]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log(y)\):
\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log(y) = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}.
\]
Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:
\[
\frac{10 \log(x)}{x} = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}.
\]
Assuming \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can cancel \(\log(x)\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5} \implies 50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25.
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sp slice pieces \( n \) that Alise made, given the conditions of the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alise made \( n \) sp slice pieces.
   - Vi requested \( n \) sp slice pieces.
   - Alise made 1 sp slice piece more than Vi requested.
   - Vi requested 4 sp slice pieces more than Alise made.
   - We need to find the number of sp slice pieces \( n \) such that the total number of sp slice pieces Vi requested is 2024.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of sp slice pieces Alise made.
   - Vi requested \( n \) sp slice pieces.
   - Alise made 1 sp slice piece more than Vi requested, so Alise made \( n + 1 \) sp slice pieces.
   - Vi requested 4 sp slice pieces more than Alise made, so Vi requested \( n + 4 \) sp slice pieces.

3. **Formulating the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, Vi requested 2024 sp slice pieces.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     n + 4 = 2024
     \]

4. **Solving for \( n \):**
   - Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     n = 2024 - 4
     \]
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     n = 2020

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of sp slice pieces Alise made is \( n = 2020 \).

Thus, the number of sp slice pieces Alise made is \(\boxed{2020}\).","[2020, '2020']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Vi Maris, whose 4 chosen numbers are not the largest 4 numbers in the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \), has exactly 2 of her chosen numbers being among the largest 4 numbers. We will then find the probability that Vi Maris has exactly 2 of her chosen numbers among the largest 4 numbers and exactly 2 of the remaining 6 numbers among the largest 4 numbers, and finally, we will find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this probability in its simplest form.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to count the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that exactly 2 of them are among the largest 4 numbers. There are \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways to choose 2 numbers from the largest 4 numbers, and \(\binom{6}{2}\) ways to choose 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers:
\[
\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

So, the probability that Vi Maris has exactly 2 of her chosen numbers among the largest 4 numbers is:
\[
\frac{90}{210} = \frac{3}{7}
\]

Now, we need to find the probability that Vi Maris has exactly 2 of her chosen numbers among the largest 4 numbers and exactly 2 of the remaining 6 numbers among the largest 4 numbers. This is the same as the previous calculation because if she has exactly 2 of her chosen numbers among the largest 4 numbers, the remaining 2 must be among the other 6 numbers, and vice versa. Therefore, the probability remains \(\frac{3}{7}\).

The fraction \(\frac{3}{7}\) is already in its simplest form, so \(m = 3\) and \(n = 7\). Therefore, \(m + n = 3 + 7 = 10\).

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the given information about the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral.

First, let's summarize the given information:
- \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral.
- \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
- \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic.
- \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

We need to find the length of \(CE\).

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) and \(C\) are points on the line segment \(DF\). Also, since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, \(A, D, H, G\) form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Given that \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, we can use the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to \(180^\circ\). However, we don't need to use this property directly to find \(CE\).

Instead, we can use the fact that \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral and apply Ptolemy's theorem, which states that for a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\), the product of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides. However, we don't have the lengths of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\), so we need to use another approach.

Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, we can use the fact that the power of a point theorem can be applied. However, we don't need to use this property directly either.

Instead, we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are points on the line segment \(DF\) and that \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral. We can use the fact that the length of \(CE\) can be found using the given lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral.

Since \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, we can use the fact that the length of \(CE\) can be found using the given lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral. We can use the fact that the length of \(CE\) is the same as the length of \(EF\) minus the length of \(FG\).

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:
\[ CE = EF - FG = 184 - 17 = 167 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many reises are required to travel from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, given that we can only move right or down.

1. **Understanding the Grid**: An \(8 \times 8\) grid has 8 rows and 8 columns. To move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, we need to move 7 steps right and 7 steps down. This is because we start at the first column and need to move to the eighth column, which is 7 steps to the right, and we start at the first row and need to move to the eighth row, which is 7 steps down.

2. **Total Steps**: The total number of steps required is the sum of the steps to the right and the steps down. Therefore, we need \(7 + 7 = 14\) steps in total.

3. **Possible Paths**: The number of different paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner is the number of ways to arrange 7 right steps and 7 down steps in a sequence of 14 steps. This is a combinatorial problem and can be solved using the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{14}{7} = \frac{14!}{7!7!}

   However, the problem only asks for the number of reises required, not the number of different paths. Since each path consists of exactly 14 steps, the number of reises required is 14.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum value of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\).

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) where \(\theta\) is a real number. Then, the expression becomes:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]
\[
= 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Now, let's express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of cosine and sine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

The magnitude of this complex number is:
\[
\sqrt{(324\cos\theta - 444\sin\theta)^2 + (312\cos\theta + 399\sin\theta)^2}
\]
To find the minimum value, we can use the fact that the minimum value of \(|a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta|\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) when \(a\) and \(b\) are constants. Here, we have:
\[
324\cos\theta - 444\sin\theta = \sqrt{324^2 + 444^2} \cos(\theta + \phi) \quad \text{and} \quad 312\cos\theta + 399\sin\theta = \sqrt{312^2 + 399^2} \cos(\theta + \psi)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \(ABC\) given the conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a triangle \(ABC\) with an inscribed circle.
   - The radius of the inscribed circle is \(r\).
   - The triangle has sides \(AB = c\), \(BC = a\), and \(CA = b\).
   - The area of the triangle is given by \(K\).
   - The semiperimeter of the triangle is \(s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}\).
   - The radius of the inscribed circle is given by the formula \(r = \frac{K}{s}\).

2. **Using the Given Information:**
   - We know that the radius of the inscribed circle is \(r = \frac{1}{2024}\).
   - The area of the triangle is given by \(K = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - The semiperimeter \(s\) is given by \(s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}\).

3. **Relating the Radius to the Sides:**
   - The area \(K\) can also be expressed in terms of the sides and the radius of the inscribed circle as \(K = r \times s\).
   - Substituting \(r = \frac{1}{2024}\) into the formula, we get \(K = \frac{1}{2024} \times s\).

4. **Finding the Ratio \(\frac{m}{n}\):**
   - We need to find the ratio of the radius of the inscribed circle to the area of the triangle in its simplest form.
   - The radius \(r\) is given as \(\frac{1}{2024}\).
   - The area \(K\) is given as \(\frac{1}{2024} \times s\).
   - Therefore, the ratio \(\frac{r}{K}\) is \(\frac{\frac{1}{2024}}{\frac{1}{2024} \times s} = \frac{1}{s}\).

5. **Simplifying the Ratio:**
   - The ratio \(\frac{r}{K}\) simplifies to \(\frac{1}{s}\).
   - Since \(s\) is the semiperimeter, it is a positive integer.
   - The simplest form of the ratio \(\frac{r}{K}\) is \(\frac{1}{s}\), where \(s\) is an integer.

6. **Finding \(m\) and \(n\):**
   - The ratio \(\frac{r}{K}\) is \(\frac{1}{s}\), where \(m = 1\) and \(n = s\).
   - Since \(s\) is an integer, the simplest form of the ratio is \(\frac{1}{s}\).

7. **Summing \(m\) and \(n\):**
   - The sum \(m + n\) is \(1 + s\).

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of \(s\), we assume that \(s\) is the smallest possible integer that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the sum \(m + n\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the hyperbola and the conditions given. The hyperbola is given by the equation:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1

This is a standard form of a hyperbola with the transverse axis along the \(x\)-axis. The vertices of the hyperbola are at \((\pm \sqrt{20}, 0)\) and the foci are at \((\pm \sqrt{20 + 24}, 0) = (\pm \sqrt{44}, 0)\).

The diagonals of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) are perpendicular and bisect each other, which means \(ABCD\) is a rhombus. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and they intersect at the center of the rhombus, which is also the center of the hyperbola, i.e., the origin \((0,0)\).

The lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus are equal to the distances between the vertices of the hyperbola along the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis. The length of the diagonal along the \(x\)-axis is \(2\sqrt{20} = 4\sqrt{5}\), and the length of the diagonal along the \(y\)-axis is \(2\sqrt{24} = 4\sqrt{6}\).

The area of the rhombus can be calculated using the formula for the area of a rhombus in terms of its diagonals:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\sqrt{5} \times 4\sqrt{6} = 8\sqrt{30}

The area of the rhombus can also be calculated using the formula for the area of a rhombus in terms of its side length and the sine of the angle between the sides. However, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the area is simply half the product of the diagonals.

The problem asks for the value of \(BD^2\), where \(BD\) is one of the diagonals of the rhombus. Since the diagonals of the rhombus are \(4\sqrt{5}\) and \(4\sqrt{6}\), we have:

BD^2 = (4\sqrt{6})^2 = 16 \times 6 = 96

The number of iedzizs skaijot from the second group is 437, and the number of iedzizs skaijot from the third group is 234.

First, recall that the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( OI \) as one leg and \( OA \) as the hypotenuse. The length of \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( IA \):
\[
IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2

\[
IA^2 + 13 = 13^2
\]
\[
IA^2 + 13 = 169
\]
\[
IA^2 = 156
\]
\[

The length \( IA \) is the distance from the incenter to a vertex of the triangle, which is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula:
\[
IA = \sqrt{\frac{bc(s-a)}{s}}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and \( a, b, c \) are the sides of the triangle. However, we can use another approach to find \( AB \cdot AC \) directly. The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed in two ways:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin BAC
\]
and
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
\frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s

Since \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( a, b, c \). However, we can also use the fact that \(IA \) is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula:
\[
IA = \sqrt{\frac{bc(s-a)}{s}}

Given that \(IA = 2\sqrt{39} \), we can use the relationship between the sides and the inradius to find \( AB \cdot AC \). The product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the formula for the area and the inradius:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{4R \cdot r \cdot s}{a} = \frac{4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 \cdot s}{a} = \frac{312 \cdot s}{a}

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We know from the problem statement that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]
So, we have:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]
Now, let's assume that \(a = b = c\). If \(a = b = c\), then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the second equation, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers. We will then find the sum \(p+q\).

First, let's determine the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\) are \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write the equation of the line passing through point \(A\) as:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Since point \(C\) lies on this line, its coordinates can be written as \(C = (x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). The distance \(OC\) from the origin \(O\) to point \(C\) is given by:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2}
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the square root:
\[
OC = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{3}{4}}
\]
\[
OC = \sqrt{4x^2 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x + \frac{3}{4}}
\]
To minimize \(OC\), we need to find the value of \(x\) that minimizes the expression inside the square root. The minimum value of \(OC\) occurs when the derivative of the expression inside the square root with respect to \(x\) is zero. However, we can use the fact that the minimum distance from the origin to a line segment is the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line, which is given by the formula for the distance from a point to a line:
\[
\text{distance} = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
For the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we can rewrite it in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):
\[
\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
\]
The distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to this line is:
\[
\text{distance} = \frac{\left|\sqrt{3} \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|}{\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Thus, \(OC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), and \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 4\), and the sum \(p + q = 3 + 4 = 7\).

\boxed{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. This means \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

We can factor this expression by considering the polynomial whose roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), and the roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We can use the fact that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) to simplify the expression.

Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) implies \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

Now, let's consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial can be found using the resultant of the polynomials.

The polynomial \(2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at \(x = \omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) is:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]

The product of these values is the resultant of the polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). The resultant of two polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) is a number that is zero if and only if the two polynomials have a common root.

The polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) has roots \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) has roots that are the solutions to the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0\). The roots of this quadratic equation are:
\[x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2i}{2} = 1 \pm i.\]

Since \(1 \pm i\) are not roots of \(x^{13} - 1\), the polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) have no common roots. Therefore, the resultant of \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) is non-zero.

The resultant of \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) is the product of the values of \(Q(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\). Since \(P(x)\) has 13 roots and \(Q(x)\) is a quadratic polynomial, the resultant is:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12} Q(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

The value of the resultant of \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) is the constant term of the polynomial \(P(x)\) raised to the power of the degree of \(Q(x)\), which is 13. The constant term of \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) is \(-1\), and the degree of \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) is 2. Therefore, the resultant is:
\((-1)^2 = 1.\]

However, we need to consider the sign of the product. Since the polynomial \(Q(x)\) has a positive leading coefficient, the product of the values of \(Q(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\) is positive. Therefore, the value of the product is:
\[\boxed{1000}.\]","[1000, '1000']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a number \( n \) such that when it is divided by \( b \), the quotient is a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of the digits of this two-digit number equals \( \sqrt{n} \). Additionally, \( n \) should be such that there are at least 10 different values of \( b \) for which this condition holds.

Let's start by expressing \( n \) in terms of \( b \). If \( n \) divided by \( b \) gives a two-digit number \( ab \) in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab \cdot b = ab^2 \]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits in base \( b \), so \( 1 \leq a < b \) and \( 0 \leq b < b \). The sum of the digits of the two-digit number \( ab \) is \( a + b \), and we are given that this sum equals \( \sqrt{n} \). Therefore, we have:
\[ a + b = \sqrt{n} \]
Substituting \( n = ab^2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ a + b = \sqrt{ab^2} = b\sqrt{a} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ (a + b)^2 = ab^2 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of diagonals in a 12-sided polygon (dodecagon). A dodecagon is a polygon with 12 sides and 12 vertices.

The formula to find the number of diagonals in an \( n \)-sided polygon is given by:

where \( n \) is the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon.

For a dodecagon, \( n = 12 \). Plugging this value into the formula, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to find a four-digit number where the sum of its digits is 30, the number is unique modulo 9, and the number is the smallest possible number that meets these criteria.

First, let's recall that a number is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9. Therefore, the number we are looking for must be congruent to 30 modulo 9. Since \(30 \equiv 3 \pmod{9}\), the number we are looking for must be congruent to 3 modulo 9.

We need to find the smallest four-digit number that satisfies these conditions. Let's denote the four-digit number as \(ABCD\), where \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) are its digits. The number can be expressed as \(1000A + 100B + 10C + D\), and we know that \(A + B + C + D = 30\).

We need to find the smallest \(ABCD\) such that \(A + B + C + D = 30\) and \(ABCD \equiv 3 \pmod{9}\). Let's start by trying the smallest possible value for \(A\), which is 1 (since \(A\) cannot be 0 for a four-digit number).

If \(A = 1\), then \(B + C + D = 29\). We need to find the smallest \(B, C,\) and \(D\) such that \(B + C + D = 29\) and \(1 + B + C + D \equiv 3 \pmod{9}\). This simplifies to \(1 + 29 \equiv 3 \pmod{9}\), which is true because \(30 \equiv 3 \pmod{9}\).

Now, we need to find the smallest values for \(B, C,\) and \(D\) that sum to 29. The smallest values are 9, 9, and 11, but since \(D\) must be a digit (0-9), we need to adjust. The next smallest values are 9, 9, and 11-9=2, but again, 11 is not a digit. We need to adjust again to the next smallest values, which are 9, 9, and 11-9=2, but again, 11 is not a digit.

"To solve the problem, we need to find two three-digit numbers such that the sum of the digits in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately, when the digits in the units place and tens place are summed up, equals 999, and when the digits in the tens place and hundreds place are summed up, equals 99. Let's denote the two three-digit numbers as \( \overline{abc} \) and \( \overline{def} \), where \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) are the digits of the numbers.

The conditions given are:
1. The sum of the digits in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately, when the digits in the units place and tens place are summed up, equals 999.
2. The sum of the digits in the tens place and hundreds place separately, when the digits in the tens place and hundreds place are summed up, equals 99.

This can be written as:
\[ a + d = 9 \]
\[ b + e = 9 \]
\[ c + f = 99 \]

Since \( c + f = 99 \), the only possible values for \( c \) and \( f \) are 9 and 9 (or 99 and 0, but since we are dealing with three-digit numbers, we use 9 and 9).

So, the numbers are \( \overline{a99} \) and \( \overline{d99} \). We also know that the sum of the digits in the units place and tens place of the two numbers, when summed up, equals 999. This means:
\[ a + d = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]

So, the numbers are \( 891 \) and \( 998 \). Let's check the conditions:
1. The sum of the digits in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately, when the digits in the units place and tens place are summed up, equals 999.
\[ 8 + 9 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 43 \]
\[ 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 45 \]
\[ 8 + 9 + 9 = 26 \]
\[ 9 + 9 + 8 = 26 \]
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]

2. The sum of the digits in the tens place and hundreds place separately, when the digits in the tens place and hundreds place are summed up, equals 99.
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]
\[ 1 + 9 = 10 \]
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]

So, the numbers are \( 891 \) and \( 998 \).

"To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by expressing each equation in exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\).

We can rewrite these equations as:
\[x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2},\]
\[y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3},\]
\[z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}.\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:
\[x \cdot y \cdot z = (yz \cdot \sqrt{2}) \cdot (xz \cdot 2^{1/3}) \cdot (xy \cdot 2^{1/4}).\]
This simplifies to:
\[xyz = x^2 y^2 z^2 \cdot 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}.\]
Since \(x, y, z \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(xyz\):
\[1 = xyz \cdot 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}.\]
We need to find the value of the exponent of 2:
\[1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.\]
So we have:
\[1 = xyz \cdot 2^{13/12}.\]
This implies:
\[xyz = 2^{-13/12}.\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\):
\[\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2((xyz)^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}) = \log_2((2^{-13/12})^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}) = \log_2(2^{-13/3} \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}).\]
Since \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\) and \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\), we substitute \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\):
\[y = x \cdot (xy \cdot 2^{1/4}) \cdot 2^{1/3} = x^2 y \cdot 2^{1/4 + 1/3} = x^2 y \cdot 2^{7/12}.\]
This simplifies to:
\[y(1 - x^2 \cdot 2^{7/12}) = 0.\]
Since \(y \neq 0\), we have:
\[1 = x^2 \cdot 2^{7/12}.\]
So:
\[x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \implies x = 2^{-7/24}.\]
Then:
\[y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3} = 2^{-7/24} \cdot (2^{-7/24} y \cdot 2^{1/4}) \cdot 2^{1/3} = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} y \cdot 2^{1/4 + 1/3} = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} y \cdot 2^{7/12} = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{7/12} y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot","[2, '2']",33,"[33, '33']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the median of the hexagon \(ABCDEF\) given the lengths of the medians of the triangles formed by the diagonals and sides of the hexagon.

First, let's denote the vertices of the hexagon as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) in order. The diagonals \(AD, BE, CF\) intersect at a common point, dividing the hexagon into three triangles: \(ABD, BCE, CDF\).

The medians of these triangles are given as follows:
- The median of triangle \(ABD\) is 200.
- The median of triangle \(BCE\) is 240.
- The median of triangle \(CDF\) is 300.

The median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In this case, the medians of the triangles \(ABD, BCE, CDF\) intersect at the centroid of the hexagon, which is also the common point of the diagonals \(AD, BE, CF\).

The length of the median of a triangle is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula:
\[ \text{Median} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2} \]
where \(a, b, c\) are the sides of the triangle.

However, in this problem, we are given the lengths of the medians of the triangles formed by the diagonals and sides of the hexagon, and we need to find the length of the median of the hexagon, which is the line segment joining the midpoints of opposite sides of the hexagon.

The length of the median of the hexagon is the average of the lengths of the medians of the triangles:
\[ \text{Median of the hexagon} = \frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = \frac{740}{3} = 246.67 \]

Therefore, the length of the median of the hexagon is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the sets \(A\) and \(B\). The problem states that each element of set \(B\) is a divisor of the corresponding element in set \(A\).

The sum of the elements in set \(B\) is the sum of the divisors of the elements in set \(A\). Since each element in \(B\) is a divisor of the corresponding element in \(A\), the sum of the elements in \(B\) is simply the sum of the elements in \(A\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( Q \) and \( R \) such that their sum is minimized, given the constraints. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number.
   - The digits of \( N \) that are 1 are replaced by 7.
   - The sum of the digits of \( N \) is 1000.
   - We need to find \( Q \) and \( R \) such that \( Q + R = 1000 \) and \( N \) is the smallest possible number.

2. **Formulating the Problem:**
   - Let \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are the digits of \( N \).
   - The sum of the digits of \( N \) is \( a + b + c + d = 1000 \).
   - The digits that are 1 are replaced by 7. Let \( k \) be the number of digits that are 1. Then, the sum of the digits after replacement is \( (a + b + c + d) - k + 7k = 1000 + 6k \).

3. **Minimizing \( N \):**
   - To minimize \( N \), we should maximize the number of zeros in \( N \) because the place value of a digit increases as its position moves to the left.
   - Let \( N \) have \( k \) digits equal to 1. Then, the sum of the digits after replacement is \( 1000 + 6k \).
   - Since \( N \) is a four-digit number, \( k \) must be such that \( 1000 + 6k \) is a valid sum of digits for a four-digit number.

4. **Finding the Minimum \( N \):**
   - The smallest possible value for \( N \) occurs when \( k \) is maximized, but \( N \) must still be a four-digit number.
   - The maximum value for \( k \) is 166 because \( 1000 + 6 \times 166 = 1996 \), which is not a valid sum for a four-digit number.
   - Therefore, the maximum valid \( k \) is 165, giving \( 1000 + 6 \times 165 = 1990 \).

5. **Constructing \( N \):**
   - With \( k = 165 \), the sum of the digits is 1990, which is not possible for a four-digit number.
   - We need to adjust \( k \) to find a valid four-digit number.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of the radii of the two toruses and then find the difference between these radii.

First, let's identify the radii of the toruses. The radius of the first torus \( T \) is given as 3, and the radius of the second torus \( S \) is given as 11. The problem states that the difference in the radii of the two toruses is a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\), and we need to find \( m + n \).

The difference in the radii is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 3 - 11 = -8 \]

Since the problem asks for the absolute value of the difference, we have:
\[ |r_i - r_o| = 8 \]

This can be written as:
\[ \frac{m}{n} = \frac{8}{1} \]

Here, \( m = 8 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 8 + 1 = 9 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]","[9, '9']",127,"[127, '127']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how to distribute 25 coins into 5x5 matrices (25 coins in a 5x5 grid) such that the conditions are met. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have 25 coins.
   - We need to distribute these coins into 5x5 matrices.
   - We need to ensure that the distribution meets the given conditions.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The number of coins in each matrix should be equal.
   - The matrices should be arranged in a specific way to meet the conditions.

3. **Distribution:**
   - Since we have 25 coins and we need to distribute them into 5x5 matrices, each matrix will have exactly 5 coins (because \(25 / 5 = 5\)).

4. **Arrangement:**
   - We need to arrange these matrices in a way that meets the conditions.
   - The condition ""visi兰etats rindas unies"" means that each matrix should have exactly one coin in each row and each column.
   - This is equivalent to arranging the matrices such that each matrix is a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5.

5. **Example Arrangement:**
   - One possible arrangement is to place the coins in the following matrices:
     - Matrix 1: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
     - Matrix 2: (2, 3, 4, 5, 1)
     - Matrix 3: (3, 4, 5, 1, 2)
     - Matrix 4: (4, 5, 1, 2, 3)
     - Matrix 5: (5, 1, 2, 3, 4)
   - This arrangement ensures that each matrix has exactly one coin in each row and each column.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of coins in each matrix is 5.
   - The matrices are arranged such that each matrix is a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5.

Therefore, the number of coins in each matrix is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",902,"[902, '902']",False
