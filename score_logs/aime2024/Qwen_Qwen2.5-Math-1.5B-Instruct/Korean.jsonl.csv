"1. Let's denote the time it takes for the girl to finish the work alone as \( s \) hours and the time it takes for the boy to finish the work alone as \( t \) hours.
2. According to the problem, when the girl works alone for \( s \) hours, the boy works for \( t \) hours and completes the work. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   \frac{s}{9} + \frac{t}{6} = 1
   \]
3. When the girl works alone for \( s+2 \) hours, the boy works for \( t \) hours and completes the work. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   \frac{s+2}{9} + \frac{t}{6} = 1
   \]
4. We now have a system of linear equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   \frac{s}{9} + \frac{t}{6} = 1 \\
   \frac{s+2}{9} + \frac{t}{6} = 1
   \end{cases}
   \]
5. Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( \frac{t}{6} \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{s+2}{9} + \frac{t}{6} \right) - \left( \frac{s}{9} + \frac{t}{6} \right) = 1 - 1

"Given a triangle \(ABC\) with circumcircle \(\omega\), the line \(AD\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\), and \(P\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the line \(BC\). We are given that \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). We need to find the length of \(AP\) and express it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), and then find \(m + n\).

First, we calculate the area of triangle \(ABC\) using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \(s\) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]
The area \(K\) of the triangle is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
The altitude \(AD\) from \(A\) to \(BC\) can be found using the area formula \(K = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AD\):
\[
6\sqrt{14} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times AD \implies AD = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]
Next, we use the formula for the length of the altitude in terms of the sides of the triangle:
\[
AD = \frac{2K}{BC} = \frac{2 \times 6\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]
Now, we use the fact that \(P\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to \(BC\), and \(AP\) is the same as \(AD\) because \(P\) is the same point as \(D\). Therefore, the length of \(AP\) is:
\[
AP = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]
Since \(AP\) is already in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 4\sqrt{14}\) and \(n = 3\), we need to rationalize the numerator. However, since the problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator in the simplest form, we have:
\[
m = 4\sqrt{14}, \quad n = 3
\]
The sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 4\sqrt{14} + 3
\]
Since the problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator in the simplest form, we have:
\[
m + n = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that all vertices of a randomly chosen triangle from a set of vertices of a regular polygon are vertices of the original polygon. Let's denote the number of sides of the original polygon by \( n \).

1. **Count the total number of triangles that can be formed by choosing 3 vertices from \( n \) vertices:**
   The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from \( n \) vertices is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
   \[
   \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}
   \]

2. **Count the number of triangles that are subsets of the original polygon:**
   Since the original polygon is regular, any subset of 3 vertices will form a triangle that is a subset of the original polygon. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from \( n \) vertices is again \( \binom{n}{3} \).

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that a randomly chosen triangle is a subset of the original polygon is the ratio of the number of triangles that are subsets of the original polygon to the total number of triangles that can be formed. Since these two quantities are the same, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{\binom{n}{3}}{\binom{n}{3}} = 1
   \]
   However, this is not the correct interpretation of the problem. The problem asks for the probability that all vertices of the triangle are vertices of the original polygon, which is always true for any triangle formed by choosing 3 vertices from the original polygon. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{\binom{n}{3}}{\binom{n}{3}} = 1
   \]
   But we need to express this probability in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers. Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), so \( m + n = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

"To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then use these to find the intersection points of the given equations.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

We need to find the intersection points of the equations:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

Let's start by analyzing \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = x - \frac{1}{2} \)
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - x \)
- For \( x < 0 \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} + x \)

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \( x \):
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = x - \frac{1}{4} \)
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - x \)
- For \( x < 0 \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} + x \)

### Step 3: Evaluate \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2\pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, we need to consider the values of \( f(x) \) in this range:
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \sin(2\pi x) - \frac{1}{2} \)
- For \( 0 \leq \sin(2\pi x) < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - \sin(2\pi x) \)
- For \( \sin(2\pi x) < 0 \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} + \sin(2\pi x) \)

### Step 4: Evaluate \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
We need to consider the values of \( g(x) \) based on the range of \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \)
- If \( 0 \leq f(\sin(2\pi x)) < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)
- If \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) < 0 \), \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} + f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)

### Step 5: Evaluate \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \)
Similarly, since \( \cos(3\pi y) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, we need to consider the values of \( f(x) \) in this range:
- For \( \cos(3\pi y) \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \cos(3\pi y) - \frac{1}{2} \)
- For \( 0 \leq \cos(3\pi y) < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - \cos(3\pi y) \)
- For \( \cos(3\pi y) < 0 \), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} + \cos(3\pi y) \)

### Step 6: Evaluate \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
We need to consider the values of \( g(x) \) based on the range of \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
- If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \)
- If \( 0 \leq f(\cos(3\pi y)) < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3\pi y)) \)
- If \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) < 0 \), \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} + f(\cos(3\pi y)) \)

### Step 7: Solve the Equations
We need to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \]

By analyzing the ranges and the behavior of the functions, we find that the only solution that satisfies both equations is:
\[ x = y = 0 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( p \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) and then find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( p \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \).

First, let's consider the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We need to find \( n \) such that \( p \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). This means:
\[ n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \]

We need to find the smallest positive \( n \) that satisfies this congruence. Let's test small values of \( n \):

1. For \( n = 1 \):
   \[ 1^4 + 1 = 2 \]
   So, \( p \) must divide 2. The only prime \( p \) that divides 2 is \( p = 2 \).

2. For \( n = 2 \):
   \[ 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \]
   So, \( p \) must divide 17. The only prime \( p \) that divides 17 is \( p = 17 \).

3. For \( n = 3 \):
   \[ 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82 \]
   So, \( p \) must divide 82. The prime factors of 82 are 2 and 41. Since \( p \) must be a prime number, \( p \) could be 2 or 41. However, we need to check if \( p = 41 \) works for smaller \( n \).

4. For \( n = 4 \):
   \[ 4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257 \]
   So, \( p \) must divide 257. The number 257 is a prime number.

From the above, we see that the smallest \( n \) that works for \( p = 2 \) is \( n = 1 \). For \( p = 17 \), the smallest \( n \) is \( n = 2 \). For \( p = 41 \), the smallest \( n \) is \( n = 3 \). For \( p = 257 \), the smallest \( n \) is \( n = 4 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( p \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \). By the same reasoning, the smallest \( m \) will be the same as the smallest \( n \) for the same \( p \).

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( p \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \) is the same as the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( p \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \).

"Given the parallelogram \(ABCD\) with \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the distance from the intersection \(I\) of the diagonals to the sides of the parallelogram, which are equal, and express this distance in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\). Here, \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers, \(m\) and \(p\) are coprime, and \(n\) is square-free. We need to find \(m + n + p\).

First, we note that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Let \(O\) be the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). Then \(AO = OC = \frac{\sqrt{80}}{2} = 2\sqrt{5}\) and \(BO = OD = \frac{\sqrt{80}}{2} = 2\sqrt{5}\).

Next, we use the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram divide it into four triangles of equal area. We can use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ABD\) to find the cosine of the angle \(\theta\) between \(AB\) and \(AD\).

In \(\triangle ABD\),
\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AD \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]
\[
80 = 41 + 89 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{41} \cdot \sqrt{89} \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]
\[
80 = 130 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{41 \cdot 89} \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]
\[
50 = 2 \cdot \sqrt{3649} \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{25}{\sqrt{3649}}
\]

Now, we use the fact that the distance from the intersection of the diagonals to a side of the parallelogram is half the height of the parallelogram. The height \(h\) of the parallelogram can be found using the area formula. The area \(K\) of the parallelogram can be found using the formula involving the diagonals and the sine of the angle between them:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot BD \cdot \sin(\theta)
\]
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{80} \cdot \sqrt{80} \cdot \sin(\theta)
\]
\[
K = 40 \sin(\theta)
\]

We also know that the area can be expressed as the product of the base and the height:
\[
K = AB \cdot h
\]
\[
40 \sin(\theta) = \sqrt{41} \cdot h
\]
\[
h = \frac{40 \sin(\theta)}{\sqrt{41}}
\]

Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\), we get:
\[
\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \left(\frac{25}{\sqrt{3649}}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{625}{3649} = \frac{2024}{3649}
\]
\[
\sin(\theta) = \sqrt{\frac{2024}{3649}} = \frac{2\sqrt{506}}{61}
\]

Thus,
\[
h = \frac{40 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{506}}{61}}{\sqrt{41}} = \frac{80\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{80\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{80 \cdot \sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{80\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{80\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{80\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{80\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{80\sqrt{12.5}}{61}
\]

The distance from the intersection of the diagonals to the sides of the parallelogram is half of this height:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{h}{2} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61}
\]

Thus, the distance is \(\frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61}\).

Therefore, the distance is \(\frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61}\).

Thus, the distance is \(\frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61}\).

Thus, the distance is \(\frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61} = \frac{40\sqrt{506}}{61\sqrt{41}} = \frac{40\sqrt{12.5}}{61}\).

"1. 设 $\mathcal{B}$ be the base of the pyramid with area $54$ and height $23$. The volume of the pyramid is given by:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 \times 23 = 414
   \]

2. Let $r$ be the radius of the sphere inscribed in the pyramid. The volume of the pyramid can also be expressed in terms of the radius of the inscribed sphere and the surface area of the pyramid. The surface area of the pyramid consists of the base and the four triangular faces. The area of the base is $54$, and the area of each triangular face can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   \[
   \text{Area of one triangular face} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Let the base of each triangular face be $a$ and the height be $h$. Then:
   \[
   \text{Area of one triangular face} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
   \]
   Since there are four triangular faces, the total area of the triangular faces is:
   \[
   4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = 2ah
   \]
   Therefore, the total surface area of the pyramid is:
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} = 54 + 2ah
   \]

3. The volume of the pyramid can also be expressed as:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Surface Area} \times r = \frac{1}{3} \times (54 + 2ah) \times r
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for the volume, we get:
   \[
   414 = \frac{1}{3} \times (54 + 2ah) \times r
   \]
   Solving for $r$, we get:
   \[
   r = \frac{3 \times 414}{54 + 2ah} = \frac{1242}{54 + 2ah}
   \]

4. To find the minimum value of $r$, we need to maximize the surface area of the pyramid. The maximum surface area occurs when the triangular faces are isosceles triangles with the base $a$ and height $h$. The height $h$ of the triangular face can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Substituting $h$ into the surface area formula, we get:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area} = 54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Substituting this into the volume formula, we get:
   \[
   414 = \frac{1}{3} \times \left(54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2}\right) \times r
   \]
   Solving for $r$, we get:
   \[
   r = \frac{1242}{54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2}}
   \]

5. To find the minimum value of $r$, we need to solve the equation:
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{1242^2}{(54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2})^2}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{1242^2}{(54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2})^2}
   \]
   Solving for $r^2$, we get:
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{1242^2}{(54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2})^2}
   \]

6. The minimum value of $r^2$ is $\frac{1242^2}{(54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2})^2}$. Therefore, $p = 1242^2$ and $q = (54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2})^2$.

7. The value of $p + q$ is:
   \[
   p + q = 1242^2 + (54 + 2a \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2})^2

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the value of \(xy\).

First, let's simplify the given logarithmic equations.

Starting with \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\):
\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, consider \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\):
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]
This implies:
\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Now, we use the change of base formula for logarithms. Recall that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Substituting these into our equations, we get:
\[
\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}
\]
\[
\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Let's denote \(\log(x) = a\) and \(\log(y) = b\). Then the equations become:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \frac{10}{x}
\]
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

From the first equation, we can solve for \(b\):
\[
b = \frac{10a}{x}
\]

Substitute \(b\) into the second equation:
\[
\frac{a}{\frac{10a}{x}} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{a \cdot x}{10a} = \frac{x}{10} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Now, solve for \(x\) in terms of \(y\):
\[
\frac{x}{10} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]
Cross-multiply to clear the fractions:
\[
2xy = 50

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the smallest number of tiles \( n \) such that the game ends with the last tile being removed, and the number of tiles remaining after each turn is either 1 or 4. We are given that the smallest such \( n \) is 2024.

Let's analyze the game step by step:

1. **Understanding the Game**: The game starts with \( n \) tiles. On each turn, a player removes either 1 or 4 tiles. The game continues until only 1 tile remains, which is then removed by the last player.

2. **Key Insight**: The number of tiles remaining after each turn must be either 1 or 4. This means that the number of tiles removed on each turn must be either 1 or 3 (since \( n - 1 \) or \( n - 4 \) must be a valid number of tiles remaining).

3. **Formulating the Problem**: We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the game ends with the last tile being removed. This means that the number of tiles removed must be such that the remaining number of tiles is always either 1 or 4.

4. **Mathematical Formulation**: Let's denote the number of tiles remaining after each turn as \( n_0, n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \), where \( n_0 = n \) and \( n_k = 1 \). The difference between consecutive terms must be either 1 or 3. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   n_0 - n_1 = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad 3
   \]
   \[
   n_1 - n_2 = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad 3
   \]
   \[
   \vdots
   \]
   \[
   n_{k-1} - n_k = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad 3
   \]

5. **Summing the Differences**: The total number of tiles removed is \( n - 1 \). Since each difference is either 1 or 3, we can write:
   \[
   n - 1 = a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 3
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are non-negative integers.

6. **Finding the Smallest \( n \)**: We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n - 1 \) can be expressed as \( a + 3b \). This is a linear Diophantine equation. The smallest positive solution to \( n - 1 = a + 3b \) is when \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 0 \), giving \( n - 1 = 1 \) or \( n = 2 \). However, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the game ends with the last tile being removed, which is given as 2024.

7. **Verification**: We need to verify that 2024 is indeed the smallest number such that the game ends with the last tile being removed. We can check by solving the equation \( 2024 - 1 = a + 3b \):
   \[
   2023 = a + 3b
   \]
   The smallest positive solution to this equation is when \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 673 \), giving \( 2023 = 2 + 3 \cdot 673 \).

Therefore, the smallest number of tiles \( n \) such that the game ends with the last tile being removed is \(\boxed{2024}\).","[2024, '2024']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the two smallest numbers among the four chosen numbers is less than the sum of the two largest numbers. Let's denote the four chosen numbers as \(a < b < c < d\). We need to find the probability that \(a + b < c + d\).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{10}{4}\):

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \(a + b < c + d\). Notice that for any set of four numbers \(a < b < c < d\), either \(a + b < c + d\) or \(a + b > c + d\) (since \(a + b \neq c + d\)). Therefore, exactly half of the combinations will satisfy \(a + b < c + d\). This is because for every set \(\{a, b, c, d\}\) where \(a + b < c + d\), there is a corresponding set \(\{a, b, d, c\}\) where \(a + b > c + d\).

Thus, the number of favorable outcomes is:

\[
\frac{210}{2} = 105
\]

The probability that \(a + b < c + d\) is therefore:

\[
\frac{105}{210} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the probability is \(\frac{1}{2}\), we have \(m = 1\) and \(n = 2\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 2 = 3\).

"Given the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) and the quadrilateral \(EFGH\) sharing the same center of symmetry, and knowing that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) are also collinear, we need to find the length of \(CE\) given \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

Since \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are quadrilaterals sharing the same center of symmetry, the center of symmetry (or the center of the quadrilateral) is the midpoint of the line segments joining corresponding points of the two quadrilaterals. This means that the distance from the center to any vertex of \(ABCD\) is equal to the distance from the center to the corresponding vertex of \(EFGH\).

Let's denote the center of symmetry by \(O\). Since \(A, D, H, G\) are collinear, \(O\) must lie on the line \(ADH\). Similarly, since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(O\) must also lie on the line \(DECF\). Therefore, \(O\) is the midpoint of both \(ADH\) and \(DECF\).

Given that \(BC = 16\) and \(AB = 107\), and knowing that the center of symmetry is the midpoint of the line segments joining corresponding points, we can infer that the length of \(CE\) is the same as the length of \(AB\) because the center of symmetry implies that the corresponding sides of the quadrilaterals are equal in length when measured from the center.

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is the same as the length of \(AB\), which is 107.

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{107}\).","[107, '107']",104,"[104, '104']",False

"Given that \( |z| = 4 \), we know that \( z \overline{z} = 16 \), where \( \overline{z} \) is the complex conjugate of \( z \). We need to find the real part of the expression \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]
Since \( |z| = 4 \), we have \( z \overline{z} = 16 \), so \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]
Now, let's express \( z \) in polar form as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[

First, let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows:
- \(AB = c\)
- \(BC = a\)
- \(CA = b\)

The circumradius \(R\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K}
\]
where \(K\) is the area of the triangle. For a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the area \(K\) can be expressed using Heron's formula:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]
where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle:
\[
s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}
\]

Given that the circumradius \(R = 2024\), we have:
\[
2024 = \frac{abc}{4K}
\]

We also know that the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) form an angle, and the circumradius is the same for all vertices. Therefore, the circumradius is the same for all sides of the triangle.

Since the problem states that the circumradius is the same for all sides, we can use the fact that the circumradius is the same for all vertices. This implies that the triangle is equilateral. For an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and the circumradius \(R\) is given by:
\[
R = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Given \(R = 2024\), we can solve for \(a\):
\[
2024 = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
a = 2024 \sqrt{3}

Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal, and the ratio of the sides \(m\) and \(n\) is:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = 1

Thus, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 1\), and:

The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given by \(y = \pm \frac{b}{a} x = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\).

The maximum area of the rectangle inscribed in the hyperbola is achieved when the rectangle is aligned with the asymptotes. The vertices of the rectangle will be at \((\pm x, \pm y)\) where \(y = \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\). Substituting \(y = \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\) into the hyperbola equation, we get:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{(\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{\frac{6}{5} x^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{x^2}{20} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{x^2}{20} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{x^2}{20} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{x^2}{20} = 1
\]

Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \sqrt{10}\) and \(y = \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} \cdot \sqrt{10} = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is then:

\[
BD = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{11} - (-2\sqrt{11}))^2 + (0 - 2\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{(4\sqrt{11})^2 + (2\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 11 + 4 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{176 + 12} = \sqrt{188} = 2\sqrt{47}
\]

Thus, \(BD^2 = (2\sqrt{47})^2 = 4 \cdot 47 = 188\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is \(\boxed{188}\).","[188, '188']",480,"[480, '480']",False
"To determine the total number of pieces of mail in Aimeville, we need to account for all the pieces of mail that are received by each of the 19 families and then sum them up. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the number of pieces of mail received by each family:
   - 195 pieces of mail for the first family
   - 367 pieces of mail for the second family
   - 562 pieces of mail for the third family
   - 437 pieces of mail for the fourth family
   - 234 pieces of mail for the fifth family

2. Sum the pieces of mail received by all the families:
   \[
   195 + 367 + 562 + 437 + 234
   \]

3. Perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add 195 and 367:
     \[
     195 + 367 = 562
     \]
   - Next, add the result to 562:

"Given that \(O\) is the circumcenter and \(I\) is the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\), and \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), with the exradius opposite to \(A\) being 13 and the exradius opposite to \(B\) being 6, we need to find the product \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall that the exradius \(r_A\) opposite to vertex \(A\) is given by:
\[ r_A = \frac{A}{s-a} \]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle, \(s\) is the semiperimeter, and \(a = BC\). Similarly, the exradius \(r_B\) opposite to vertex \(B\) is given by:
\[ r_B = \frac{A}{s-b} \]
where \(b = AC\).

Given \(r_A = 13\) and \(r_B = 6\), we have:
\[ 13 = \frac{A}{s-a} \]
\[ 6 = \frac{A}{s-b} \]

From these equations, we can express \(A\) in terms of \(s\) and the exradii:
\[ A = 13(s-a) \]
\[ A = 6(s-b) \]

Equating the two expressions for \(A\), we get:
\[ 13(s-a) = 6(s-b) \]
\[ 13s - 13a = 6s - 6b \]
\[ 7s = 13a - 6b \]
\[ s = \frac{13a - 6b}{7} \]

The semiperimeter \(s\) is also given by:
\[ s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \]

Equating the two expressions for \(s\), we get:
\[ \frac{a+b+c}{2} = \frac{13a - 6b}{7} \]
\[ 7(a+b+c) = 2(13a - 6b) \]
\[ 7a + 7b + 7c = 26a - 12b \]
\[ 7c = 19a - 19b \]
\[ c = \frac{19(a-b)}{7} \]

Now, we use the fact that \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\). This implies that the triangle is a right triangle with \(\angle BAC = 90^\circ\). In a right triangle, the circumcenter \(O\) is the midpoint of the hypotenuse, and the incenter \(I\) is located such that the distance \(OI\) is given by:
\[ OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \]
where \(R\) is the circumradius and \(r\) is the inradius. For a right triangle, \(R = \frac{c}{2}\) and \(r = \frac{a+b-c}{2}\).

Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), we have:
\[ OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr \]
\[ OI^2 = \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2 - 2 \left(\frac{c}{2}\right) \left(\frac{a+b-c}{2}\right) \]
\[ OI^2 = \frac{c^2}{4} - \frac{c(a+b-c)}{2} \]
\[ OI^2 = \frac{c^2}{4} - \frac{ca + cb - c^2}{2} \]
\[ OI^2 = \frac{c^2}{4} - \frac{2ca + 2cb - 2c^2}{4} \]
\[ OI^2 = \frac{c^2 - 2ca - 2cb + 2c^2}{4} \]
\[ OI^2 = \frac{3c^2 - 2ca - 2cb}{4} \]

Since \(IA\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\), we have:
\[IA = \frac{ab}{c}\]

Given \(IA \perp OI\), we have:
\[ \left(\frac{ab}{c}\right)^2 + OI^2 = R^2 \]
\[ \left(\frac{ab}{c}\right)^2 + \frac{3c^2 - 2ca - 2cb}{4} = \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2 \]
\[ \frac{a^2b^2}{c^2} + \frac{3c^2 - 2ca - 2cb}{4} = \frac{c^2}{4} \]
\[ 4a^2b^2 + 3c^2 - 2ca - 2cb = c^2 \]
\[ 4a^2b^2 + 2c^2 - 2ca - 2cb = 0 \]
\[ 2a^2b^2 + c^2 - ca - cb = 0 \]

Since \(c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\), we substitute \(c\) and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). After solving, we find:
\[ AB \cdot AC = 84 \]

Thus, the product \(AB \cdot AC\) is:

"Given the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We know this equals 6,000,000, so:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]

Now, let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then \(a + b + c = 3a = 300\), so \(a = 100\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equation for \(abc\), we get:
\[abc = 100(100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100) - 2,000,000 = 100(3 \cdot 10,000) - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.\]
This satisfies the equation, so \(a = b = c = 100\) is a solution.

"Given that \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\).

First, recall that the 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). These roots are given by \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 13}\). The polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) can be factored as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x - 1)(x - \omega)(x - \omega^2) \cdots (x - \omega^{12}).
\]

We need to evaluate the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). This means that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity. We can rewrite the product as:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

To simplify this, consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to evaluate the product \(P(\omega^k)\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\):
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(P(x)\) can be written in terms of its roots. The polynomial \(P(x)\) can be factored as:
\[
P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2 = (x - \alpha)(x - \beta),
\]
where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0\). Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[
x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2i}{2} = 1 \pm i.
\]
Thus, the roots are \(\alpha = 1 + i\) and \(\beta = 1 - i\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[
P(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).
\]

Now, we need to evaluate the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} ((\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))).
\]

This can be separated into two products:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} P(\omega^k) = \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \right) \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \right).
\]

Each of these products is a polynomial evaluated at the roots of unity. The polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) evaluated at \(x = 1 + i\) and \(x = 1 - i\) gives:
\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1.
\]

Since \((1 + i)^{13} = (1 - i)^{13} = -1\) (because \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\) are complex conjugates and their 13th powers are also complex conjugates), we have:
\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2.
\]

Thus, the product is:
\[
\left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \right) \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \right) = (-2)(-2) = 4.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there exists a number \( n \) with exactly two digits in base \( b \) whose digits sum to the square root of \( n \).

Let's denote the number \( n \) in base \( b \) as \( ab \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \). The value of \( n \) in decimal is \( ab_b = ab \). The sum of the digits is \( a + b \), and we need this sum to be equal to the square root of \( n \). Therefore, we have:
\[ a + b = \sqrt{ab} \]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) are digits in base \( b \), they must satisfy \( 0 \le a, b < b \). However, since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), \( a \) must be at least 1. Also, since \( a + b = \sqrt{ab} \), \( ab \) must be a perfect square.

Let's test small values of \( b \) to find the smallest \( b \) that satisfies these conditions.

1. **For \( b = 2 \):**
   - The only possible two-digit number in base 2 is 11, which is 3 in decimal.
   - The sum of the digits is \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), but \( \sqrt{3} \) is not an integer.
   - Therefore, \( b = 2 \) does not work.

2. **For \( b = 3 \):**
   - The possible two-digit numbers in base 3 are 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, and 22, which are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in decimal, respectively.
   - Checking each:
     - \( 10_3 = 3 \), \( 1 + 0 = 1 \), \( \sqrt{3} \) is not an integer.
     - \( 11_3 = 4 \), \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \) (this works).
   - Therefore, \( b = 3 \) works, and the number is \( 11_3 \).

"Given the equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We start by converting these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply these three equations together:
\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right)}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Equating the simplified left-hand side and right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]
\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

We need to find \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\):
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(x^4) + \log_2(y^3) + \log_2(z^2)
\]
\[
= 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

Using the property of logarithms:
\[
\log_2(xyz) = \log_2(x) + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z)
\]

We know:
\[
\log_2(xyz) = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus:
\[
4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

We can express this in terms of \(\log_2(xyz)\):
\[
4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

Using the fact that:
\[
\log_2(xyz) = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

We can write:
\[
4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

Thus:
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) \right| = \left| 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) \right|
\]

Finally, we find:
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) \right| = \left| 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) \right|

"Given that the hexagon ABCDEF has all its sides equal and the interior angles are 120°, 120°, and 120°, we need to find the lengths of the diagonals AB, CD, and EF.

First, let's recall that a hexagon with all sides equal and interior angles of 120° is a regular hexagon. In a regular hexagon, the diagonals that skip one vertex (like AB, CD, and EF) are equal to the side length of the hexagon.

To see why, consider the following:
1. A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex.
2. Each side of the hexagon is equal to the side of these equilateral triangles.
3. The diagonals AB, CD, and EF each span two sides of the hexagon, which is the same as the side length of the hexagon.

Therefore, the lengths of the diagonals AB, CD, and EF are all equal to the side length of the hexagon.

Since the problem does not provide the specific side length of the hexagon, we can denote the side length by \( s \). Thus, the lengths of the diagonals AB, CD, and EF are all \( s \).

   - 我们需要找到 \( A \) 的元素之和。

2. **理解问题:**
   - 问题指出，对于 \( A \) 的任何子集 \( B \)，\( B \) 包含了 \( A \) 的所有元素。
   - 这意味着 \( B \) 必须是 \( A \) 的一个子集，包含所有元素，因此 \( B = A \)。

3. **计算子集的数量:**
   - 一个包含 \( n \) 个元素的集合的子集数量是 \( 2^n \)。
   - 给定 \( B \) 包含了 \( A \) 的所有元素，且 \( B \) 包含了 2024 个元素，我们有：

"Given that \( N \) is the largest 4-digit number in the set of positive integers, we start with \( N = 9999 \). When we subtract 1 from \( N \), we get \( 9998 \). According to the problem, when we divide \( 9998 \) by 7, the remainder is \( Q \) and the quotient is \( R \). We need to find \( Q + R \).

First, we perform the division of 9998 by 7:
\[ 9998 \div 7 = 1428 \text{ remainder } 4. \]
This means that \( 9998 = 7 \times 1428 + 4 \). Here, the quotient \( R \) is 1428 and the remainder \( Q \) is 4. Therefore, \( Q + R = 4 + 1428 = 1432 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric transformations involved and use the properties of ellipses and their transformations.

1. **Initial Ellipse \( T \)**:
   - The original ellipse \( T \) has a semi-major axis of 3 and a semi-minor axis of 1.75.
   - The center of the ellipse is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

2. **Transformation to Ellipse \( S \)**:
   - The ellipse \( T \) is rotated by an angle \(\theta\) and then translated to a new center at \((11, 0)\).
   - The semi-major axis of the new ellipse \( S \) is 11, and the semi-minor axis remains 1.75.

"To solve this problem, we need to place the numbers 1 through 25 in a 5x5 grid such that the sum of the numbers in each row and each column is the same, and the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal is also the same. Additionally, the number 25 must be in the top-left corner.

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 25. The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[
S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
For \( n = 25 \):
\[
S = \frac{25 \times 26}{2} = 325
\]
Since the sum of the numbers in each row and each column must be the same, and there are 5 rows and 5 columns, the sum of each row and each column must be:
\[
\frac{325}{5} = 65
\]
This means that each row, each column, and the main diagonal must sum to 65.

Given that the number 25 is in the top-left corner, we can start by placing 25 in the first row and first column. Let's denote the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
25 & a & b & c & d \\
e & f & g & h & i \\
j & k & l & m & n \\
o & p & q & r & s \\
t & u & v & w & x \\
\end{array}
\]
Since the sum of the first row is 65, we have:
\[
25 + a + b + c + d = 65 \implies a + b + c + d = 40
\]
Similarly, the sum of the first column is 65, so:
\[
25 + e + j + o + t = 65 \implies e + j + o + t = 40
\]
We need to find a configuration that satisfies all these conditions. One known solution to this problem is the following arrangement, which is a type of magic square:

\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
25 & 2 & 9 & 14 & 11 \\
12 & 19 & 7 & 15 & 24 \\
18 & 6 & 17 & 23 & 22 \\
16 & 21 & 5 & 13 & 20 \\
4 & 25 & 10 & 1 & 19 \\
\end{array}
\]

Let's verify that this arrangement satisfies all the conditions:
1. The sum of each row is 65:
   - First row: \(25 + 2 + 9 + 14 + 11 = 61\)
   - Second row: \(12 + 19 + 7 + 15 + 24 = 77\)
   - Third row: \(18 + 6 + 17 + 23 + 22 = 86\)
   - Fourth row: \(16 + 21 + 5 + 13 + 20 = 75\)
   - Fifth row: \(4 + 25 + 10 + 1 + 19 = 60\)

2. The sum of each column is 65:
   - First column: \(25 + 12 + 18 + 16 + 4 = 75\)
   - Second column: \(2 + 19 + 6 + 21 + 25 = 73\)
   - Third column: \(9 + 7 + 17 + 5 + 10 = 58\)
   - Fourth column: \(14 + 15 + 23 + 13 + 1 = 66\)
   - Fifth column: \(11 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 19 = 96\)

3. The sum of the main diagonal is 65:
   - Main diagonal: \(25 + 19 + 17 + 13 + 1 = 75\)

Since the conditions are not fully satisfied, we need to find another arrangement. The correct arrangement is:

\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
