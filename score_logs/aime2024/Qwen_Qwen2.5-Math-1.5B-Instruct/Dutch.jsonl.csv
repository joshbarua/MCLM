"We start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information. Let \( d = 9 \) kilometers be the distance to the koffiebar, \( s \) be the speed in kilometers per hour, and \( t \) be the time in minutes that Aya spends in the koffiebar.

First, we convert the time from hours to minutes for the first scenario. Since 4 hours is equivalent to 240 minutes, we have:
\[ 4s = \frac{d}{60} \times 240 = 4d = 4 \times 9 = 36. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 4s = 36 \implies s = 9. \]

Next, we consider the second scenario where the speed is \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour and the time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes. The equation for this scenario is:
\[ 2(s + 2) = \frac{d}{60} \times 144 = 2.4d = 2.4 \times 9 = 21.6. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2(s + 2) = 21.6 \implies 2s + 4 = 21.6 \implies 2s = 17.6 \implies s = 8.8. \]

We now have two equations for \( s \):
\[ s = 9 \]
\[ s = 8.8. \]
Since these values are inconsistent, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's use the correct approach by setting up the equations properly.

From the first scenario:
\[ 4s = \frac{9}{60} \times 240 = 36 \implies s = 9. \]

From the second scenario:
\[ 2(s + 2) = \frac{9}{60} \times 144 = 21.6 \implies 2s + 4 = 21.6 \implies 2s = 17.6 \implies s = 8.8. \]

We need to find the time \( t \) in the koffiebar when the speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 8.8 + 0.5 = 9.3 \) kilometers per hour. The time taken to travel 9 kilometers at 9.3 kilometers per hour is:
\[ \frac{9}{9.3} \text{ hours} = \frac{9}{9.3} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = \frac{540}{9.3} \approx 58.06 \text{ minutes}. \]

The time spent in the koffiebar is:
\[ t = 60 \times \left( \frac{9}{9.3} - 2 \right) = 60 \times \left( \frac{9}{9.3} - \frac{18.6}{9.3} \right) = 60 \times \left( \frac{9 - 18.6}{9.3} \right) = 60 \times \left( \frac{-9.6}{9.3} \right) = 60 \times \left( -1.032 \right) = -61.92. \]

Since the time spent in the koffiebar is negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the consistent value of \( s = 8.8 \) and find the time \( t \) in the koffiebar when the speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 9.3 \) kilometers per hour. The time taken to travel 9 kilometers at 9.3 kilometers per hour is:
\[ \frac{9}{9.3} \text{ hours} = \frac{9}{9.3} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = \frac{540}{9.3} \approx 58.06 \text{ minutes}. \]

The time spent in the koffiebar is:
\[ t = 60 \times \left( \frac{9}{9.3} - 2 \right) = 60 \times \left( \frac{9}{9.3} - \frac{18.6}{9.3} \right) = 60 \times \left( \frac{9 - 18.6}{9.3} \right) = 60 \times \left( \frac{-9.6}{9.3} \right) = 60 \times \left( -1.032 \right) = -61.92. \]

"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that since \(ABC\) is a triangle inscribed in a circle, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) form a cyclic quadrilateral. The line \(AD\) intersects the circle \(\omega\) again at point \(P\). By the power of a point theorem at point \(A\), we have:
\[
AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC
\]
Given \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we need to find \(AD\) and \(AP\).

To find \(AD\), we use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\) to the circle \(\omega\). The power of point \(D\) with respect to the circle is given by:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = AD \cdot AP
\]
Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\), we have:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]
Thus, the power of point \(D\) is:
\[
DB^2 = (5\sqrt{2})^2 = 50
\]
So, we have:
\[
AD \cdot AP = 50
\]
We also know from the power of a point theorem at point \(A\) that:
\[
AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
\]
This confirms our previous result. Now, we need to find the length of \(AP\). Since \(AD = AB + BD = 5 + 5\sqrt{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
AP \cdot (5 + 5\sqrt{2}) = 50
\]
Solving for \(AP\), we get:
\[
AP = \frac{50}{5 + 5\sqrt{2}} = \frac{50}{5(1 + \sqrt{2})} = \frac{10}{1 + \sqrt{2}}
\]
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
AP = \frac{10}{1 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{2}}{1 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{10(1 - \sqrt{2})}{1 - 2} = \frac{10(1 - \sqrt{2})}{-1} = -10(1 - \sqrt{2}) = 10(\sqrt{2} - 1)
\]
Thus, the length of \(AP\) is:
\[
AP = 10(\sqrt{2} - 1)
\]
In the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), we have \(m = 10(\sqrt{2} - 1)\) and \(n = 1\). However, since we need \(m\) and \(n\) to be integers, we express \(AP\) as a fraction:
\[
AP = \frac{10\sqrt{2} - 10}{1}
\]
Here, \(m = 10\sqrt{2} - 10\) and \(n = 1\). Since we need \(m\) and \(n\) to be integers, we consider the rationalized form:
\[
AP = \frac{10(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{1}
\]
Thus, \(m = 10\) and \(n = 1\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 10 + 1 = 11
\]
Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that all the red angles are adjacent to each other in a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, where \( n \) is an even number. Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon by \( n \).

First, we need to understand the total number of ways to color the angles of the polygon. Since each angle can be either red, blue, or green, and there are \( n \) angles, the total number of colorings is \( 3^n \).

Next, we need to count the number of favorable colorings where all the red angles are adjacent. To do this, we can treat the red angles as a single ""block"" of red angles. If there are \( k \) red angles, they must form a block, and the remaining \( n-k \) angles can be either blue or green. The number of ways to choose \( k \) adjacent angles out of \( n \) is \( n \) (since we can start the block at any of the \( n \) angles). For each choice of \( k \) adjacent red angles, the remaining \( n-k \) angles can be colored in \( 2^{n-k} \) ways (since each of the remaining angles can be either blue or green).

However, we need to consider that the block of red angles can be of any size from 1 to \( n/2 \) (since if there are more than \( n/2 \) red angles, they cannot all be adjacent). Therefore, the number of favorable colorings is the sum of the number of ways to color the polygon for each possible size of the block of red angles:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n/2} n \cdot 2^{n-k}
\]

This sum can be simplified as follows:

\[
n \sum_{k=1}^{n/2} 2^{n-k} = n \sum_{j=0}^{n/2-1} 2^j = n (2^{n/2} - 1)
\]

The probability that all the red angles are adjacent is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings:

\[
\frac{n (2^{n/2} - 1)}{3^n}
\]

For a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the probability simplifies to \(\frac{1}{3^{n/2}}\). For \( n = 6 \) (a hexagon), the probability is:

\[
\frac{6 (2^3 - 1)}{3^6} = \frac{6 \cdot 7}{729} = \frac{42}{729} = \frac{14}{243}
\]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{14}{243}\), and \( m = 14 \) and \( n = 243 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 14 + 243 = 257 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then determine the points of intersection of the graphs of the given equations.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| |x| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

Next, we need to find the expressions for \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \).

### Step 1: Simplify \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \)
The function \( \sin(2\pi x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1. Therefore, \( | \sin(2\pi x) | \) oscillates between 0 and 1. We need to evaluate \( f \) at these values:
\[ f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \left| | \sin(2\pi x) | - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
- When \( 0 \leq | \sin(2\pi x) | \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - | \sin(2\pi x) | \).
- When \( \frac{1}{2} < | \sin(2\pi x) | \leq 1 \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = | \sin(2\pi x) | - \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Simplify \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
Now, we need to evaluate \( g \) at the values obtained from \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \):
\[ g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \left| f(\sin(2\pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
- When \( 0 \leq | \sin(2\pi x) | \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - | \sin(2\pi x) | \). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \left| \frac{1}{2} - | \sin(2\pi x) | - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{4} - | \sin(2\pi x) | \right| \).
- When \( \frac{1}{2} < | \sin(2\pi x) | \leq 1 \), \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = | \sin(2\pi x) | - \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = \left| | \sin(2\pi x) | - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| | \sin(2\pi x) | - \frac{3}{4} \right| \).

### Step 3: Simplify \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)
Similarly, we need to evaluate \( g \) at the values obtained from \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \):
\[ f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \left| | \cos(3\pi y) | - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
- When \( 0 \leq | \cos(3\pi y) | \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - | \cos(3\pi y) | \).
- When \( \frac{1}{2} < | \cos(3\pi y) | \leq 1 \), \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = | \cos(3\pi y) | - \frac{1}{2} \).

\[ g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \left| f(\cos(3\pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]
- When \( 0 \leq | \cos(3\pi y) | \leq \frac{1}{2} \), \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \left| \frac{1}{2} - | \cos(3\pi y) | - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| \frac{1}{4} - | \cos(3\pi y) | \right| \).
- When \( \frac{1}{2} < | \cos(3\pi y) | \leq 1 \), \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = \left| | \cos(3\pi y) | - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \left| | \cos(3\pi y) | - \frac{3}{4} \right| \).

### Step 4: Find the points of intersection
We need to find the points where \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) intersect. This means we need to solve:
\[ y = 4 \left| \frac{1}{4} - | \sin(2\pi x) | \right| \]
\[ x = 4 \left| | \cos(3\pi y) | - \frac{3}{4} \right| \]

By analyzing the functions, we can see that the graphs intersect at the points where \( x = y \). This is because the functions \( f \) and \( g \) are symmetric and the equations are structured in a way that the solutions are symmetric around the line \( y = x \).

The points of intersection are:
\[ (0, 0), \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right), \left( 1, 1 \right) \]

Therefore, the number of points of intersection is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is the largest positive integer such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) for some positive integer \( n \).

First, let's consider the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We need to find the largest \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). We will start by examining small values of \( n \) to find a pattern.

For \( n = 1 \):
\[ 1^4 + 1 = 2 \]
The largest prime factor of 2 is 2, and \( 2^2 = 4 \) does not divide 2. So, \( p \neq 2 \).

For \( n = 2 \):
\[ 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \]
The number 17 is a prime number, and \( 17^2 = 289 \) does not divide 17. So, \( p \neq 17 \).

For \( n = 3 \):
\[ 3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82 = 2 \times 41 \]
The largest prime factor of 82 is 41, and \( 41^2 = 1681 \) does not divide 82. So, \( p \neq 41 \).

For \( n = 4 \):
\[ 4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257 \]
The number 257 is a prime number, and \( 257^2 = 66049 \) does not divide 257. So, \( p \neq 257 \).

For \( n = 5 \):
\[ 5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626 = 2 \times 313 \]
The largest prime factor of 626 is 313, and \( 313^2 = 97969 \) does not divide 626. So, \( p \neq 313 \).

For \( n = 6 \):
\[ 6^4 + 1 = 1296 + 1 = 1297 \]
The number 1297 is a prime number, and \( 1297^2 = 1682209 \) does not divide 1297. So, \( p \neq 1297 \).

For \( n = 7 \):
\[ 7^4 + 1 = 2401 + 1 = 2402 = 2 \times 1201 \]
The largest prime factor of 2402 is 1201, and \( 1201^2 = 1441201 \) does not divide 2402. So, \( p \neq 1201 \).

For \( n = 8 \):
\[ 8^4 + 1 = 4096 + 1 = 4097 = 17 \times 241 \]
The largest prime factor of 4097 is 241, and \( 241^2 = 58081 \) does not divide 4097. So, \( p \neq 241 \).

For \( n = 9 \):
\[ 9^4 + 1 = 6561 + 1 = 6562 = 2 \times 3281 \]
The largest prime factor of 6562 is 3281, and \( 3281^2 = 10762961 \) does not divide 6562. So, \( p \neq 3281 \).

For \( n = 10 \):
\[ 10^4 + 1 = 10000 + 1 = 10001 = 73 \times 137 \]
The largest prime factor of 10001 is 137, and \( 137^2 = 18769 \) does not divide 10001. So, \( p \neq 137 \).

From the above, we see that the largest \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \) is 2, because \( 2^2 = 4 \) divides 2. Therefore, the largest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 = 4 \) is \( m = 2 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the center \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its vertices, given the edge lengths. The center \( I \) of the tetrahedron is equidistant from all four vertices, and this distance is known as the circumradius \( R \) of the tetrahedron.

The formula for the circumradius \( R \) of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) is given by:
\[
R = \sqrt{\frac{a^2b^2c^2 + b^2c^2d^2 + c^2d^2a^2 + d^2a^2b^2 - a^2f^2e^2 - b^2d^2f^2 - c^2a^2e^2 - d^2b^2e^2 + f^2e^2a^2 + e^2a^2b^2}{16V^2}}
\]
where \( V \) is the volume of the tetrahedron.

First, we need to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant for this purpose. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) is given by:
\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}

1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0

\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \), we get:
\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}

Calculating this determinant, we get:

288 V^2 = 288 \times 400

\[
V^2 = 400

V = 20

\[
R = \sqrt{\frac{4 \times 41 \times 80 \times 89}{16 \times 400}}

\[
R = \sqrt{\frac{41 \times 80 \times 89}{1600}}

First, let's denote the dimensions of the rectangle as \( l \) (length) and \( w \) (width). The area of the rectangle is given by:
\[ l \times w = 54. \]
The volume of the rectangle is given by:
\[ l \times w \times h = 23, \]
where \( h \) is the height of the rectangle. Since the volume is 23 and the area of the base is 54, we can find the height \( h \) as follows:
\[ h = \frac{23}{54}. \]

The largest circle that can be inscribed in the rectangle will have a diameter equal to the smaller of the length and width of the rectangle. To find the dimensions \( l \) and \( w \), we need to consider the possible factor pairs of 54. The factor pairs are:
\[ (1, 54), (2, 27), (3, 18), (6, 9). \]
The smallest possible value for the smaller dimension is 6, so we can assume \( l = 9 \) and \( w = 6 \) (or vice versa, but it doesn't matter for the radius of the inscribed circle).

The radius \( r \) of the largest circle that can be inscribed in the rectangle is half of the smaller dimension:
\[ r = \frac{6}{2} = 3. \]

Now, we need to find \( r^2 \):
\[ r^2 = 3^2 = 9. \]
We can express 9 as a fraction:
\[ 9 = \frac{9}{1}. \]
Here, \( p = 9 \) and \( q = 1 \), so \( p + q = 9 + 1 = 10 \).

Next, we use the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that \(\log_a(b) = \frac{1}{\log_b(a)}\). Therefore, we can rewrite \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\) as follows:

   - A position is called a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
   - A position is called a losing position if the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - \( n = 1 \): Alice wins (she takes the last item).
   - \( n = 2 \): Alice wins (she takes 1 item, Bob takes the last item).
   - \( n = 3 \): Bob wins (he takes 1 item, Alice is left with 2 items, and Bob takes the last item).
   - \( n = 4 \): Alice wins (she takes all 4 items).

4. **Recursive Definition:**
   - If \( n \) is a winning position, there exists a move to a losing position.
   - If \( n \) is a losing position, every move leads to a winning position.

5. **Identifying Winning and Losing Positions:**

     - \( W(1) \)
     - \( W(2) \)
     - \( L(3) \)
     - \( W(4) \)

   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 4 \) (winning position), so \( n = 5 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(5) \)

   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 5 \) (winning position), so \( n = 6 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(6) \)

   - For \( n = 7 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 6 \) (winning position), so \( n = 7 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(7) \)

   - For \( n = 8 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 4 \) (winning position), so \( n = 8 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(8) \)

   - For \( n = 9 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 8 \) (winning position), so \( n = 9 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(9) \)

   - For \( n = 10 \):

     - \( W(11) \)

   - For \( n = 12 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 8 \) (winning position), so \( n = 12 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(12) \)

   - For \( n = 13 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 12 \) (winning position), so \( n = 13 \) is a winning position.

     - Alice can move to \( n = 13 \) (winning position), so \( n = 14 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(14) \)

   - For \( n = 15 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 14 \) (winning position), so \( n = 15 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(15) \)

   - For \( n = 16 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 12 \) (winning position), so \( n = 16 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(16) \)

   - For \( n = 17 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 16 \) (winning position), so \( n = 17 \) is a winning position.

   - For \( n = 18 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 17 \) (winning position), so \( n = 18 \) is a winning position.

   - For \( n = 19 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 18 \) (winning position), so \( n = 19 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(19) \)

   - For \( n = 20 \):
     - Alice can move to \( n = 16 \) (winning position), so \( n = 20 \) is a winning position.
     - \( W(20) \)

6. **General Pattern:**
   - From the above analysis, we observe that \( n \) is a winning position if \( n \) is not a multiple of 5.

7. **Counting Winning Positions:**
   - We need to count the number of integers \( n \) from 1 to 2024 that are not multiples of 5.
   - The number of multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).
   - Therefore, the number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are not multiples of 5 is \( 2024 - 404 = 1620 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{1620}\).","[1620, '1620']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the principal winner wins given that the four winning numbers are chosen from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \) and that the four winning numbers are distinct. The principal winner wins if either the second largest number among the four winning numbers is at least 2 more than the largest number, or the largest number is at least 2 more than the smallest number.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where the principal winner wins. We will consider two cases:

**Case 1:** The second largest number is at least 2 more than the largest number.
**Case 2:** The largest number is at least 2 more than the smallest number.

We will use complementary counting to find the number of outcomes where the principal winner does not win. This happens if the difference between the largest and smallest number is less than 2, i.e., the difference is exactly 1. This means the four numbers must be consecutive.

The number of ways to choose 4 consecutive numbers from 10 is the same as choosing a starting number from 1 to 7 (since the largest number must be at least 4 to be within the set):

\[
\binom{7}{1} = 7
\]

So, there are 7 outcomes where the principal winner does not win. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is:

\[
210 - 7 = 203
\]

The probability that the principal winner wins is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\frac{203}{210} = \frac{29}{30}
\]

Thus, \( m = 29 \) and \( n = 30 \), and the sum \( m + n \) is:

\[
29 + 30 = 59
\]

The final answer is:

"To solve for the length of \(CE\) in the given geometric configuration, we need to analyze the properties of the shapes and use the given lengths to find the unknown length. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
   - \(EFGH\) is a rectangle.
   - Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
   - Points \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic ( lie on the same circle).
   - \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

2. **Understand the implications of the collinearity and concyclicity:**
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, they lie on a straight line.
   - Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, they lie on the same circle.

3. **Use the properties of the rectangles and the circle:**
   - In rectangle \(ABCD\), \(AB = CD = 107\) and \(BC = AD = 16\).
   - In rectangle \(EFGH\), \(EF = GH = 184\) and \(FG = EH = 17\).

4. **Determine the length of \(CE\):**
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) must be between \(D\) and \(C\) or between \(C\) and \(F\).
   - Since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the circle passing through \(A, D, H, G\) must have a diameter that is the diagonal of the rectangle \(ABCD\) or \(EFGH\).

5. **Calculate the length of the diagonal of rectangle \(ABCD\):**
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 256} = \sqrt{11705}
   \]

6. **Calculate the length of the diagonal of rectangle \(EFGH\):**
   \[
   EG = \sqrt{EF^2 + FG^2} = \sqrt{184^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{33856 + 289} = \sqrt{34145}
   \]

7. **Determine the length of \(CE\):**
   - Since \(E\) is between \(D\) and \(C\) or between \(C\) and \(F\), and \(E\) is on the diagonal of rectangle \(EFGH\), we need to find the length of \(CE\) in terms of the given lengths.
   - The length of \(CE\) is the difference between the length of the diagonal of rectangle \(EFGH\) and the length of the diagonal of rectangle \(ABCD\).

8. **Calculate the length of \(CE\):**
   \[
   CE = \sqrt{34145} - \sqrt{11705}

However, this calculation seems to be incorrect based on the given problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem using the given lengths and the properties of the rectangles and the circle.

Given the complexity of the problem, let's use the fact that the length of \(CE\) can be found using the properties of the rectangles and the circle. The correct length of \(CE\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 8 rooks on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two rooks are in the same row or column. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 8 distinct objects, which is given by the factorial of 8, denoted as 8!.

The factorial of a number \( n \) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \). Therefore, we calculate:

\[
8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
\]

Let's compute this step by step:

\[
8 \times 7 = 56

\[
56 \times 6 = 336

\[

\[

"To find the real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the magnitude of \(z\) is \(|z| = 4\), and the reciprocal of \(z\) is \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

First, we substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z = (75+117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} = 300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta}.
\]
Next, we substitute \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
\frac{96+144i}{z} = (96+144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}.
\]
Now, we add these two results together:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = 300e^{i\theta} + 468ie^{i\theta} + 24e^{-i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}.
\]
We can group the real and imaginary parts:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (300e^{i\theta} + 24e^{-i\theta}) + (468ie^{i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta}).
\]
Using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we get:
\[
300e^{i\theta} + 24e^{-i\theta} = 300(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 24(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = (300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta) + i(300\sin\theta - 24\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta + i \cdot 276\sin\theta,
\]
\[
468ie^{i\theta} + 36ie^{-i\theta} = 468i(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + 36i(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = (468i\cos\theta + 36i\cos\theta) + i(-468\sin\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 504i\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]
Combining these, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]
The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]
To find the value of this real part, we note that the expression is independent of \(\theta\) because the magnitudes and the coefficients of \(\cos\theta\) and \(\sin\theta\) are such that the imaginary part cancels out when we consider the symmetry and the properties of the complex numbers involved. Therefore, the real part is simply the real part of the simplified expression, which is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration and the relationship between the inradius of the triangle and the given conditions.

Given that there are 34 tangent circles with radii 34, and each of these circles is tangent to two sides of the triangle \(ABC\), we can infer that the triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle. This is because the number of tangent circles is related to the number of tangents from the vertices of the triangle to the sides, and for a right triangle, the number of such tangents is given by the semiperimeter minus the inradius.

The semiperimeter \(s\) of the triangle \(ABC\) is the sum of the lengths of its sides divided by 2. For a right triangle, the semiperimeter is given by:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs and \(c\) is the hypotenuse. The inradius \(r\) of a right triangle is given by:
\[ r = \frac{a + b - c}{2} \]
We are given that there are 2024 tangent circles with radius 1, which means the semiperimeter of the triangle is 2024. Therefore, we have:
\[ s = 2024 \]
Since the semiperimeter is the sum of the lengths of the sides divided by 2, we can write:
\[ a + b + c = 4048 \]
For a right triangle, the inradius \(r\) is given by:
\[ r = \frac{a + b - c}{2} \]
We also know that:
\[ a + b = 4048 - c \]
Substituting this into the inradius formula, we get:
\[ r = \frac{4048 - c - c}{2} = \frac{4048 - 2c}{2} = 2024 - c \]
Since \(c\) is the hypotenuse, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):
\[ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]
However, we do not need the exact values of \(a\) and \(b\) to find the inradius. We can use the fact that the inradius of a right triangle is also given by:
\[ r = \frac{a + b - c}{2} \]
Since \(a + b = 4048 - c\), we can substitute this into the inradius formula:
\[ r = \frac{4048 - 2c}{2} = 2024 - c \]
We need to find the value of \(c\) such that the inradius is a rational number. Since the inradius is given by \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, we can express the inradius as:
\[ r = \frac{a + b - c}{2} = \frac{4048 - 2c}{2} = 2024 - c \]
Since \(c\) is the hypotenuse, it must be an integer. The only way for the inradius to be a rational number is if \(c\) is an integer. Therefore, we can express the inradius as:
\[ r = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{2024 - c}{2} \]
Since \(c\) is an integer, \(2024 - c\) must be an even number. Therefore, the inradius is:
\[ r = \frac{2024 - c}{2} = \frac{2024 - 2024}{2} = \frac{2024}{2} = 1012 \]
Therefore, the inradius of the triangle is:
\[ r = \frac{2024}{2} = 1012 \]
The inradius is expressed as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 2024\) and \(n = 2\). Therefore, \(m + n = 2024 + 2 = 2026\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a rectangle \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with its diagonals intersecting at the origin.

First, let's denote the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle as \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(B = (-x_1, y_1)\), \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\), and \(D = (x_1, -y_1)\). The diagonals of the rectangle are \(AC\) and \(BD\), and they intersect at the origin \((0,0)\).

Since the diagonals of the rectangle intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices must satisfy the equation of the hyperbola. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x_1 - (-x_1))^2 + (y_1 - (-y_1))^2} = \sqrt{(2x_1)^2 + (2y_1)^2} = \sqrt{4x_1^2 + 4y_1^2} = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}
\]

Thus, \(BD^2\) is:
\[
BD^2 = (2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2})^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to express \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) in terms of a single variable. From the hyperbola equation, we have:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

Let \(k = x_1^2\). Then:
\[
\frac{k}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

Solving for \(y_1^2\), we get:
\[
\frac{y_1^2}{24} = \frac{k}{20} - 1
\]
\[
y_1^2 = 24 \left( \frac{k}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{24k}{20} - 24 = \frac{6k}{5} - 24
\]

Now, substitute \(y_1^2\) back into the expression for \(BD^2\):
\[
BD^2 = 4 \left( k + \left( \frac{6k}{5} - 24 \right) \right) = 4 \left( k + \frac{6k}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{5k + 6k}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{11k}{5} - 24 \right)
\]
\[
BD^2 = 4 \left( \frac{11k}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{44k}{5} - 96
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(k\). Since \(k = x_1^2\) and \(x_1^2\) can be any non-negative real number, the maximum value of \(k\) is unbounded. However, we need to ensure that \(y_1^2\) remains non-negative:
\[
\frac{6k}{5} - 24 \geq 0
\]
\[
\frac{6k}{5} \geq 24
\]
\[
6k \geq 120
\]
\[
k \geq 20
\]

Thus, the minimum value of \(k\) is 20. Substituting \(k = 20\) into the expression for \(BD^2\):
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44 \cdot 20}{5} - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of diverts in the 900 woners of Aimeville that include all four types of dials: diameters, clubs, and spindles. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this number.

Let's define the sets as follows:
- \( A \) is the set of diverts that include diameters.
- \( B \) is the set of diverts that include clubs.
- \( C \) is the set of diverts that include spindles.

We are given the following information:
- \( |A| = 195 \)
- \( |B| = 367 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- The total number of diverts is 900.
- The number of diverts that include precision mowers for one of the dials is 437.
- The number of diverts that include precision mowers for three of the dials is 234.

We need to find the number of diverts that include precision mowers for all four dials, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C| \).

First, let's denote the number of diverts that include precision mowers for exactly one of the dials as \( x \), for exactly two of the dials as \( y \), and for exactly three of the dials as \( z \). We know that:
\[ x + y + z = 437 \]
\[ z = 234 \]

So, we can find \( y \) as follows:
\[ y = 437 - 234 = 203 \]

Now, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of diverts that include at least one of the dials:
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| \]

We know that:
\[ |A \cup B \cup C| = 900 \]
\[ |A| + |B| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124 \]

So, we can substitute these values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:
\[ 900 = 1124 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|) + |A \cap B \cap C| \]
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| = 1124 - 900 + |A \cap B \cap C| \]
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| = 224 + |A \cap B \cap C| \]

We also know that:
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| = x + 2y + 3z \]
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| = 437 + 2 \cdot 203 + 3 \cdot 234 \]
\[ |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C| = 437 + 406 + 702 = 1545 \]

So, we have:
\[ 1545 = 224 + |A \cap B \cap C| \]
\[ |A \cap B \cap C| = 1545 - 224 = 1321 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given information about the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) and the properties of its circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \). We are given that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \).

First, recall that the distance \( d \) between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
where \( R \) is the circumradius and \( r \) is the inradius. Plugging in the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, the distance \( d \) between the circumcenter and the incenter is:
\[
d = \sqrt{13}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). This implies that \( \triangle OAI \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OAI = 90^\circ \). In this right triangle, \( OI \) is one leg, \( OA \) is the hypotenuse, and \( AI \) is the other leg. The length of \( OI \) is \( \sqrt{13} \), and the length of \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R = 13 \). We need to find the length of \( AI \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OAI \), we have:
\[
AI^2 = OA^2 - OI^2 = 13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2 = 169 - 13 = 156

Thus, the length of \( AI \) is:
\[
AI = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}

Now, we use the fact that \( AI \) is the length of the segment from the incenter to a vertex of the triangle. The length \( AI \) can also be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle. Specifically, for a triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), the length of the segment from the incenter to a vertex opposite side \( a \) is given by:
\[
AI = \frac{2\sqrt{bc(s-a)}}{b+c}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \). However, we can use a simpler approach by noting that the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter:
\[
\text{Area} = r \cdot s
\]
and also using the formula for the area in terms of the circumradius and the sides:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Equating these two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Solving for \( abc \), we have:
\[
abc = 4Rrs
\]
Since \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we can express \( s \) in terms of \( AB \), \( AC \), and \( BC \). However, we can use the fact that the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the relationship between the sides and the inradius and circumradius. Specifically, we use the fact that:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{abc}{BC} = \frac{4Rrs}{BC}
\]
Since we do not have the length of \( BC \), we use the fact that the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the relationship between the sides and the inradius and circumradius. Specifically, we use the fact that:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{abc}{BC} = \frac{4Rrs}{BC} = \frac{4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 \cdot s}{BC} = \frac{312s}{BC}
\]
Since we do not have the length of \( BC \), we use the fact that the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the relationship between the sides and the inradius and circumradius. Specifically, we use the fact that:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{abc}{BC} = \frac{4Rrs}{BC} = \frac{4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 \cdot s}{BC} = \frac{312s}{BC} = 156
\]

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equations. We have two equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 300\)
2. \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\)

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that the second equation can be rewritten using the identity for the sum of products of pairs of variables:

\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:

\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]

We know from the problem statement that this expression equals 6,000,000, so we have:

\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:

\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]

Now, we need to find integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy both \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\). Let's test some possible values for \(a, b,\) and \(c\).

One possible solution is to assume that two of the variables are equal. Let's try \(a = b\). Then the equations become:

\[2a + c = 300 \quad \text{and} \quad 100(a^2 + 2ac) - a^3 = 2,000,000.\]

From \(2a + c = 300\), we can express \(c\) as:

\[c = 300 - 2a.\]

Substituting \(c = 300 - 2a\) into the second equation, we get:

\[100(a^2 + 2a(300 - 2a)) - a^3 = 2,000,000.\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:

\[100(a^2 + 600a - 4a^2) - a^3 = 2,000,000,\]
\[100(-3a^2 + 600a) - a^3 = 2,000,000,\]
\[-300a^2 + 60000a - a^3 = 2,000,000.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[a^3 + 300a^2 - 60000a + 2,000,000 = 0.\]

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \(a = 100\):

\[100^3 + 300(100)^2 - 60000(100) + 2,000,000 = 1,000,000 + 30,000,000 - 60,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 0.\]

So, \(a = 100\) is a root. Therefore, \(a = 100\), \(b = 100\), and \(c = 300 - 2(100) = 100\). This gives us the solution \((100, 100, 100)\).

To verify, we check both equations:

1. \(100 + 100 + 100 = 300\)
2. \(100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 + 100^2 \cdot 100 = 6,000,000\)

Both equations are satisfied. Therefore, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given conditions is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that the distance from the origin \(O\) to \(C\) is maximized among all points on \(\overline{AB}\) that lie on the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of a regular hexagon inscribed in the unit circle.

First, let's determine the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ A = \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \]
\[ B = \left( 0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \]

The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) can be parameterized as:
\[ (x, y) = \left( \frac{1}{2}(1-t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t \right) \]
for \(0 \leq t \leq 1\).

The distance from the origin \(O\) to a point \((x, y)\) on \(\overline{AB}\) is given by:
\[ OC = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{2}(1-t) \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}(1-t)^2 + \frac{3}{4}t^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}(1 - 2t + t^2 + 3t^2)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}(1 - 2t + 4t^2)} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 - 2t + 4t^2} \]

To maximize \(OC\), we need to maximize the expression inside the square root, \(1 - 2t + 4t^2\). This is a quadratic function in \(t\) and it opens upwards (since the coefficient of \(t^2\) is positive), so it achieves its maximum value at the endpoints of the interval \([0, 1]\). However, we are asked to find the maximum value of \(OC\) for points on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) that lie on the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of a regular hexagon inscribed in the unit circle.

The line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of a regular hexagon inscribed in the unit circle is a side of the hexagon, and the maximum distance from the origin to a point on this line segment is the radius of the hexagon, which is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \(OC\) is 1.

Thus, \(OC^2 = 1\), and we have \(p = 1\) and \(q = 1\). Therefore, \(p + q = 1 + 1 = 2\).

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. This means \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]
We can factor this expression as:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.\]

Now, let's consider the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, which is given by:
\[P(x) = x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2)\cdots(x-\omega^{12}).\]
The polynomial \(P(x)\) can be factored as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)Q(x),\]
where \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\).

We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]
Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). This means that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity. Therefore, we can rewrite the product as:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k \mod 13}).\]

To simplify this, we can use the fact that the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) evaluated at \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) is zero because \(\omega^k\) is a root of \(Q(x)\). Therefore, we can use the polynomial \(Q(x)\) to help us evaluate the product.

The polynomial \(Q(x)\) can be written as:
\[Q(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1.\]
Evaluating \(Q(x)\) at \(x = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\), we get:
\[Q(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})^{12} + (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})^{11} + \cdots + (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) + 1.\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial evaluated at the roots of another polynomial can be related to the resultant of the two polynomials. In this case, the resultant of \(Q(x)\) and \(P(x)\) evaluated at the specific points gives us the value of the product.

The resultant of \(Q(x)\) and \(P(x)\) is given by:
\[\text{Res}(Q, P) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]

The resultant of two polynomials \(Q(x)\) and \(P(x)\) is a constant that can be computed using the determinant of the Sylvester matrix of the two polynomials. However, for our purposes, we can use the fact that the resultant of \(Q(x)\) and \(P(x)\) is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(x)\) raised to the power of the degree of \(P(x)\) minus the degree of \(Q(x)\).

The degree of \(Q(x)\) is 12, and the degree of \(P(x)\) is 13. Therefore, the resultant is:
\[\text{Res}(Q, P) = (-1)^{12 \cdot 13} \cdot 1^{13} = 1.\]

Thus, the value of the product is:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1.\]

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 1 is divided by 1000:
\[1 \mod 1000 = 1.\]

"To determine the largest integer \( b \geq 2 \) for which there are more than 10 \( b \)-elegant integers, we need to understand the definition of a \( b \)-elegant integer. An integer \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant if when expressed in base \( b \), the sum of its digits is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

Let's denote the base \( b \)- representation of \( n \) as \( \overline{a_k a_{k-1} \ldots a_1 a_0}_b \). This means:
\[ n = a_k b^k + a_{k-1} b^{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 b + a_0 \]
and the sum of the digits is:
\[ a_k + a_{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0 \]
According to the definition, this sum must equal \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's consider the range of possible values for \( n \). Since \( n \) is a \( b \)-digit number, we have:
\[ b^{k-1} \leq n < b^k \]
where \( k \) is the number of digits in \( n \) in base \( b \). The sum of the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \) is at most \( k(b-1) \) (if all digits are \( b-1 \)). Therefore, we have:
\[ k(b-1) \geq \sqrt{n} \]
Since \( n < b^k \), we can approximate \( \sqrt{n} \) as \( \sqrt{b^k} = b^{k/2} \). Thus:
\[ k(b-1) \geq b^{k/2} \]
We need to find the largest \( b \) such that there are more than 10 \( b \)-elegant integers. Let's test some values of \( b \).

For \( b = 9 \):
- The largest \( b \)-digit number is \( 888_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 8 \cdot 9 + 8 = 728 \).
- The sum of the digits is at most \( 3 \cdot 8 = 24 \), so \( \sqrt{n} \leq 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) can be at most \( 576 \) (since \( 24^2 = 576 \)).
- We need to check how many numbers \( n \) satisfy \( n = \overline{a_2 a_1 a_0}_9 \) and \( a_2 + a_1 + a_0 = \sqrt{n} \).

For \( b = 10 \):
- The largest \( b \)-digit number is \( 9999_{10} = 9999 \).
- The sum of the digits is at most \( 4 \cdot 9 = 36 \), so \( \sqrt{n} \leq 36 \). Therefore, \( n \) can be at most \( 1296 \) (since \( 36^2 = 1296 \)).
- We need to check how many numbers \( n \) satisfy \( n = \overline{a_3 a_2 a_1 a_0}_{10} \) and \( a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + a_0 = \sqrt{n} \).

For \( b = 11 \):
- The largest \( b \)-digit number is \( 10100_{11} = 10 \cdot 11^3 + 1 \cdot 11^2 + 0 \cdot 11 + 0 = 13310 \).
- The sum of the digits is at most \( 4 \cdot 10 = 40 \), so \( \sqrt{n} \leq 40 \). Therefore, \( n \) can be at most \( 1600 \) (since \( 40^2 = 1600 \)).
- We need to check how many numbers \( n \) satisfy \( n = \overline{a_4 a_3 a_2 a_1 a_0}_{11} \) and \( a_4 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + a_0 = \sqrt{n} \).

By testing these values, we find that for \( b = 10 \), there are more than 10 \( b \)-elegant integers. For \( b = 11 \), the number of \( b \)-elegant integers is less than 10. Therefore, the largest \( b \) for which there are more than 10 \( b \)-elegant integers is \( b = 10 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration described. We are given a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) and three rectangles inscribed in it such that each rectangle touches two adjacent sides of the dodecagon.

First, let's consider the properties of a regular dodecagon. A regular dodecagon can be divided into 12 congruent isosceles triangles by drawing lines from the center of the dodecagon to each of its vertices. Each of these triangles has a central angle of \(30^\circ\) (since \(360^\circ / 12 = 30^\circ\)).

Now, let's focus on one of the rectangles. Each rectangle is inscribed such that it touches two adjacent sides of the dodecagon. This means that the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the sides of the dodecagon. Since the dodecagon is regular, the angles between the sides of the rectangle and the sides of the dodecagon are \(90^\circ\).

To find the area of one of these rectangles, we need to determine the lengths of its sides. Let's denote the side length of the dodecagon as \(s\). The width of the rectangle is equal to the distance between two parallel sides of the dodecagon that are separated by one vertex. This distance is equal to the side length of the dodecagon, \(s\).

The length of the rectangle is equal to the distance between two parallel sides of the dodecagon that are separated by two vertices. This distance is equal to the side length of the dodecagon multiplied by the tangent of \(30^\circ\), which is \(\frac{s}{\sqrt{3}}\).

Therefore, the area of one of the rectangles is:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = s \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{s^2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{3}

Since there are three such rectangles, the total area of the three rectangles is:
\[
3 \times \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{3} = s^2 \sqrt{3}

Thus, the area of the three rectangles is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",315,"[315, '315']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list given the conditions:

1. The sum of the numbers is 30.
2. The mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that is in the list.

Let's denote the list of numbers as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n\). The median of the list is the middle number if the list has an odd number of elements, or the average of the two middle numbers if the list has an even number of elements.

Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Also, since the median is a positive integer that is in the list, the median must be one of the numbers in the list.

Let's start by considering the smallest possible list that satisfies these conditions. If the list has 5 numbers, the median would be the third number. Let's try to construct such a list:

1. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear at least twice.
2. The sum of the numbers is 30.
3. The median is a positive integer that is in the list.

Let's try the list \(9, 9, x, y, z\) where \(x \leq y \leq z\). The sum of the numbers is \(9 + 9 + x + y + z = 30\), so \(x + y + z = 12\). The median is \(x\), and since \(x\) is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for \(x\) is 1. However, if \(x = 1\), then \(y + z = 11\), and the list would be \(1, y, z\), which does not have a median of 1. So, let's try \(x = 2\). Then \(y + z = 10\), and the list would be \(2, y, z\), which does not have a median of 2. So, let's try \(x = 3\). Then \(y + z = 9\), and the list would be \(3, y, z\), which does not have a median of 3. So, let's try \(x = 4\). Then \(y + z = 8\), and the list would be \(4, y, z\), which does not have a median of 4. So, let's try \(x = 5\). Then \(y + z = 7\), and the list would be \(5, y, z\), which does not have a median of 5. So, let's try \(x = 6\). Then \(y + z = 6\), and the list would be \(6, y, z\), which does not have a median of 6. So, let's try \(x = 7\). Then \(y + z = 5\), and the list would be \(7, y, z\), which does not have a median of 7. So, let's try \(x = 8\). Then \(y + z = 4\), and the list would be \(8, y, z\), which does not have a median of 8. So, let's try \(x = 9\). Then \(y + z = 3\), and the list would be \(9, y, z\), which does not have a median of 9. So, let's try \(x = 10\). Then \(y + z = 2\), and the list would be \(10, y, z\), which does not have a median of 10. So, let's try \(x = 11\). Then \(y + z = 1\), and the list would be \(11, y, z\), which does not have a median of 11. So, let's try \(x = 12\).

Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list:
\[9^2 + 9^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 = 81 + 81 + 9 + 9 + 36 = 216.\]

"To solve the problem, we need to fill in the 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the digits in each column from left to right is 999, and the sum of the digits in each row from top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\

We need to satisfy the following conditions:
1. \(a + d = 99\)
2. \(b + e = 99\)
3. \(c + f = 99\)
4. \(a + b + c = 999\)
5. \(d + e + f = 999\)

From conditions 1, 2, and 3, we can see that each column sum is 99, which is much smaller than 999. This means that each digit in the grid must be a three-digit number. Let's denote the digits as follows:
- \(a = 800 + x\)
- \(d = 100 - x\)
- \(b = 800 + y\)
- \(e = 100 - y\)
- \(c = 800 + z\)
- \(f = 100 - z\)

Now, let's substitute these into the row conditions:
1. \(a + b + c = (800 + x) + (800 + y) + (800 + z) = 2400 + (x + y + z) = 999\)
2. \(d + e + f = (100 - x) + (100 - y) + (100 - z) = 300 - (x + y + z) = 999\)

From the first row condition, we get:
\[2400 + (x + y + z) = 999 \implies x + y + z = 999 - 2400 = -1401\]

From the second row condition, we get:
\[300 - (x + y + z) = 999 \implies x + y + z = 300 - 999 = -699\]

"We start with the given system of logarithmic equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:
\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}
\]

To add the exponents, we find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
2^{13/12}
\]

Equating the simplified left-hand side and right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:
\[
xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). First, we express \(x^4 y^3 z^2\) in terms of \(xyz\):
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (xyz)^4 \cdot \frac{y^3 z^2}{(xyz)^4} = (xyz)^4 \cdot y^{-1} z^{-2}
\]

Substituting \(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\):
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (2^{-13/12})^4 \cdot y^{-1} z^{-2} = 2^{-13/3} \cdot y^{-1} z^{-2}
\]

Next, we take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-13/3} \cdot y^{-1} z^{-2})
\]

Using the properties of logarithms:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-13/3}) + \log_2(y^{-1}) + \log_2(z^{-2})
\]
\[
= -\frac{13}{3} + (-1) \log_2(y) + (-2) \log_2(z)
\]

Since we do not have explicit values for \(\log_2(y)\) and \(\log_2(z)\), we use the fact that \(x, y, z\) are positive real numbers and the symmetry in the original equations. We know:
\[
\log_2(x) + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z) = \log_2(xyz) = \log_2(2^{-13/12}) = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{13}{3} - \log_2(y) - 2 \log_2(z)
\]

Given the symmetry and the fact that the logarithms must balance out, we find:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{13}{3} - \left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) = -\frac{13}{3} + \frac{13}{12} = -\frac{52}{12} + \frac{13}{12} = -\frac{39}{12} = -\frac{13}{4}
\]

Taking the absolute value:
\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \left|-\frac{13}{4}\right| = \frac{13}{4}
\]

Thus, \(m = 13\) and \(n = 4\), and:
\[
m + n = 13 + 4 = 17

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total length of the sides of the hexagon ABCDEF given the lengths of the segments that form the sides of the hexagon when extended.

The problem states that the extensions of the sides AB, CD, and EF are 200, 240, and 300 respectively. Since the hexagon is convex and the extensions of the sides form parallel pairs, the lengths of the sides of the hexagon are the same as the lengths of the segments formed by the extensions of the opposite sides.

Thus, the lengths of the sides of the hexagon are:
- AB = 200
- BC = 240
- CD = 240
- DE = 300
- EF = 300
- FA = 200

To find the total length of the sides of the hexagon, we sum these lengths:
\[ AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 200 + 240 + 240 + 300 + 300 + 200 = 1480 \]

Therefore, the total length of the sides of the hexagon is \(\boxed{1480}\).","[1480, '1480']",80,"[80, '80']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the constraints and the relationship between the sets \(A\) and \(B\). The set \(B\) is a finite set of positive integers such that the maximum element of \(B\) is in \(A\). Bob's task is to find 2024 subsets of \(A\) that are non-empty and whose maximum element is in \(A\).

Let's denote the elements of \(A\) as \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n\). The number of non-empty subsets of \(A\) whose maximum element is \(a_i\) is \(2^{i-1}\) because each of the elements \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}\) can either be included or not included in the subset. Therefore, the total number of such subsets is the sum of \(2^{i-1}\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), which is \(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1\).

We are given that Bob's task is to find 2024 such subsets, so we need to solve the equation \(2^n - 1 = 2024\). Adding 1 to both sides, we get \(2^n = 2025\). The closest power of 2 to 2025 is \(2^{11} = 2048\), but since 2025 is not a power of 2, we need to check the next lower power, which is \(2^{10} = 1024\). Since 2025 is not a power of 2, we need to find the correct \(n\) such that \(2^n - 1 = 2024\), which means \(n = 11\) because \(2^{11} - 1 = 2047\) is too large and \(2^{10} - 1 = 1023\) is too small. Therefore, the correct \(n\) is 11.

The sum of the elements of \(A\) is the sum of the first 11 positive integers, which is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). Substituting \(n = 11\), we get \(S = \frac{11 \cdot 12}{2} = 66\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find a five-digit positive integer \( N \) such that when any of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote the digits of \( N \) as \( a, b, c, d, e \), so \( N = 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e \).

When we change any digit of \( N \) to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. Let's consider the case where the digit \( a \) is changed to 1. The new number is \( 10000 + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e \). The difference between this new number and the original number is \( 10000 - 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 10000(1 - a) + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e \). This difference must be divisible by 7. Similarly, if we change any other digit to 1, the difference must also be divisible by 7.

Since the difference between the original number and the new number is always a multiple of 7, the original number \( N \) must be congruent to 1 modulo 7. This is because changing any digit to 1 results in a number that is 1 less than a multiple of 7, and the original number must be such that this condition holds for all possible changes.

So, we have \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \). This means \( N = 7k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). The smallest five-digit number is 10000 and the largest is 99999. We need to find the smallest five-digit number that satisfies this condition. We can find this by checking the smallest five-digit number, 10000, and finding the remainder when it is divided by 7:

\[ 10000 \div 7 = 1428 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
So, \( 10000 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \). To get a number that is congruent to 1 modulo 7, we need to add \( 7 - 4 = 3 \) to 10000. Therefore, the smallest five-digit number that satisfies the condition is \( 10000 + 3 = 10003 \).

Now, we need to find the quotient and the remainder when 10003 is divided by 1000. We have:
\[ 10003 \div 1000 = 10 \text{ remainder } 3 \]
So, the quotient \( Q \) is 10 and the remainder \( R \) is 3. Therefore, \( Q + R = 10 + 3 = 13 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles tangent to the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \) respectively, and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's analyze the geometry of the situation. The torus \( T \) has a major radius of 3 and a minor radius of 1. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11. The torus is tangent to the sphere in two different ways: once when the torus is tangent to the sphere from the outside, and once when the torus is tangent to the sphere from the inside.

### Case 1: Torus tangent to the sphere from the outside
When the torus is tangent to the sphere from the outside, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 + 3 = 14 \). The radius of the circle of tangency \( r_i \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the minor radius of the torus, which is 1. Therefore, \( r_i = 14 - 1 = 13 \).

### Case 2: Torus tangent to the sphere from the inside
When the torus is tangent to the sphere from the inside, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 - 3 = 8 \). The radius of the circle of tangency \( r_o \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the minor radius of the torus, which is 1. Therefore, \( r_o = 8 - 1 = 7 \).

### Difference between the radii
The difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 13 - 7 = 6 \]

The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction representing the difference, which is already in its simplest form. Therefore, \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \), and the sum \( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \).

First, let's consider the constraints:
1. Each of the 25 items must be in its own row or its own column.
2. Each of the 25 items in the list of fives must have at least one of its fives in its own row or its own column.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to determine the maximum number of fives that can be placed on the rooster. The key is to ensure that each of the 25 items has at least one of its fives in its own row or its own column.

One way to approach this is to consider a permutation of the rows and columns. If we place one five in each row and each column, we can ensure that each of the 25 items has at least one of its fives in its own row or its own column. This is equivalent to finding a permutation of the rows and columns of a \(5 \times 5\) matrix.

The maximum number of fives that can be placed on the rooster while satisfying the conditions is 25. This is because we can place one five in each row and each column, ensuring that each of the 25 items has at least one of its fives in its own row or its own column.
