"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time \( t \) in minutes that Cada pren the camina with \( s + \frac{1}{2} \)ilmetres per hour, including the time spent in the cafeteria. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( d = 9.12 \) (distance in metres)
- \( s \) (speed in metres per hour)
- \( t \) (time spent in the cafeteria in minutes)
- \( T \) (total time in hours)

From the problem, we know:
1. When CÊØèa pren the camina at speed \( s \), the total time is 4 hours.
2. When C pren the camina at speed \( s + 2 \), the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours).

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. \( \frac{d}{s} = 4 \)
2. \( \frac{d}{s+2} = 2.4 \)

From the first equation:
\[ \frac{9.12}{s} = 4 \]
\[ s = \frac{9.12}{4} = 2.28 \]

From the second equation:
\[ \frac{9.12}{s+2} = 2.4 \]
\[ 9.12 = 2.4(s + 2) \]
\[ 9.12 = 2.4s + 4.8 \]
\[ 2.4s = 4.32 \]
\[ s = \frac{4.32}{2.4} = 1.8 \]

There seems to be a contradiction here, so let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the total time including the time spent in the cafeteria. Let's denote the time spent walking as \( T - \frac{t}{60} \) hours, where \( T \) is the total time in hours and \( t \) is the time spent in the cafeteria in minutes.

From the first scenario:
\[ \frac{9.12}{s} = 4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ 9.12 = 4s + \frac{4st}{60} \]
\[ 9.12 = 4s + \frac{st}{15} \]
\[ 136.8 = 60s + st \]
\[ 136.8 = s(60 + t) \]
\[ s = \frac{136.8}{60 + t} \]

From the second scenario:
\[ \frac{9.12}{s+2} = 2.4 + \frac{t}{60} \]
\[ 9.12 = 2.4(s + 2) + \frac{2.4st}{60} \]
\[ 9.12 = 2.4s + 4.8 + \frac{2.4st}{60} \]
\[ 4.32 = 2.4s + \frac{2.4st}{60} \]
\[ 259.2 = 144s + 2.4st \]
\[ 259.2 = s(144 + 2.4t) \]
\[ s = \frac{259.2}{144 + 2.4t} \]

Now we have two expressions for \( s \):
\[ \frac{136.8}{60 + t} = \frac{259.2}{144 + 2.4t} \]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[ 136.8(144 + 2.4t) = 259.2(60 + t) \]
\[ 19651.2 + 328.32t = 15552 + 259.2t \]
\[ 4059.2 = 69.12t \]
\[ t = \frac{4059.2}{69.12} = 58.4 \]

Now we can find \( s \):
\[ s = \frac{136.8}{60 + 58.4} = \frac{136.8}{118.4} = 1.15 \]

Finally, we need to find the time spent walking when the speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 1.15 + 0.5 = 1.65 \) metres per hour:
\[ \frac{9.12}{1.65} = 5.51 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 5.51 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} + 0.51 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 0.51 \text{ hours} = 0.51 \times 60 = 30.6 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time spent walking is 5 hours and 30.6 minutes, which is 5 hours and 31 minutes (rounding to the nearest minute).

"To solve for the length of \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), we start by noting that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at points \(B\) and \(C\). This means that \(D\) is the excenter of the triangle opposite to \(A\), and \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) extended to intersect the circumcircle again at point \(P\).

By the properties of the circle and the angle bisector, we know that \(P\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\). This implies that \(AP\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) extended to the circumcircle, and by the angle bisector theorem, \(AP\) is the same as the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle.

The length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle can be found using the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle, but in this case, we can use the fact that \(AP\) is the same as the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, which is given by the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle extended to the circumcircle.

The length of \(AP\) can be found using the formula for the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, which is given by:
\[ AP = \frac{2bc}{b+c} \cos \left( \frac{A}{2} \right) \]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(AP\) is the same as the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, which is given by the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle extended to the circumcircle.

Using the formula for the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, we get:
\[ AP = \frac{2bc}{b+c} \cos \left( \frac{A}{2} \right) \]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(AP\) is the same as the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, which is given by the formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle extended to the circumcircle.

Using the formula for the length of the angle bisector extended to the circumcircle, we get:
\[ AP = \frac{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10}{5 + 10} = \frac{100}{15} = \frac{20}{3} \]

Thus, the length of \(AP\) is \(\frac{20}{3}\), and the sum of the numerator and the denominator is:
\[ m + n = 20 + 3 = 23 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon, whose vertices are colored either black or white, can be rotated so that all black vertices end up in positions that were originally occupied by white vertices. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of colorings:**
   An octagon has 8 vertices, and each vertex can be either black or white. Therefore, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings of the octagon.

2. **Determine the condition for a valid rotation:**
   For the octagon to be able to be rotated so that all black vertices end up in positions that were originally occupied by white vertices, the number of black vertices must be equal to the number of white vertices. This is because each black vertex must move to a white vertex's position, and vice versa. Since there are 8 vertices, the only way this can happen is if there are exactly 4 black vertices and 4 white vertices.

3. **Calculate the number of valid colorings:**
   The number of ways to choose 4 black vertices out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\). This is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70
   \]
   So, there are 70 valid colorings where there are exactly 4 black vertices and 4 white vertices.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that a randomly chosen coloring is one of the 70 valid colorings is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{256} = \frac{35}{128}
   \]
   Here, 35 and 128 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), so the fraction is in its simplest form.

5. **Determine the value of \(m+n\):**
   In the fraction \(\frac{35}{128}\), \(m = 35\) and \(n = 128\). Therefore, \(m+n = 35 + 128 = 163\).

The final answer is:

"To determine the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions involved and their properties.

First, let's define the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
\[ f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}|| \]
\[ g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}|| \]

The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
x - \frac{1}{2} & \text{if } x \geq \frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} - x & \text{if } x < \frac{1}{2} 
\end{cases} \]
This means \( f(x) \) is a piecewise linear function that is symmetric around \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \).

Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
\[ g(x) = \begin{cases} 
x - \frac{1}{4} & \text{if } x \geq \frac{1}{4} \\
\frac{1}{4} - x & \text{if } x < \frac{1}{4} 
\end{cases} \]
This means \( g(x) \) is a piecewise linear function that is symmetric around \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, let's consider the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \). The function \( \sin(2\pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and takes values in the interval \([-1, 1]\). The function \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \) will take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) because \( f(x) \) maps \([-1, 1]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\). The function \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will then take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\) because \( g(x) \) maps \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\). Therefore, \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Next, let's consider the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). The function \( \cos(3\pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and takes values in the interval \([-1, 1]\). The function \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) \) will take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) because \( f(x) \) maps \([-1, 1]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\). The function \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will then take values in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\) because \( g(x) \) maps \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\) to \([0, \frac{1}{4}]\). Therefore, \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will take values in the interval \([0, 1]\).

To find the intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \), we need to find the points \((x, y)\) such that \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \). Since both \( x \) and \( y \) are in the interval \([0, 1]\), we need to find the points where the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) intersect.

By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, we can see that the functions \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) will intersect at 8 points within the interval \([0, 1]\). This is because the function \( \sin(2\pi x) \) has 2 periods in the interval \([0, 1]\) and the function \( \cos(3\pi y) \) has 3 periods in the interval \([0, 1]\), and the intersections occur at the points where the arguments of the sine and cosine functions are equal.

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \) is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",385,"[385, '385']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is the smallest prime number for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's identify the smallest prime number \( p \) for which there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

We start by checking small prime numbers:

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( n^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{4} \), \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \) or \( 2 \pmod{4} \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by 4. So, \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
   \]
   We check the values of \( n^4 \pmod{9} \):

   8^4 &\equiv 4096 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   Adding 1 to each of these results, we get:

   1 + 1 &\equiv 2 \pmod{9}.

   None of these results are 0 modulo 9. So, \( p = 3 \) is not a solution.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the incenter \( I \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to any of its faces, given the edge lengths. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the tetrahedron intersect, and it is equidistant from all four faces.

First, we need to find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \). We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant for this purpose. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\
1 & a^2 & 0 & d^2 & e^2 \\
1 & b^2 & d^2 & 0 & f^2 \\
1 & c^2 & e^2 & f^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

For our tetrahedron, the edge lengths are:
- \( AB = CD = \sqrt{41} \)
- \( AC = BD = \sqrt{80} \)
- \( BC = AD = \sqrt{89} \)

Substituting these values into the determinant, we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 89 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can simplify this determinant by performing row and column operations. First, subtract the first row from the second, third, and fourth rows:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 80 & 80 & 0 & 89 \\
1 & 89 & 89 & 89 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\rightarrow
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 40 & 79 & 88 \\
1 & 40 & -1 & 79 & 88 \\
1 & 79 & 79 & -1 & 88 \\
1 & 88 & 88 & 88 & -1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Next, subtract the first column from the second, third, and fourth columns:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 40 & 79 & 88 \\
1 & 40 & -1 & 79 & 88 \\
1 & 79 & 79 & -1 & 88 \\
1 & 88 & 88 & 88 & -1
\end{vmatrix}
\rightarrow
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 39 & 78 & 87 \\
1 & 39 & 0 & 78 & 87 \\
1 & 78 & 78 & 0 & 87 \\
1 & 87 & 87 & 87 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can see that the second, third, and fourth rows are linearly dependent (each is a multiple of the first row). Therefore, the determinant is zero, which is not possible for a non-degenerate tetrahedron. This indicates an error in our approach. Instead, we should use the correct method to find the volume.

Using the correct method, we find the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron. The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron with edge lengths \( a, b, c, d, e, f \) is given by:

\[
V = \frac{1}{12} \sqrt{4a^2b^2c^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths:

\[
V = \frac{1}{12} \sqrt{4 \cdot 41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 - (41 + 80 - 89)^2}
\]

Simplifying inside the square root:

\[
V = \frac{1}{12} \sqrt{4 \cdot 41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 - 32^2}
\]

\[
V = \frac{1}{12} \sqrt{4 \cdot 41 \cdot 80 \cdot 89 - 1024}
\]

\[
V = \frac{1}{12} \sqrt{1024000 - 1024}
\]

\[
V = \frac{1}{12} \sqrt{1023976}
\]

\[
V = \frac{1}{12} \cdot 1012
\]

\[
V = \frac{1012}{12}
\]

\[
V = \frac{253}{3}
\]

Next, we find the area of one of the faces of the tetrahedron. The area \( A \) of a triangle with sides \( a, b, c \) is given by Heron's formula:

\[
A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

For face \( ABC \) with sides \( AB = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = \sqrt{80} \), and \( BC = \sqrt{89} \):

\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

\[
A = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} - \sqrt{41}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} - \sqrt{80}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2} - \sqrt{89}\right)}
\]

Simplifying this expression is complex, so we use the fact that the inradius \( r \) of a tetrahedron is given by:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{A}
\]

Substituting the values of \( V \) and \( A \):

\[
r = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{253}{3}}{A}
\]

\[
r = \frac{253}{A}
\]

Finally, we find the distance from the incenter to any face, which is the inradius \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{253}{A}
\]

Given the complexity of the exact area calculation, we use the fact that the inradius is given by the formula:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{A}
\]

Thus, the distance from the incenter to any face is:

\[
r = \frac{253}{A}
\]

Given the problem's constraints, we find:

\[
r = \frac{253}{A}
\]

Thus, the distance is:

\[
r = \frac{253}{A}
\]

Finally, we find the sum \( m + n + p \):

\[
m = 253, n = 1, p = 1
\]

\[
m + n + p = 253 + 1 + 1 = 255
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular boxes in the set \(\mathcal{B}\) and then find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain all these boxes. The volume of each box is 23, and the total area of the faces of all the boxes is 54. Let's denote the dimensions of each box by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The volume of each box is given by:

\[abc = 23\]

The total area of the faces of all the boxes is given by:

\[2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\]

We need to find the dimensions \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy these equations. Since 23 is a prime number, the only possible integer dimensions for the box are \(1\), \(1\), and \(23\). Let's check if these dimensions satisfy the area equation:

\[2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 23 + 23 \cdot 1) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 2 \cdot 47 = 94\]

This does not satisfy the area equation. Therefore, the dimensions must be non-integer. However, since the problem asks for the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain all the boxes, we need to consider the largest dimension of the boxes, which is the diameter of the sphere. The largest dimension of the boxes is the cube root of 23, which is approximately 2.84. The radius \(r\) of the sphere is half of this dimension, so:

\[r = \frac{\sqrt[3]{23}}{2}\]

The square of the radius is:

\[r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt[3]{23}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{(\sqrt[3]{23})^2}{4} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{529}}{4}\]

Since \(\sqrt[3]{529}\) is not a rational number, we need to express it in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers. However, the problem asks for the value of \(p+q\) where \(\frac{p}{q}\) is the simplified form of the expression. Since \(\sqrt[3]{529}\) is not a rational number, we need to consider the integer part of the expression. The integer part of \(\sqrt[3]{529}\) is 8, so we can approximate:

\[r^2 \approx \frac{8}{4} = 2\]

Therefore, the value of \(p+q\) is:

\[p+q = 2+1 = 3\]

However, the exact value of \(r^2\) is \(\frac{\sqrt[3]{529}}{4}\), and the problem asks for the value of \(p+q\) where \(\frac{p}{q}\) is the simplified form of the expression. Since \(\sqrt[3]{529}\) is not a rational number, the exact value of \(p+q\) is not an integer. Therefore, the problem must be interpreted as finding the integer part of the expression, which is 3.

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we simplify each equation using the properties of logarithms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

This implies:

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

This implies:

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Next, we use the change of base formula for logarithms. Recall that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\) and \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = \frac{10}{x}
\]
\[
\frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

From the first equation, we get:

\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
\]

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
\frac{\log(x)}{\frac{10 \log(x)}{x}} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
\frac{x \log(x)}{10 \log(x)} = \frac{x}{10} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
2xy = 50

Solving for \(xy\), we get:

\[
xy = 25

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fitnuts \( n \) such that the game will always end with Bob winning, regardless of how Alice plays. Let's analyze the game step by step.

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game starts with \( n \) fitnuts in the pile.
   - Alice and Bob take turns taking either 1 or 4 fitnuts.
   - Alice starts the game.
   - The game ends when there are no fitnuts left in the pile.
   - The player who takes the last fitnuts wins.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - We need to find a pattern or a strategy that ensures Bob always wins.
   - Let's consider the possible outcomes based on the number of fitnuts left.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - If there are 0 fitnuts left, the current player loses (since they cannot make a move).
   - If there are 1 or 4 fitnuts left, the current player wins by taking all the fitnuts.

4. **Inductive Step:**
   - We need to determine the winning and losing positions.
   - A position is a losing position if any move from that position leads to a winning position.
   - A position is a winning position if there exists at least one move to a losing position.

5. **Identifying Winning and Losing Positions:**
   - Let's denote a losing position by \( L \) and a winning position by \( W \).
   - We start with the base cases:
     - \( L_0 = 0 \) (0 fitnuts is a losing position)
     - \( W_1 = 1 \) (1 fitnuts is a winning position)
     - \( W_4 = 4 \) (4 fitnuts is a winning position)

6. **Generalizing the Pattern:**
   - From any position \( n \), the next positions are \( n-1 \) and \( n-4 \).
   - If both \( n-1 \) and \( n-4 \) are losing positions, then \( n \) is a winning position.
   - If at least one of \( n-1 \) or \( n-4 \) is a losing position, then \( n \) is a winning position.

7. **Finding the Pattern:**
   - We need to find the positions that are losing for Bob.
   - Let's list the positions and determine their nature:
     - \( L_0 = 0 \)
     - \( W_1 = 1 \)
     - \( W_4 = 4 \)
     - \( L_5 = 5 \) (since \( 5-1 = 4 \) is a winning position)
     - \( W_6 = 6 \) (since \( 6-1 = 5 \) is a losing position)
     - \( W_7 = 7 \) (since \( 7-1 = 6 \) is a winning position)
     - \( W_8 = 8 \) (since \( 8-1 = 7 \) is a losing position)
     - \( L_9 = 9 \) (since \( 9-1 = 8 \) is a winning position)
     - \( W_{10} = 10 \) (since \( 10-1 = 9 \) is a losing position)
     - \( W_{11} = 11 \) (since \( 11-1 = 10 \) is a winning position)
     - \( W_{12} = 12 \) (since \( 12-1 = 11 \) is a losing position)
     - \( L_{13} = 13 \) (since \( 13-1 = 12 \) is a winning position)
     - \( W_{14} = 14 \) (since \( 14-1 = 13 \) is a losing position)
     - \( W_{15} = 15 \) (since \( 15-1 = 14 \) is a winning position)
     - \( W_{16} = 16 \) (since \( 16-1 = 15 \) is a losing position)
     - \( L_{17} = 17 \) (since \( 17-1 = 16 \) is a winning position)
     - \( W_{18} = 18 \) (since \( 18-1 = 17 \) is a losing position)
     - \( W_{19} = 19 \) (since \( 19-1 = 18 \) is a winning position)
     - \( W_{20} = 20 \) (since \( 20-1 = 19 \) is a losing position)

8. **Generalizing the Pattern:**
   - We observe that the losing positions are of the form \( 5k \) where \( k \) is a non-negative integer.

9. **Finding the Largest \( n \) Less Than 2024:**
   - We need to find the largest \( n \) such that \( n = 5k \) and \( n < 2024 \).
   - Solving for \( k \):
     \[
     5k < 2024 \implies k < \frac{2024}{5} = 404.8
     \]
   - The largest integer \( k \) is 404.
   - Therefore, the largest \( n \) is:
     \[
     n = 5 \times 404 = 2020
     \]

Thus, the largest number of fitnuts \( n \) less than 2024 such that Bob will always win is \(\boxed{2020}\).","[2020, '2020']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability thatLa Jen par setting up four numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \) such that at least two of the numbers are 2 units apart, and then determine the probability that she wins the largest prize.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to count the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that no two numbers are 2 units apart. To do this, we can think of the problem in terms of gaps between the chosen numbers. If we choose 4 numbers \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \) such that \( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 \) and no two numbers are 2 units apart, we can transform the problem by letting \( b_i = a_i - (i-1) \). This transformation ensures that the numbers \( b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4 \) are distinct and chosen from the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 7\} \) (since \( a_4 \leq 10 \) and \( b_4 = a_4 - 3 \leq 7 \)). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 7 is given by \( \binom{7}{4} \):

\[
\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = 35
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two of them are 2 units apart is:

\[
210 - 35 = 175
\]

The probability that La Jen wins the largest prize (i.e., at least two of the numbers are 2 units apart) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\frac{175}{210} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Thus, the probability that La Jen wins the largest prize is \( \frac{5}{6} \). The values of \( m \) and \( n \) are 5 and 6, respectively, and their sum is:

\[
m + n = 5 + 6 = 11

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we need to analyze the given geometric conditions and use the properties of the shapes involved.

First, let's summarize the given information:
- \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles.
- Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
- Points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle.
- \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(AB = CD = 107\) and \(BC = AD = 16\). Similarly, since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, \(EF = GH = 184\) and \(FG = EH = 17\).

Given that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, and since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(D\) and \(C\) are on the same horizontal line as \(B\) and \(A\) respectively, and \(E\) and \(F\) are on the same horizontal line as \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This implies that \(E\) is directly above or below \(C\) on the same vertical line.

Since \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, and \(AD\) and \(GH\) are parallel and equal in length, the distance between the centers of the circles formed by \(AD\) and \(GH\) is the same as the distance between the centers of the circles formed by \(AB\) and \(CD\).

Now, let's consider the vertical distance between \(C\) and \(E\). Since \(E\) is directly above or below \(C\) and the vertical distance between the top and bottom of the rectangles is the same, the vertical distance between \(C\) and \(E\) is the same as the vertical distance between \(A\) and \(D\), which is 16.

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is the same as the length of \(BC\), which is 16.

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To solve the problem of finding the number of paths in an \(8 \times 8\) grid that go exactly 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Path**: A path that goes exactly 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up in an \(8 \times 8\) grid is a sequence of 16 steps, where 8 of the steps are ""right"" (R) and 8 of the steps are ""up"" (U).

2. **Counting the Paths**: The number of such paths is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's in a sequence of 16 steps. This is a combinatorial problem where we need to choose 8 positions out of 16 for the R's (or equivalently, for the U's).

3. **Using the Binomial Coefficient**: The number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 16 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\). This is calculated as follows:
   \[

"To find the minimum value of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) for a complex number \(z\) with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
(75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Let \(w = e^{i\theta}\). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
4(75+117i)w + (24+36i)\frac{1}{w}
\]

To find the minimum value, we can use the fact that for any complex number \(a\) and \(b\), the expression \(az + \frac{b}{z}\) achieves its minimum value when \(z\) is chosen such that \(z = \sqrt{\frac{b}{a}} e^{i\phi}\) for some angle \(\phi\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the minimum value of \(az + \frac{b}{z}\) for \(|z| = r\) is \(2\sqrt{ab}\) when \(a\) and \(b\) are positive real numbers.

Here, we have \(a = 4(75+117i)\) and \(b = 24+36i\). First, we need to find the magnitudes of \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
|a| = |4(75+117i)| = 4|75+117i| = 4\sqrt{75^2 + 117^2} = 4\sqrt{5625 + 13689} = 4\sqrt{19314}

\[
|b| = |24+36i| = \sqrt{24^2 + 36^2} = \sqrt{576 + 1296} = \sqrt{1872} = 12\sqrt{13}
\]

The minimum value of the expression is then:

\[
2\sqrt{|a||b|} = 2\sqrt{4\sqrt{19314} \cdot 12\sqrt{13}} = 2\sqrt{48\sqrt{251082}} = 2\sqrt{48 \cdot 501} = 2\sqrt{24048} = 2 \cdot 155.08 = 310.16

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration and use the properties of the circles and the triangle.

First, let's denote the radii of the circles as follows:
- The radius of the largest circle is \( R = 34 \).
- The radius of each of the smaller circles is \( r = 1 \).

The centers of the smaller circles form a smaller triangle similar to \( \triangle ABC \), but scaled down. The distance between the centers of two adjacent smaller circles is \( 2r = 2 \). The distance from the center of the largest circle to the center of any smaller circle is \( R + r = 35 \).

The smaller triangle formed by the centers of the smaller circles is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) with a scaling factor of \( \frac{R - r}{R} = \frac{33}{34} \). This is because the distance from the center of the largest circle to the side of the triangle is \( R - r \).

The number of smaller circles is 2024, which means the smaller triangle is divided into 2024 smaller triangles, each with a radius of 1. The area of the smaller triangle is scaled down by the square of the scaling factor, so the area of the smaller triangle is \( \left( \frac{33}{34} \right)^2 \) of the area of the triangle formed by the centers of the smaller circles.

The area of the smaller triangle is also related to the area of the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) by the same scaling factor squared. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is scaled up by \( \left( \frac{34}{33} \right)^2 \).

The area of the triangle formed by the centers of the smaller circles is the area of the triangle formed by the points of tangency of the smaller circles with the sides of \( \triangle ABC \). This area is the area of the triangle minus the area of the three smaller triangles formed by the radii of the smaller circles. The area of each of these smaller triangles is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle at the vertex of the triangle. However, since we are only interested in the scaling factor, we can use the fact that the area of the triangle formed by the centers of the smaller circles is the area of the triangle minus the area of the three smaller triangles, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) \times 3 \).

The area of the triangle formed by the centers of the smaller circles is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) \times 3 = 3 \sin(\theta) \). The area of the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is then \( 3 \sin(\theta) \times \left( \frac{34}{33} \right)^2 \).

The area of the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is also given by the formula \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \times \sin(C) \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the sides of the triangle and \( C \) is the angle between them. However, since we are only interested in the scaling factor, we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is scaled up by \( \left( \frac{34}{33} \right)^2 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) for a rectangle \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with its diagonals passing through the origin.

First, let's consider the general form of the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. Since the diagonals pass through the origin, the vertices of the rectangle can be represented as \((x, y)\), \((-x, y)\), \((-x, -y)\), and \((x, -y)\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) (or \(AC\)) is given by the distance between \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\), which is:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2} = 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\).

Since the points \((x, y)\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]
We need to express \(y^2\) in terms of \(x^2\) to find the maximum value of \(x^2 + y^2\). From the hyperbola equation, we have:
\[
\frac{y^2}{24} = \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \implies y^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24
\]
Substituting \(y^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4 \left( x^2 + \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{5x^2 + 6x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{11x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{44x^2}{5} - 96
\]
To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x^2\). Since \(x^2\) can be arbitrarily large, we need to find the maximum value of \(x^2\) that still satisfies the hyperbola equation. The value of \(x^2\) is constrained by the fact that \(y^2\) must be non-negative:
\[
\frac{6x^2}{5} - 24 \geq 0 \implies \frac{6x^2}{5} \geq 24 \implies x^2 \geq 20
\]
The maximum value of \(x^2\) is not bounded above, but the minimum value of \(x^2\) is 20. Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44 \cdot 20}{5} - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80
\]
Thus, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is \(\boxed{80}\).","[80, '80']",480,"[480, '480']",True
"To determine the number of residents of Aimeville who see all four of these things (a diamant, a joc de pal de golf, a pala de jard√≠, and a bossa de cers de caramel), we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's define the following sets:

- \( A \): the set of residents who see a diamant.
- \( B \): the set of residents who see a joc de pal de golf.
- \( C \): the set of residents who see a pala de jard√≠.
- \( D \): the set of residents who see a bossa de cers de caramel.

We are given the following information:
- \( |A| = 900 \)
- \( |B| = 195 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- \( |D| = 900 \)
- The number of residents who see exactly two of these things is 437.
- The number of residents who see exactly three of these things is 234.
- The number of residents who see none of these things is 0.

We need to find the number of residents who see all four of these things, denoted as \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

First, let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets to find the total number of residents who see at least one of the four things:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

We know that the total number of residents is 900, and no one sees none of these things, so:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900
\]

We also know the number of residents who see exactly two, exactly three, and none of these things. Let's denote the number of residents who see exactly two things as \( x_2 \), the number of residents who see exactly three things as \( x_3 \), and the number of residents who see all four things as \( x_4 \). We are given:

\[
x_2 = 437
\]
\[
x_3 = 234
\]
\[
x_0 = 0
\]

The total number of residents can also be expressed as the sum of those who see exactly 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 things:

\[
x_0 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 900
\]

Since \( x_0 = 0 \), we have:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 900
\]

We can also express the total number of residents who see at least one of the things in terms of the intersections:

\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
900 = x_1 + 437 + 234 + x_4
\]

Simplifying:

\[
900 = x_1 + 671 + x_4
\]

\[
x_1 + x_4 = 229
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of residents who see at least two of the things. This is given by:

\[
x_2 + 3x_3 + 6x_4 = 437 + 3 \cdot 234 + 6x_4
\]

Simplifying:

\[
x_2 + 3x_3 + 6x_4 = 437 + 702 + 6x_4
\]

\[
x_2 + 3x_3 + 6x_4 = 1139 + 6x_4
\]

We also know that:

\[
x_2 + 3x_3 + 6x_4 = |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3x_4
\]

Since we don't have the individual values of the intersections of two sets, we can use the fact that the total number of residents who see at least two things is 437 + 702 + 6x_4. Therefore:

\[
x_1 + x_4 = 229
\]

Since \( x_1 = 229 - x_4 \), we can substitute back to find \( x_4 \):

\[
x_4 = 139
\]

Thus, the number of residents who see all four of these things is:

\[

"To solve for \( AB \cdot AC \) in the given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \), we can use the following steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between the circumcenter and incenter:**
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the triangle \( \triangle OAI \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OAI = 90^\circ \).

2. **Use the formula for the distance between the circumcenter and incenter:**
   The distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) in a triangle is given by:
   \[
   OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
   \]
   Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
   \[
   OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   OI = \sqrt{13}
   \]

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OAI \):**
   In the right triangle \( \triangle OAI \), we have:
   \[
   OI^2 + AI^2 = OA^2
   \]
   Since \( OA = R = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \):
   \[
   (\sqrt{13})^2 + AI^2 = 13^2
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   13 + AI^2 = 169
   \]
   Solving for \( AI^2 \):
   \[
   AI^2 = 169 - 13 = 156
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   AI = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
   \]

4. **Relate \( AI \) to the sides of the triangle:**
   The length \( AI \) is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula:
   \[
   AI = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}
   \]
   However, we can use a simpler approach by noting that \( AI \) is also related to the area of the triangle and the semiperimeter. The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle can be expressed as:
   \[
   \Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
   \]
   and also as:
   \[
   \Delta = r \cdot s
   \]
   where \( s \) is the semiperimeter. Equating the two expressions for the area:
   \[
   \frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s
   \]
   Solving for \( abc \):
   \[
   abc = 4R \cdot r \cdot s
   \]
   Since \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we need to find \( s \). However, we can use the fact that \( AI \) is related to the sides and the inradius:
   \[
   AI = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} = \frac{r}{\sqrt{\frac{s(s-a)}{bc}}}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   AI = \frac{r \cdot \sqrt{bc}}{\sqrt{s(s-a)}}
   \]
   Since \( AI = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):
   \[
   2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6 \cdot \sqrt{bc}}{\sqrt{s(s-a)}}
   \]
   Solving for \( bc \):
   \[
   2\sqrt{39} \cdot \sqrt{s(s-a)} = 6 \cdot \sqrt{bc}
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{39} \cdot \sqrt{s(s-a)} = 3 \cdot \sqrt{bc}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   39 \cdot s(s-a) = 9 \cdot bc
   \]
   Since \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \), we can use the fact that \( s(s-a) = bc \):
   \[
   39 \cdot bc = 9 \cdot bc
   \]
   Therefore, we need to find \( AB \cdot AC \):
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = bc = 168
   \]

\[
\boxed{168}

"To solve for the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We are given that this expression equals 6,000,000, so we have:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]

Now, let's consider possible values for \(a, b,\) and \(c\). Since \(a, b,\) and \(c\) are non-negative integers and their sum is 300, one of them must be relatively large to satisfy the equation \(abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\). Let's test some values.

If we assume \(a = 100\), then \(b + c = 200\). Substituting \(a = 100\) into the second equation, we get:
\[100^2b + 100^2c + b^2 \cdot 100 + b^2c + c^2 \cdot 100 + c^2b = 6,000,000,\]
which simplifies to:
\[10,000b + 10,000c + 100b^2 + b^2c + 100c^2 + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]
Since \(b + c = 200\), we can substitute \(c = 200 - b\) into the equation:
\[10,000b + 10,000(200 - b) + 100b^2 + b^2(200 - b) + 100(200 - b)^2 + (200 - b)^2b = 6,000,000.\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[10,000b + 2,000,000 - 10,000b + 100b^2 + 200b^2 - b^3 + 100(40,000 - 400b + b^2) + (200 - b)^2b = 6,000,000,\]
\[2,000,000 + 300b^2 - b^3 + 4,000,000 - 40,000b + 100b^2 + 40,000b - b^3 - b^3 + 40,000b - 400b^2 + b^3 = 6,000,000,\]
\[6,000,000 = 6,000,000.\]
This equation is satisfied, so \(a = 100\) is a valid solution. Since \(b\) and \(c\) can be any non-negative integers that sum to 200, there are 201 possible pairs \((b, c)\) (i.e., \(b\) can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 200).

By symmetry, the same analysis applies if we assume \(b = 100\) or \(c = 100\). Therefore, there are 3 sets of solutions: \((100, 100, 100)\), \((100, 100, 100)\), and \((100, 100, 100)\), each with 201 possible permutations. However, since the problem asks for the number of triples, we count each unique triple only once, so the total number of solutions is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) is not on any other segment of \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) and \(B\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) respectively. The equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) can be found using the two-point form of the equation of a line.

The slope of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Since \(C\) is on this line, its coordinates can be written as \((x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\) for some \(x\) in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\).

The point \(C\) is not on any other segment of \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\), which means \(C\) must be the point where the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) intersects the unit circle centered at the origin. The equation of the unit circle is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the circle's equation, we get:
\[
x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4 \implies 16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\):
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Since \(x\) must be in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\), we take the smaller root:
\[
x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\) back into the equation of the line to find \(y\):
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{-3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{39} + \sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
The coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{39} + \sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{39} + \sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(3 - \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{39} + \sqrt{3})^2}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{9 - 6\sqrt{13} + 13 + 39 + 6\sqrt{13} + 3}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{64}{64}} = 1
\]
Thus, \(OC^2 = 1\), and in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\), we have \(p = 1\) and \(q = 1\). Therefore, \(p + q = 1 + 1 = 2\).

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. This means \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\).

First, let's rewrite the expression inside the product:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.\]
We can factor this expression using the fact that \(\omega\) is a root of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). The polynomial can be factored as:
\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2)\cdots(x-\omega^{12}).\]
We are interested in the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) evaluated at \(x = 2 - 2x + x^2\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the properties of roots of unity.

Consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{13} - 1\). The roots of \(Q(x)\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We can express \(Q(x)\) as:
\[Q(x) = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2)\cdots(x-\omega^{12}).\]
We need to evaluate the product:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).\]
Notice that \(\omega^{13} = 1\), so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). This means that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity. Therefore, we can rewrite the product as:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k \mod 13}).\]
This is a symmetric sum over all 13th roots of unity, excluding 1. We can use the fact that the product of all non-unity 13th roots of unity is \((-1)^{12} = 1\).

To find the value of the product, we can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) evaluated at \(x = 2 - 2x + x^2\) gives us the product of the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) shifted by the terms involving \(\omega^k\) and \(\omega^{2k}\).

By properties of roots of unity and symmetric sums, we can conclude that the product is:
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1.\]
However, we need to find the value of this product modulo 1000. Since the product is 1, we have:
\[1 \mod 1000 = 1.\]
Therefore, the value of the product is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are exactly two \( b \)-elegant numbers, and the sum of their digits equals the square root of the number.

First, let's understand what it means for a number to be \( b \)-elegant. A number is \( b \)-elegant if it can be expressed in base \( b \) using exactly three digits, and the sum of these digits equals the square root of the number.

Let's denote the \( b \)-elegant number as \( \overline{abc}_b \), where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are the digits in base \( b \). This number can be expressed in decimal as:
\[ n = ab^2 + bb + c \]
The sum of the digits is:
\[ a + b + c \]
We need:
\[ a + b + c = \sqrt{n} \]

Let's start by checking small values of \( b \).

### For \( b = 2 \):
The only possible \( b \)-elegant number is \( 111_2 = 7 \) (since \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \) and \( \sqrt{7} \) is not an integer). So, there is only one \( 2 \)-elegant number.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) such that each side of the rectangle is equal to the length of one side or one diagonal of the dodecagon.

First, let's understand the structure of the dodecagon and the possible rectangles that can be formed. A regular dodecagon has 12 sides, and we can form rectangles by choosing two parallel sides and two other parallel sides that are either the same distance apart or a diagonal distance apart.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the possible side lengths of the dodecagon:**
   - The dodecagon has 12 sides, and we can form rectangles with side lengths equal to the side length of the dodecagon or a diagonal length of the dodecagon.

2. **Count the number of possible rectangles:**
   - For each side of the dodecagon, we can form a rectangle with the same side length or a diagonal length. The key is to count the number of ways to choose two parallel sides that are either the same distance apart or a diagonal distance apart.

3. **Calculate the number of rectangles:**
   - For each side of the dodecagon, we can form a rectangle with the same side length or a diagonal length. The number of such rectangles is determined by the number of ways to choose two parallel sides that are either the same distance apart or a diagonal distance apart.
   - For a regular dodecagon, there are 12 sides, and for each side, we can form a rectangle with the same side length or a diagonal length. This gives us 12 possible rectangles for each side length.

4. **Sum the number of rectangles:**
   - Since there are 12 sides, and for each side, we can form 12 rectangles, the total number of rectangles is \(12 \times 12 = 144\).

Therefore, the total number of rectangles that can be formed is \(\boxed{36}\).","[36, '36']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"1. **Identify the properties of the list:**
   - The sum of the elements is \(30\).
   - The mode of the list is \(9\).
   - The median of the list is an integer that is not in the list.

2. **Determine the number of elements in the list:**
   - Let \(n\) be the number of elements in the list.
   - Since the mode is \(9\), \(9\) must appear more frequently than any other number.
   - Since the median is an integer that is not in the list, \(n\) must be odd (because the median of an odd number of elements is the middle element).

3. **Formulate the sum of the elements:**
   - Let the elements of the list be \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).
   - The sum of the elements is given by:
     \[
     a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 30
     \]

4. **Consider the median:**
   - Since \(n\) is odd, the median is the \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\)-th element.
   - Let the median be \(m\).
   - Since \(m\) is not in the list, \(m \neq 9\).

5. **Analyze the possible values for \(n\):**
   - If \(n = 3\), the list would be \(\{a, b, 9\}\) with \(a + b + 9 = 30\), which simplifies to \(a + b = 21\). This is not possible because \(a\) and \(b\) must be different from \(9\) and the median must be an integer not in the list.
   - If \(n = 5\), the list would be \(\{a, b, 9, c, d\}\) with \(a + b + 9 + c + d = 30\), which simplifies to \(a + b + c + d = 21\). This is possible if \(a, b, c, d\) are different from \(9\) and the median is an integer not in the list.

6. **Determine the elements of the list:**
   - Let the list be \(\{a, b, 9, c, d\}\) with \(a + b + c + d = 21\).
   - Since the mode is \(9\), \(9\) must appear more frequently than any other number. Therefore, \(9\) must appear at least twice.
   - The only way to satisfy \(a + b + c + d = 21\) with \(9\) appearing twice is if \(a = b = 9\).

7. **Verify the list:**
   - The list is \(\{9, 9, 9, c, d\}\).
   - The sum of the elements is \(9 + 9 + 9 + c + d = 30\), which simplifies to \(c + d = 3\).
   - Since \(c\) and \(d\) must be different from \(9\) and the median must be an integer not in the list, \(c\) and \(d\) must be \(1\) and \(2\) (or vice versa).

8. **Calculate the sum of the squares:**
   - The list is \(\{9, 9, 9, 1, 2\}\).
   - The sum of the squares is:
     \[
     9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 4 = 248

"To solve the problem, we need to place the digits in the 2x3 grid such that the sum of the numbers read horizontally and vertically equals 999 and 99 respectively. Let's denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We need to satisfy the following conditions:
1. The sum of the numbers read horizontally should be 999.
2. The sum of the numbers read vertically should be 99.

Let's start by analyzing the vertical sums. The vertical sums are:
- \(a + d + 9\)
- \(b + e + 9\)
- \(c + f + 1\)

The total sum of these vertical numbers is:
\[
(a + d + 9) + (b + e + 9) + (c + f + 1) = a + b + c + d + e + f + 19
\]
This must equal 99, so:
\[
a + b + c + d + e + f + 19 = 99 \implies a + b + c + d + e + f = 80
\]

Now, let's analyze the horizontal sums. The horizontal sums are:
- \(100a + 10b + c\)
- \(100d + 10e + f\)
- \(899\)

The total sum of these horizontal numbers is:
\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f + 899 = 999

"To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by rewriting each equation in exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}
\]

From these equations, we can express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other. First, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{(xyz)^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12} = 2^{13/12}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(x^4 y^3 z^2\). Using the fact that \(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\), we can express \(x^4 y^3 z^2\) as:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (xyz)^{4+3+2} \cdot (xyz)^{-13/12} = (xyz)^{9} \cdot (xyz)^{-13/12} = (xyz)^{9 - 13/12} = (2^{-13/12})^{9 - 13/12} = 2^{-13/12 \cdot 97/12} = 2^{-13 \cdot 97 / 144} = 2^{-1261/144}
\]

We need to find the absolute value of the logarithm base 2 of this expression:

\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| \log_2(2^{-1261/144}) \right| = \left| -\frac{1261}{144} \right| = \frac{1261}{144}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1261}{144}\) is already in its simplest form because 1261 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 144. Therefore, \(m = 1261\) and \(n = 144\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:

\[
m + n = 1261 + 144 = 1405

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the hexagon and the extensions of its sides. Let's denote the vertices of the hexagon as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) in order. The extensions of the sides \(AB, CD,\) and \(EF\) are given to be parallel and have lengths 200, 240, and 300 respectively. We need to find the length of the side \(BC\).

First, let's visualize the hexagon and the extensions. When we extend the sides \(AB, CD,\) and \(EF\), we form three parallelograms. Let's denote the extensions of \(AB, CD,\) and \(EF\) as \(AB', CD',\) and \(EF'\) respectively. Since these extensions are parallel, the segments \(AB', CD',\) and \(EF'\) are parallel to the sides \(BC, DE,\) and \(FA\) respectively.

The key insight here is that the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides of the hexagon must be equal. This is because the extensions form parallelograms, and the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on the properties of the hexagon:

\[AB + DE = BC + EF = CD + FA = AB' + CD' = CD' + EF' = EF' + AB'\]

Given that \(AB' = 200\), \(CD' = 240\), and \(EF' = 300\), we can use the fact that the extensions form parallelograms to find the length of the side \(BC\). Since the extensions are parallel and the hexagon is equilateral, the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides must be equal. Therefore, we can write:

\[AB + DE = BC + EF = CD + FA = AB' + CD' = CD' + EF' = EF' + AB'\]

Since \(AB' = 200\), \(CD' = 240\), and \(EF' = 300\), we can use the fact that the extensions form parallelograms to find the length of the side \(BC\). The sum of the lengths of the opposite sides must be equal, so we can write:

\[AB + DE = BC + EF = CD + FA = 200 + 240 = 440\]

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the length of each side is the same. Therefore, the length of the side \(BC\) is:

\[BC = 220\]

So, the length of the side \(BC\) is \(\boxed{220}\).","[220, '220']",80,"[80, '80']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the sets \(A\) and \(B\). The set \(A\) contains all finite sets of integers, and the set \(B\) contains all finite sets of integers such that the maximum element of each set in \(B\) is also in \(A\). The problem states that Bob has 2024 sets in \(B\), and we need to find the sum of the elements in \(A\).

First, let's consider the structure of the sets in \(B\). Each set in \(B\) is a finite set of integers, and the maximum element of each set in \(B\) must also be in \(A\). This means that \(A\) must contain all possible maximum elements of the sets in \(B\).

Since Bob has 2024 sets in \(B\), and each set in \(B\) is a finite set of integers, the maximum element of each set in \(B\) must be a unique integer. This is because if two sets had the same maximum element, they would be considered the same set in terms of their maximum element, and we would count it only once. Therefore, the maximum elements of the sets in \(B\) must be 2024 distinct integers.

The smallest 2024 distinct positive integers are the integers from 1 to 2024. Therefore, the maximum elements of the sets in \(B\) are the integers from 1 to 2024. This means that \(A\) must contain all integers from 1 to 2024.

To find the sum of the elements in \(A\), we need to find the sum of the integers from 1 to 2024. The sum of the first \(n\) positive integers is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

Substituting \(n = 2024\) into the formula, we get:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{2024} i = \frac{2024 \cdot 2025}{2} = 2024 \cdot 1012.5 = 2049300
\]

Therefore, the sum of the elements in \(A\) is:

\[
\boxed{2049300}

"To solve the problem, we need to find a four-digit number \( N \) such that when any one of its digits is increased by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. We also need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000, and then find \( Q + R \).

Let's denote the four-digit number \( N \) as \( \overline{abcd} \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits. The number \( N \) can be expressed as:
\[ N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \]

We need to check the condition that increasing any one of the digits by 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's consider each case:

1. Increasing \( a \) by 1:
\[ N + 1000 = 1000(a+1) + 100b + 10c + d = 1000a + 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \]
\[ N + 1000 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 6 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N + 6 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

2. Increasing \( b \) by 1:
\[ N + 1000 = 1000a + 100(b+1) + 10c + d = 1000a + 100b + 100 + 10c + d \]
\[ N + 100 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

3. Increasing \( c \) by 1:
\[ N + 1000 = 1000a + 100b + 10(c+1) + d = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 10 + d \]
\[ N + 10 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

4. Increasing \( d \) by 1:
\[ N + 1000 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + (d+1) = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1 \]
\[ N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ N \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

From the above conditions, we see that \( N \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \), \( N \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \), \( N \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \), and \( N \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) are not consistent. However, we need to find a number that satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Let's try to find a number that satisfies all these conditions.

By trial and error, we find that the number \( N = 1001 \) satisfies all the conditions:
\[ 1001 + 1 = 1002 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1001 + 10 = 1011 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1001 + 100 = 1101 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1001 + 1000 = 2001 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

So, \( N = 1001 \) is a valid number. Now, we need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000:
\[ Q = 1 \]
\[ R = 0 \]

Therefore, \( Q + R = 1 + 0 = 1 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles around which the torus \( T \) is rolled, and then find the difference \( r_i - r_o \).

First, let's understand the geometry of the torus \( T \). The torus is generated by rolling a circle of radius 3 around a circle of radius 6. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the generating circle is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. Therefore, the major radius of the torus is 6 + 3 = 9, and the minor radius is 3.

When the torus is rolled out, it forms a rectangle with a length equal to the circumference of the circle with radius 9 (which is \( 2\pi \times 9 = 18\pi \)) and a width equal to the circumference of the circle with radius 3 (which is \( 2\pi \times 3 = 6\pi \)).

Now, let's consider the sphere \( S \) with radius 11. When the torus is rolled out, it is tangent to the sphere \( S \) in two different ways: once externally and once internally.

1. **Exterior Tangency**: When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is the sum of the major radius of the torus and the radius of the sphere, which is \( 9 + 11 = 20 \). The radius of the circle around which the torus is rolled is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is the same as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the minor radius of the torus, i.e., \( 20 - 3 = 17 \). Therefore, \( r_i = 17 \).

2. **Internal Tangency**: When the torus is tangent to the sphere internally, the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is the difference between the major radius of the torus and the radius of the sphere, which is \( 9 - 11 = -2 \) (but we take the absolute value, so it is 2). The radius of the circle around which the torus is rolled is the distance from the center of the torus to the point of tangency, which is the same as the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus plus the minor radius of the torus, i.e., \( 2 + 3 = 5 \). Therefore, \( r_o = 5 \).

The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is \( 17 - 5 = 12 \). Therefore, the value of \( m+n \) is \( 12 + 1 = 13 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",127,"[127, '127']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 25 blue tiles and 25 red tiles in a 5x5 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly 5 blue tiles and 5 red tiles.
