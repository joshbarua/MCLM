"1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( s \) be the number of terms in the first sequence.
   - Let \( t \) be the number of terms in the second sequence.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - The sum of the first sequence is given by:
     \[
     s + 2s + 3s + \ldots + 9s = 9s \left(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + s\right)
     \]
     The sum of the first \( s \) natural numbers is:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + s = \frac{s(s+1)}{2}
     \]
     Therefore, the sum of the first sequence is:
     \[
     9s \cdot \frac{s(s+1)}{2} = \frac{9s^2(s+1)}{2}
     \]

   - The sum of the second sequence is given by:
     \[
     t + 2t + 3t + \ldots + 9t = 9t \left(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + t\right)
     \]
     The sum of the first \( t \) natural numbers is:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + t = \frac{t(t+1)}{2}
     \]
     Therefore, the sum of the second sequence is:
     \[
     9t \cdot \frac{t(t+1)}{2} = \frac{9t^2(t+1)}{2}
     \]

   - The sum of the third sequence is given by:
     \[
     s + \frac{1}{2}s + \frac{3}{2}s + \ldots + \frac{17}{2}s = \frac{1}{2} \left( s + s + 3s + \ldots + 17s \right)
     \]
     The sum of the first \( s \) terms of the sequence \( 1, 1, 3, 5, \ldots, 17 \) is an arithmetic series with the first term \( a = 1 \) and common difference \( d = 2 \). The sum of the first \( s \) terms of this series is:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{s-1} (1 + 2k) = s + 2 \sum_{k=0}^{s-1} k = s + 2 \cdot \frac{(s-1)s}{2} = s + s(s-1) = s^2
     \]
     Therefore, the sum of the third sequence is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \cdot s^2 = \frac{s^2}{2}
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for the sums:**
   - According to the problem, the sum of the first sequence is equal to the sum of the second sequence:
     \[
     \frac{9s^2(s+1)}{2} = \frac{9t^2(t+1)}{2}
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     s^2(s+1) = t^2(t+1)
     \]

   - The sum of the third sequence is given by:
     \[
     \frac{s^2}{2} + 2s + 2t + 2t^2 = 200
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \frac{s^2}{2} + 2s + 2t + 2t^2 = 200
     \]
     Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     s^2 + 4s + 4t + 4t^2 = 400
     \]

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - From \( s^2(s+1) = t^2(t+1) \), we can express \( t \) in terms of \( s \):
     \[
     t^2(t+1) = s^2(s+1)
     \]
     Taking the square root of both sides:
     \[
     t(t+1) = s(s+1)
     \]
     This implies:
     \[
     t = s
     \]

   - Substitute \( t = s \) into the second equation:
     \[
     s^2 + 4s + 4s + 4s^2 = 400
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     5s^2 + 8s = 400
     \]
     Dividing through by 5:
     \[
     s^2 + \frac{8}{5}s = 80
     \]
     Multiplying through by 5 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     5s^2 + 8s = 400
     \]
     Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
     \[
     s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 800}}{10} = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{864}}{10} = \frac{-8 \pm 24}{10}
     \]
     This gives us two solutions:
     \[
     s = \frac{16}{10} = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{-32}{10} = -3.2
     \]
     Since \( s \) must be a positive integer, we have:
     \[
     s = 2
     \]

5. **Find \( t \):**
   - Since \( t = s \), we have:
     \[
     t = 2
     \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{ s = 2 } \) and \( t = 2 \).","[{Eq(s, 2), Eq(t, 2)}, 's = 2 and t = 2']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"Given the triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we need to find the length of \(AP\) where \(P\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the line \(BC\) extended, and \(D\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(\triangle ABC\).

First, we calculate the area of \(\triangle ABC\) using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]
The area \(K\) of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]
The circumradius \(R\) of \(\triangle ABC\) is given by:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]
The length of the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\) is:
\[
h_a = \frac{2K}{BC} = \frac{2 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{12\sqrt{14}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]
Since \(D\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the circumcircle \(\omega\), \(AD\) is the diameter of the circumcircle, so \(AD = 2R = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{28}\).

The length of \(AP\) is the same as the length of the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\) because \(P\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the line \(BC\) extended, and \(D\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(A\) to the circumcircle. Therefore, the length of \(AP\) is:
\[
AP = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}
\]
The fraction \(\frac{4\sqrt{14}}{3}\) is already in its simplest form, so \(m = 4\sqrt{14}\) and \(n = 3\). However, since we are asked for the sum \(m + n\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers, we need to consider the rational part of the expression. The correct interpretation here is that the problem is asking for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the simplified fraction, which is:
\[
m + n = 4 + 3 = 7
\]
Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( m+n \) where \( \frac{m}{n} \) is the simplest form of the fraction representing the shaded area in a square divided into smaller squares.

1. **Identify the total number of small squares:**
   The large square is divided into \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) smaller squares.

2. **Count the number of shaded small squares:**
   By examining the diagram, we see that there are 10 shaded small squares.

3. **Form the fraction:**
   The fraction of the shaded area is \( \frac{10}{16} \).

"Given that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( p^2 \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \), we need to show that \( p^2 \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \).

First, let's analyze the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[ n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1). \]
However, since we are dealing with integers, we need to consider the properties of \( p \) and \( n \) modulo \( p \). If \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), then \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

Now, let's consider the expression \( m^4 + 1 \). Similarly, we can factorize it as:
\[ m^4 + 1 = (m^2 + \sqrt{2}m + 1)(m^2 - \sqrt{2}m + 1). \]
Again, we need to consider the properties of \( p \) and \( m \) modulo \( p \). If \( p^2 \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \), then \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \).

Since \( p^2 \) divides both \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \), it follows that \( p^2 \) must divide any linear combination of these expressions. In particular, \( p^2 \) must divide the difference between \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \), which is \( n^4 - m^4 \). This can be factored as:
\[ n^4 - m^4 = (n^2 + m^2)(n^2 - m^2) = (n^2 + m^2)(n + m)(n - m). \]
Since \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \), it must also divide \( n^4 - m^4 \). Therefore, \( p^2 \) must divide \( n^2 + m^2 \), \( n + m \), or \( n - m \).

However, since \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \), it follows that \( p^2 \) must divide \( m^4 + 1 \). This is because if \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), then \( p^2 \) must also divide any expression that is congruent to \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo \( p^2 \), including \( m^4 + 1 \).

Thus, the answer is:

"Given the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the length of the inradius \(r\) of the quadrilateral and express it in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\).

First, we recognize that \(ABCD\) is a kite because \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = AD\). The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular and the diagonal \(AC\) bisects the diagonal \(BD\). Let's denote the intersection of the diagonals as \(O\). Since \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the diagonals.

Let \(AO = x\) and \(BO = y\). Then, in \(\triangle AOB\), we have:
\[AB^2 = AO^2 + BO^2 \implies (\sqrt{41})^2 = x^2 + y^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 41.\]
In \(\triangle AOC\), we have:
\[AC^2 = AO^2 + CO^2 \implies (\sqrt{80})^2 = x^2 + (2y)^2 \implies x^2 + 4y^2 = 80.\]
We now have the system of equations:
\[x^2 + y^2 = 41,\]
\[x^2 + 4y^2 = 80.\]
Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[3y^2 = 39 \implies y^2 = 13 \implies y = \sqrt{13}.\]
Substitute \(y^2 = 13\) back into the first equation:
\[x^2 + 13 = 41 \implies x^2 = 28 \implies x = \sqrt{28} = 2\sqrt{7}.\]
So, the diagonals are \(AC = 2x = 4\sqrt{7}\) and \(BD = 2y = 2\sqrt{13}\).

The area \(K\) of the kite can be calculated using the formula for the area of a kite:
\[K = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\sqrt{7} \times 2\sqrt{13} = 4\sqrt{91}.\]
The semiperimeter \(s\) of the kite is:
\[s = \frac{AB + BC + CD + DA}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}}{2} = \sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}.\]
The inradius \(r\) of the kite is given by:
\[r = \frac{K}{s} = \frac{4\sqrt{91}}{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89}}.\]
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[r = \frac{4\sqrt{91}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{(\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89})(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})} = \frac{4\sqrt{91}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{89 - 41} = \frac{4\sqrt{91}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{48} = \frac{\sqrt{91}(\sqrt{89} - \sqrt{41})}{12}.\]
Thus, the inradius \(r\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{91} \cdot \sqrt{89} - \sqrt{91} \cdot \sqrt{41}}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{8099} - \sqrt{3731}}{12}\).

The values of \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are 1, 8099, and 12 respectively. Therefore, \(m + n + p = 1 + 8099 + 12 = 8112\).

The problem states that these two binomial coefficients are equal:

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the value of \(xy\).

First, let's simplify the given logarithmic equations.

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
   Using the logarithm power rule \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we get:
   \[
   x \log_x(y) = 10
   \]
   Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \implies x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \implies \log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
   \]

2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)
   Using the logarithm power rule again, we get:
   \[
   4y \log_y(x) = 10
   \]
   Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10 \implies 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \implies \log(y) = \frac{4y \log(x)}{10} = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
   \]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log(y)\):
\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log(y) = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\log(y)\), we get:
\[
\frac{10 \log(x)}{x} = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
\]
Assuming \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can cancel \(\log(x)\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"Given the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the number of ways to choose \( n \) items from 4 items (i.e., the number of subsets of a 4-element set) is equal to 2024. The number of ways to choose \( n \) items from 4 items is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{4}{n} \).

The binomial coefficient \( \binom{4}{n} \) is defined as:
\[
\binom{4}{n} = \frac{4!}{n!(4-n)!}
\]
We need to find \( n \) such that \( \binom{4}{n} = 2024 \). However, the maximum value of \( \binom{4}{n} \) is \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \), which is much less than 2024. This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem, as the binomial coefficient for a 4-element set can only take values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 4, 1, 0, and 1, and none of these are equal to 2024.

Given the problem's context and the fact that the number 2024 does not appear as a binomial coefficient for a 4-element set, it seems there might be a different interpretation or a different problem setup. However, based on the standard binomial coefficients for a 4-element set, the closest value to 2024 is 6, which is \( \binom{4}{2} \).

Since the problem asks for the value of \( n \) and the only feasible interpretation within the standard binomial coefficients for a 4-element set is that there is no such \( n \) that satisfies the equation \( \binom{4}{n} = 2024 \), the problem might need re-evaluation or rephrasing. But if we strictly follow the problem's setup and the standard binomial coefficients, the answer would be that there is no such \( n \).

"Given the problem, we need to find the length of \( CE \) in the quadrilateral \( ABCD \) with the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given lengths and properties:**
   - \( BC = 16 \)
   - \( AB = 107 \)
   - \( FG = 17 \)
   - \( EF = 184 \)
   - \( A, D, H, G \) are concyclic.
   - \( D, E, C, F \) are concyclic.
   - \( A, B, H, G \) are concyclic.

2. **Use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:**
   Since \( A, D, H, G \) are concyclic, the opposite angles sum to \( 180^\circ \). Similarly, since \( D, E, C, F \) are concyclic, the opposite angles sum to \( 180^\circ \). And since \( A, B, H, G \) are concyclic, the opposite angles sum to \( 180^\circ \).

3. **Use the Power of a Point theorem:**
   Since \( D, E, C, F \) are concyclic, we can use the Power of a Point theorem. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \( P \) outside a circle, the power of the point is the same for any two intersecting chords through \( P \). Here, \( E \) is the intersection of the chords \( AC \) and \( DF \).

4. **Calculate \( CE \):**
   Since \( D, E, C, F \) are concyclic, we can use the fact that the power of point \( E \) with respect to the circle is the same for both chords \( AC \) and \( DF \). This gives us the equation:

2. **Analyze the problem:**
   - The problem is a classic example of a combinatorial problem known as the ""rook polynomial"" or ""permanental problem"" in combinatorics.

   - This specific problem is related to the number of 8-by-8 binary matrices with exactly 4 ones in each row and each column, which is given by the formula for the number of 0-1 matrices with constant row and column sums.

4. **Calculate the number of ways:**
   - The number of such matrices is given by the formula for the number of 0-1 matrices with constant row and column sums, which is a special case of the problem of counting the number of balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD).

"Given that \( |z| = 4 \), we need to find the value of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\).

First, let's denote \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) since \( |z| = 4 \). This means \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, substitute \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) into the expression:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}

\]
\[

\]

Next, we use the fact that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)

\[

= 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta + i(336\cos\theta + 336\sin\theta)

Notice that the expression is purely real because the imaginary part cancels out. To find the value, we can use the fact that the expression is a constant for any \( \theta \) because the magnitudes and the coefficients are fixed. We can choose \( \theta = 0 \) for simplicity:

\[
3x + 4x + 5x = 180^\circ \implies 12x = 180^\circ \implies x = 15^\circ.
\]
Thus, the angles of the triangle are \(3x = 45^\circ\), \(4x = 60^\circ\), and \(5x = 75^\circ\).

Next, we are given that the circumradius \(R\) of the triangle is 14. Using the circumradius formula for a triangle, we have:
\[
R = \frac{a}{2 \sin A} = \frac{b}{2 \sin B} = \frac{c}{2 \sin C}.

For angle \(A = 45^\circ\), we have:

R = \frac{a}{2 \sin 45^\circ} = \frac{a}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} = 14 \implies a = 14\sqrt{2}.

Now, we need to find the area of the triangle. Using the formula for the area of a triangle with circumradius \(R\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{14\sqrt{2} \cdot 14\sqrt{3} \cdot 7(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{4 \cdot 14} = \frac{14^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot 7(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{4 \cdot 14} = \frac{14 \cdot \sqrt{6} \cdot 7(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{4} = \frac{98 \sqrt{6} (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{4} = \frac{49 \sqrt{6} (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{2} = \frac{49 (6 + \sqrt{12})}{2} = \frac{49 (6 + 2\sqrt{3})}{2} = 147 + 49\sqrt{3}.

The area of the triangle is \(147 + 49\sqrt{3}\). The ratio of the area to the circumradius is:

\]
Thus, the ratio is \(\frac{21 + 7\sqrt{3}}{2}\), and \(m = 21 + 7\sqrt{3}\) and \(n = 2\). Therefore, \(m + n = 21 + 7\sqrt{3} + 2 = 23 + 7\sqrt{3}\). However, since we are asked for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the simplified fraction, we have:

"Given that in \(\triangle ABC\), the incenter is \(I\) and the circumcenter is \(O\), and it is given that \(IA \perp OI\) and the circumradius \(R = 13\) and the inradius \(r = 6\), we need to find the product \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall that in any triangle, the distance \(OI\) between the incenter \(I\) and the circumcenter \(O\) is given by the formula:
\[ OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \]
where \(R\) is the circumradius and \(r\) is the inradius. Plugging in the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we get:
\[ OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13 \]
Thus, \(OI = \sqrt{13}\).

Since \(IA \perp OI\), the triangle \(IAO\) is a right triangle with \(IA\) as the altitude from \(I\) to \(O\). The length of \(IA\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle IAO\):
\[IA^2 = OI^2 + AO^2\]
where \(AO = R = 13\). Therefore,
\[IA^2 = 13 + 13 = 26 \]
So, \(IA = \sqrt{26}\).

Now, we use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed in two ways. First, using the circumradius and the sides of the triangle, the area \(K\) is given by:
\[ K = \frac{abc}{4R} \]
where \(a = BC\), \(b = CA\), and \(c = AB\). Second, using the inradius and the semiperimeter \(s\), the area is also given by:
\[ K = r \cdot s \]
where \(s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}\).

We also know that the area can be expressed in terms of the sides and the circumradius as:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h_A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot \sqrt{26} \]
where \(h_A\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\). Since \(h_A = \sqrt{26}\), we have:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot \sqrt{26} \]

Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[ \frac{abc}{4R} = r \cdot s \]
\[ \frac{abc}{4 \cdot 13} = 6 \cdot s \]
\[ \frac{abc}{52} = 6s \]
\[ abc = 312s \]

Since \(s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}\), we can substitute \(s\) in the equation:
\[ abc = 312 \cdot \frac{a+b+c}{2} \]
\[ abc = 156(a+b+c) \]

We also know that the product \(AB \cdot AC = bc\) can be found using the relationship between the sides and the circumradius. From the identity \(abc = 4R \cdot K\), we have:
\[ abc = 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6s = 312s \]
Since \(s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}\), we can substitute back to find \(abc\):
\[ abc = 312 \cdot \frac{a+b+c}{2} = 156(a+b+c) \]

Thus, the product \(AB \cdot AC = bc\) is:
\[ bc = 156 \]

Therefore, the product \(AB \cdot AC\) is:

"Given the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we need to find the value of \(abc\).

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We know from the problem statement that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]
So, we can substitute this into the equation:
\[6,000,000 = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Dividing the entire equation by 3, we get:
\[2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]
To find \(abc\), we need to determine the value of \(ab + bc + ca\). However, we can use the fact that the equation must hold true for some values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy \(a + b + c = 300\). Let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then:
\[a + a + a = 300 \implies 3a = 300 \implies a = 100.\]
So, if \(a = b = c = 100\), then:
\[ab + bc + ca = 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 = 30,000.\]
Substituting \(ab + bc + ca = 30,000\) into the equation for \(abc\), we get:
\[abc = 100 \cdot 30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.\]

"Given the expression \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we need to evaluate this product. Let's start by understanding the properties of \(\omega\).

Since \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). Also, the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero, i.e., \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \cdots + \omega^{12} = 0\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity because \((\omega^2)^{13} = \omega^{26} = (\omega^{13})^2 = 1^2 = 1\). Therefore, \(\omega^{2k}\) is just another 13th root of unity.

Let's rewrite the product in a more convenient form:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2(1-\omega^k) + \omega^{2k}).
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). The polynomial can be factored as:
\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2)\cdots(x-\omega^{12}).
\]

If we substitute \(x = 2\) into the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\), we get:
\[
2^{13} - 1 = (2-1)(2-\omega)(2-\omega^2)\cdots(2-\omega^{12}).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8191 = (2-1)(2-\omega)(2-\omega^2)\cdots(2-\omega^{12}).
\]
Since \(2-1 = 1\), we have:
\[
8191 = (2-\omega)(2-\omega^2)\cdots(2-\omega^{12}).
\]

Now, let's consider the expression \(2-2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Notice that if we substitute \(\omega^k\) with \(\omega^{2k}\), we get:
\[
2-2\omega^{2k} + \omega^{4k}.
\]
However, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). To do this, we can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) evaluated at \(x = 2\) gives us the product of the terms \(2 - \omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\).

By symmetry and properties of roots of unity, we can see that the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is equal to the product of the terms \(2 - \omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\) evaluated at \(x = 2\), which is \(8191\).

Therefore, the value of the product is:

"1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the smallest \( b \geq 2 \) such that the number \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant, where \( n \) is a number with digits \( a \) and \( b \) in base \( b \).
   - A number \( n \) is \( b \)-elegant if \( n = a^2 + b^2 \) and \( a + b = \sqrt{n} \).

2. **Expressing \( n \) in Base \( b \):**
   - In base \( b \), the number \( n \) can be written as \( n = ab + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \).

3. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - We need \( n = a^2 + b^2 \) and \( a + b = \sqrt{n} \).
   - Substituting \( n = a^2 + b^2 \) into \( a + b = \sqrt{n} \), we get:
     \[
     a + b = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}

     (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2
     \]
   - Expanding the left-hand side, we have:

"1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a regular 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) inscribed in a circle.
   - We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen chord of the circle is longer than a side of the dodecagon.

2. **Identifying the Chords:**
   - A chord of the circle is longer than a side of the dodecagon if and only if the endpoints of the chord are separated by at least two vertices of the dodecagon.
   - This is because the side of the dodecagon subtends an angle of \(30^\circ\) at the center of the circle (since \(360^\circ / 12 = 30^\circ\)).

3. **Counting the Chords:**
   - For each vertex of the dodecagon, there are 9 other vertices that are separated by at least two vertices.
   - Therefore, for each vertex, there are 9 chords that are longer than a side of the dodecagon.
   - Since there are 12 vertices, the total number of such chords is \(12 \times 9 = 108\).

4. **Total Number of Chords:**
   - The total number of chords in a circle with 12 points is given by the combination formula \(\binom{12}{2}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 12.
   - \[
   \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
   \]

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen chord is longer than a side of the dodecagon is the ratio of the number of favorable chords to the total number of chords.
   - \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{108}{66} = \frac{18}{11}

"1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The sum of the digits of the number is 30.
   - The number of digits in the number is 9.
   - The number is divisible by 9.

2. **Use the divisibility rule for 9:**
   - A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
   - Given that the sum of the digits is 30, we need to check if 30 is divisible by 9.
   - \( 30 \div 9 = 3 \) remainder \( 3 \), so 30 is not divisible by 9.

3. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - Since the sum of the digits is 30, and the number is divisible by 9, we need to find a number whose digits sum to 30 and is divisible by 9.
   - The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. The closest multiple of 9 to 30 is 27 (since \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \)).

4. **Adjust the sum of the digits:**
   - We need to adjust the sum of the digits from 30 to 27.
   - This means we need to reduce the sum by \( 30 - 27 = 3 \).

5. **Determine the number of digits:**
   - The number of digits in the number is 9.

"1. **Identify the given numbers and their properties:**
   - We have the numbers \(0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 1\).
   - We need to arrange these numbers in a \(3 \times 3\) grid such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same.

2. **Calculate the magic constant:**
   - The magic constant \(M\) for a \(3 \times 3\) magic square is given by:
     \[

"Given the equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

We start by converting these logarithmic equations into exponential form:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply these three equations together:
\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right)}
\]

We need to find the sum of the exponents:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Equating the simplified left-hand side and right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:
\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

We need to find \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\):
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (xyz)^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}
\]

Substituting \(xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\):
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = \left(2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\right)^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2} = 2^{-\frac{52}{12}} \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2} = 2^{-\frac{13}{3}} \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2\left(2^{-\frac{13}{3}} \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}\right) = -\frac{13}{3} + \log_2(y^{-1}) + \log_2(z^{-2})
\]

Using the property \(\log_2(y^{-1}) = -\log_2(y)\) and \(\log_2(z^{-2}) = -2\log_2(z)\):
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{13}{3} - \log_2(y) - 2\log_2(z)
\]

We know from the original equations:
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \log_2(z) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(y) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding these three equations:
\[
(\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z)) + (\log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z)) + (\log_2(z) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
0 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the fact that:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

Using the properties of logarithms and the given equations, we find:
\[
4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) = 4 \left(\frac{1}{2} + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z)\right) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

Simplifying:
\[
4 \left(\frac{1}{2} + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z)\right) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) = 2 + 4 \log_2(y) + 4 \log_2(z) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)

First, let's identify the smallest and largest numbers between 1 and 1000 that are divisible by 7. The smallest number is 7 and the largest is 994. We can express \( N \) as \( 7k \) where \( k \) is an integer. The range for \( k \) is from 1 to 142 (since \( 7 \times 142 = 994 \)).

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( r_i - r_o \) and express it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers. We are then asked to find \(m + n\).

First, let's analyze the given information:
- \(T\) is a tangent to a circle with radius 3.
- \(S\) is a tangent to the same circle with radius 11.
- \(r_i\) is the radius of the circle that is tangent to both \(T\) and \(S\) externally.
- \(r_o\) is the radius of the circle that is tangent to both \(T\) and \(S\) internally.

We use the formula for the radii of the circles tangent to two given circles externally and internally. For two circles with radii \(R\) and \(r\) and a circle tangent to both externally and internally, the radii \(r_i\) and \(r_o\) are given by:
\[
r_i = \frac{Rr}{R - r}
\]
\[
r_o = \frac{Rr}{R + r}
\]

Here, \(R = 11\) and \(r = 3\). Plugging these values into the formulas, we get:
\[
r_i = \frac{11 \cdot 3}{11 - 3} = \frac{33}{8}
\]
\[
r_o = \frac{11 \cdot 3}{11 + 3} = \frac{33}{14}
\]

Next, we find the difference \(r_i - r_o\):
\[
r_i - r_o = \frac{33}{8} - \frac{33}{14}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 14 is 56. Converting the fractions:
\[
\frac{33}{8} = \frac{33 \cdot 7}{8 \cdot 7} = \frac{231}{56}
\]
\[
\frac{33}{14} = \frac{33 \cdot 4}{14 \cdot 4} = \frac{132}{56}

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[
r_i - r_o = \frac{231}{56} - \frac{132}{56} = \frac{231 - 132}{56} = \frac{99}{56}
\]

Thus, \(r_i - r_o = \frac{99}{56}\). Here, \(m = 99\) and \(n = 56\), and they are coprime. Therefore, \(m + n = 99 + 56 = 155\).
