"1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( s \) be the number of minutes per day for the first 4 hours.
   - Let \( t \) be the number of minutes per day for the next 2 hours.
   - Let \( t' \) be the number of minutes per day for the last 2 hours.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - For the first 4 hours: \( 4s \)
   - For the next 2 hours: \( 2t \)
   - For the last 2 hours: \( 2t' \)

3. **Sum the total minutes for the entire day:**
   \[
   4s + 2t + 2t' = 1440
   \]

4. **Express \( t' \) in terms of \( s \) and \( t \):**
   \[
   t' = \frac{1440 - 4s - 2t}{2}
   \]

5. **Given that \( t' = s + \frac{1}{2} \):**
   \[
   s + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1440 - 4s - 2t}{2}
   \]

6. **Solve for \( s \) and \( t \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     2s + 1 = 1440 - 4s - 2t
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6s + 2t = 1439
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     3s + t = 719.5
     \]

7. **Express \( t \) in terms of \( s \):**
   \[
   t = 719.5 - 3s
   \]

8. **Substitute \( t \) back into the total minutes equation:**
   \[
   4s + 2(719.5 - 3s) + 2t' = 1440
   \]
   \[
   4s + 1439 - 6s + 2t' = 1440
   \]
   \[
   -2s + 1439 + 2t' = 1440
   \]
   \[
   2t' = 2s + 1
   \]
   \[
   t' = s + \frac{1}{2}
   \]

9. **Verify the solution:**
   - Substitute \( t' = s + \frac{1}{2} \) back into the equation:
     \[
     4s + 2t + 2(s + \frac{1}{2}) = 1440
     \]
     \[
     4s + 2t + 2s + 1 = 1440
     \]
     \[
     6s + 2t + 1 = 1440
     \]
     \[
     6s + 2t = 1439
     \]
     \[
     3s + t = 719.5
     \]

10. **Conclusion:**
    - The values of \( s \) and \( t \) satisfy the given conditions.
    - Therefore, the number of minutes per day for the first 4 hours is \( s \), for the next 2 hours is \( t \), and for the last 2 hours is \( t' = s + \frac{1}{2} \).

"Given triangle \(ABC\) with circumcircle \(\omega\), point \(D\) on the circumcircle such that \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\), and point \(P\) on \(AD\) such that \(AP = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, we need to find \(m+n\).

First, we use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) divides the opposite side \(BC\) into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
This means that \(BD = \frac{1}{3}BC = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\) and \(DC = \frac{2}{3}BC = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\).

Next, we use the fact that \(AD\) is the angle bisector and \(P\) is a point on \(AD\) such that \(AP = \frac{m}{n}\). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the length of the angle bisector \(AD\) can be found using the formula:
\[
AD^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
AD^2 = 5 \cdot 10 \left(1 - \frac{9^2}{(5 + 10)^2}\right) = 50 \left(1 - \frac{81}{225}\right) = 50 \left(\frac{225 - 81}{225}\right) = 50 \left(\frac{144}{225}\right) = 50 \left(\frac{16}{25}\right) = 32
\]
Thus, \(AD = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\).

Since \(P\) is a point on \(AD\) and \(AP = \frac{m}{n}\), we need to find the ratio of \(AP\) to \(AD\). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of \(AP\) to \(PD\) is the same as the ratio of \(AB\) to \(AC\), which is \(1:2\). Therefore, \(AP = \frac{1}{3}AD = \frac{1}{3} \times 4\sqrt{2} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

Thus, \(m = 4\) and \(n = 3\), and \(m+n = 4+3 = 7\).

"1. **Define the problem and variables:**
   Let \( m \) and \( n \) be the numerator and denominator of the fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) respectively, where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers (i.e., \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\)).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   According to the problem, the fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) is equal to the sum of its digits. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{m}{n} = \text{sum of the digits of } m
   \]

3. **Express the sum of the digits of \( m \):**
   Let \( m \) be a \( k \)-digit number. The sum of the digits of \( m \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{sum of the digits of } m = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
   \]
   where \( d_i \) are the digits of \( m \).

4. **Relate the sum of the digits to the fraction:**
   Since \(\frac{m}{n}\) is a fraction, we can write:
   \[
   m = n \times \text{sum of the digits of } m
   \]
   Substituting the sum of the digits, we get:
   \[
   m = n \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
   \]

5. **Analyze the possible values of \( n \):**
   Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, \( n \) must be a divisor of \( m \). The possible values of \( n \) are the divisors of \( m \) that are less than \( m \).

6. **Check the possible values of \( n \):**
   We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( m = n \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i \) and \( m \) is a \( k \)-digit number. Let's start with small values of \( n \).

   - For \( n = 1 \):
     \[
     m = 1 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
     \]
     This is not possible since \( m \) must be a \( k \)-digit number.

   - For \( n = 2 \):

   - For \( n = 3 \):
     \[
     m = 3 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i

   - For \( n = 4 \):
     \[
     m = 4 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
     \]
     This is not possible since \( m \) must be a \( k \)-digit number.

   - For \( n = 5 \):
     \[
     m = 5 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
     \]
     This is not possible since \( m \) must be a \( k \)-digit number.

   - For \( n = 6 \):
     \[
     m = 6 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
     \]
     This is not possible since \( m \) must be a \( k \)-digit number.

   - For \( n = 7 \):
     \[
     m = 7 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
     \]
     This is not possible since \( m \) must be a \( k \)-digit number.

   - For \( n = 8 \):
     \[
     m = 8 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
     \]
     This is not possible since \( m \) must be a \( k \)-digit number.

   - For \( n = 9 \):
     \[
     m = 9 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_i
     \]
     This is not possible since \( m \) must be a \( k \)-digit number.

7. **Conclusion:**
   The smallest possible value of \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions is \( n = 9 \). Therefore, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is:
   \[
   m + n = 9 + 1 = 10

"Given that \( p^2 \) divides both \( n^4 + 1 \) and \( m^4 + 1 \), we need to determine the nature of \( p \) and the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \).

First, let's analyze the condition that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). This means that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Squaring both sides, we get \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \). This tells us that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8. The possible orders are 1, 2, 4, or 8. However, since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the order cannot be 1, 2, or 4 (because \( n^4 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \)). Therefore, the order must be 8.

Next, let's consider the condition that \( p^2 \) divides \( m^4 + 1 \). This means that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). Squaring both sides, we get \( m^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \). Again, the order of \( m \) modulo \( p^2 \) must be a divisor of 8, and it cannot be 1, 2, or 4. Therefore, the order must also be 8.

Since both \( n \) and \( m \) have the same order modulo \( p^2 \), it follows that \( n \) and \( m \) are congruent modulo \( p^2 \). This means that \( n \equiv m \pmod{p^2} \).

Thus, the nature of \( p \) is that it must be a prime number, and the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \) is that they are congruent modulo \( p^2 \). Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the length of the diagonal \(I\) of the quadrilateral, which is the perpendicular bisector of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

First, we note that \(ABCD\) is a kite because \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = AD\). The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular and the diagonal \(AC\) bisects the diagonal \(BD\) at right angles. Let's denote the intersection point of the diagonals as \(O\). Since \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the diagonals.

Let \(AO = OC = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{80}}{2} = \sqrt{20}\) and \(BO = OD = \frac{BD}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{80}}{2} = \sqrt{20}\). Now, consider the right triangle \(ABO\). We have:
\[AB^2 = AO^2 + BO^2\]
\[(\sqrt{41})^2 = (\sqrt{20})^2 + BO^2\]
\[41 = 20 + BO^2\]
\[BO^2 = 21\]
\[BO = \sqrt{21}\]

Now, we need to find the length of the diagonal \(I\), which is the perpendicular bisector of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). Since \(I\) is the perpendicular bisector, it forms right triangles with the segments of the diagonals. Let's consider the right triangle formed by \(I\), \(AO\), and the half of the diagonal \(BD\). The length of \(I\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by \(I\), \(AO\), and the half of the diagonal \(BD\).

The length of \(I\) is the same as the length of the perpendicular bisector of the diagonals of the kite, which is the same as the length of the diagonal \(BD\) divided by 2. Therefore, the length of \(I\) is:
\[I = \sqrt{(\sqrt{41})^2 - (\sqrt{20})^2} = \sqrt{41 - 20} = \sqrt{21}\]

The length of the diagonal \(I\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{80}}{2} = \sqrt{20}\).

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( r^2 \) in the form of \(\frac{p}{q}\) and then find \( p + q \).

First, let's recall the quadratic formula for the roots of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \):
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

The sum and product of the roots of the quadratic equation are given by:
\[ \text{Sum of the roots} = -\frac{b}{a} \]
\[ \text{Product of the roots} = \frac{c}{a} \]

Given:
- The sum of the roots is 54.
- The product of the roots is 23.

Using these, we can write:
\[ -\frac{b}{a} = 54 \]
\[ \frac{c}{a} = 23 \]

From the sum of the roots, we get:
\[ b = -54a \]

From the product of the roots, we get:
\[ c = 23a \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( r^2 \). The value of \( r \) is the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is given by:
\[ r = \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \]

Substituting \( b = -54a \) and \( c = 23a \) into the discriminant formula, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{(-54a)^2 - 4a(23a)} \]
\[ r = \sqrt{2916a^2 - 92a^2} \]
\[ r = \sqrt{2824a^2} \]
\[ r = \sqrt{2824} \cdot a \]

Since \( r \) is the discriminant, we need to find \( r^2 \):
\[ r^2 = (\sqrt{2824} \cdot a)^2 \]
\[ r^2 = 2824a^2 \]

Since \( a \) is a non-zero constant, we can simplify \( r^2 \) to:
\[ r^2 = 2824 \]

Thus, \( r^2 \) is in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \( p = 2824 \) and \( q = 1 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 2824 + 1 = 2825 \).

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the value of \(xy\).

First, let's simplify the given logarithmic equations.

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
   Using the logarithm power rule \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we get:
   \[
   x \log_x(y) = 10
   \]
   Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   x \cdot \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x \log(y) = 10 \log(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x}
   \]

2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)
   Using the logarithm power rule again, we get:
   \[
   4y \log_y(x) = 10
   \]
   Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   4y \cdot \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log(y) = \frac{4y \log(x)}{10} = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
   \]

Now we have two expressions for \(\log(y)\):
\[
\log(y) = \frac{10 \log(x)}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log(y) = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(\log(y)\), we get:
\[
\frac{10 \log(x)}{x} = \frac{2y \log(x)}{5}
\]
Assuming \(\log(x) \neq 0\), we can cancel \(\log(x)\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
50 = 2xy \quad \Rightarrow \quad xy = 25
\]

"Given the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the number of ways to choose 2024 elements from a set of \( n \) elements is exactly 1. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements. The binomial coefficient is defined as:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}

First, observe that since \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic, the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is cyclic. This means that the opposite angles of \(ABCD\) sum to \(180^\circ\).

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) and \(C\) are points on the line segment \(DF\). We need to find the length of \(CE\).

Given the lengths \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\), we can use the fact that \(E\) and \(C\) are collinear with \(D\) and \(F\) respectively. Since \(E\) and \(C\) are on the same line, we can use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the given lengths to find \(CE\).

"Given the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) and the condition \(|z| = 4\), we need to find the value of this expression.

First, let's denote \(z\) as \(z = re^{i\theta}\) where \(r = |z| = 4\). Therefore, \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) and \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Now, substitute \(z\) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) into the given expression:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]
\[
= 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]
\[
= 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Next, we use the property of complex conjugates. Recall that \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]
\[
= 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]
\[
= 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + i(36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta))

\[

\]
\[
= (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(336\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta)

Notice that the imaginary part of the expression is zero because the coefficients of \(i\) in the real and imaginary parts are conjugates of each other. Therefore, the expression simplifies to a real number:

324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta + i(336\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta) = 0 + 0i = 0

"Given that the lengths of the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\) are in the ratio \(3:4\), and the circumradius \(R\) of the triangle is 1, we need to find the ratio of the area of the triangle to the circumradius and then determine the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this ratio in its simplest form.

First, let's denote the sides \(AB = 3k\) and \(BC = 4k\). Let \(AC = c\). The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be expressed using the circumradius formula:
\[ K = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{3k \cdot 4k \cdot c}{4 \cdot 1} = 3k^2c. \]

We also know that the area of a triangle can be expressed using the sine of the included angle. Let \(\angle ABC = \theta\). Then,
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot BC \cdot \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3k \cdot 4k \cdot \sin \theta = 6k^2 \sin \theta. \]

Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[ 3k^2c = 6k^2 \sin \theta \implies c = 2 \sin \theta. \]

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle \(ABC\), we have:
\[ c^2 = (3k)^2 + (4k)^2 - 2 \cdot 3k \cdot 4k \cdot \cos \theta = 9k^2 + 16k^2 - 24k^2 \cos \theta = 25k^2 - 24k^2 \cos \theta. \]
Since \(c = 2 \sin \theta\), we substitute \(c\) into the equation:
\[ (2 \sin \theta)^2 = 25k^2 - 24k^2 \cos \theta \implies 4 \sin^2 \theta = 25k^2 - 24k^2 \cos \theta. \]
Using the identity \(\sin^2 \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta\), we get:
\[ 4(1 - \cos^2 \theta) = 25k^2 - 24k^2 \cos \theta \implies 4 - 4 \cos^2 \theta = 25k^2 - 24k^2 \cos \theta. \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ 4 \cos^2 \theta - 24k^2 \cos \theta + 25k^2 - 4 = 0. \]
This is a quadratic equation in \(\cos \theta\). Solving for \(\cos \theta\) using the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ \cos \theta = \frac{24k^2 \pm \sqrt{(24k^2)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (25k^2 - 4)}}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{24k^2 \pm \sqrt{576k^4 - 400k^2 + 64}}{8} = \frac{24k^2 \pm \sqrt{576k^4 - 400k^2 + 64}}{8}. \]
Since \(\cos \theta\) must be between -1 and 1, we can simplify the expression to find the correct value of \(\cos \theta\). However, we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is also given by:
\[ K = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{3k \cdot 4k \cdot 2 \sin \theta}{4 \cdot 1} = 6k^2 \sin \theta. \]

"Given the hyperbola equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the length of the diagonal \(BD^2\) of the rectangle \(ABCD\) inscribed in the hyperbola.

First, let's identify the vertices of the hyperbola. The standard form of a hyperbola is \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\), where \(a^2 = 20\) and \(b^2 = 24\). Therefore, \(a = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\) and \(b = \sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{6}\).

The vertices of the hyperbola are at \((\pm a, 0) = (\pm 2\sqrt{5}, 0)\) and \((0, \pm b) = (0, \pm 2\sqrt{6})\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle inscribed in the hyperbola, the vertices of the rectangle will be at \((\pm 2\sqrt{5}, \pm 2\sqrt{6})\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) of the rectangle is the distance between two opposite vertices, say \((2\sqrt{5}, 2\sqrt{6})\) and \((-2\sqrt{5}, -2\sqrt{6})\).

The distance \(BD\) is calculated as follows:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{5} - (-2\sqrt{5}))^2 + (2\sqrt{6} - (-2\sqrt{6}))^2} = \sqrt{(4\sqrt{5})^2 + (4\sqrt{6})^2} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 5 + 16 \cdot 6} = \sqrt{80 + 96} = \sqrt{176} = 4\sqrt{11}
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = (4\sqrt{11})^2 = 16 \cdot 11 = 176\).

Therefore, the value of \(BD^2\) is \(\boxed{176}\).","[176, '176']",480,"[480, '480']",False

"Given that \(O\) is the circumcenter and \(I\) is the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\), and that \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), with the circumradius \(R = 13\) and the inradius \(r = 6\), we need to find the product \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall that the distance \(OI\) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the triangle \(\triangle OIA\) is a right triangle with \(\angle OIA = 90^\circ\). The length of \(IA\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle OIA\):
\[
IA^2 = OA^2 - OI^2 = R^2 - OI^2 = 13^2 - 13 = 169 - 13 = 156
\]
Thus,
\[
IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \(IA\) is also equal to the distance from the incenter to the side \(BC\), which is the inradius \(r\) times the cosine of half the angle at \(A\). However, we can use the fact that the product \(AB \cdot AC\) can be found using the formula involving the circumradius and the inradius:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 4Rr
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we get:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 312

"Given the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we need to find the value of \(abc\).

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
We know from the problem statement that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]
So, we can substitute this into the equation:
\[6,000,000 = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\]
To find \(abc\), we need to determine the value of \(ab + bc + ca\). However, we can use the fact that the equation must hold true for some values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy \(a + b + c = 300\). Let's assume \(a = b = c\). Then:
\[a + a + a = 300 \implies 3a = 300 \implies a = 100.\]
So, if \(a = b = c = 100\), then:
\[ab + bc + ca = 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 + 100 \cdot 100 = 30,000.\]
Substituting \(ab + bc + ca = 30,000\) into the equation for \(abc\), we get:
\[abc = 100 \cdot 30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.\]

"Given the points \(O = (0,0)\), \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\), we need to find the value of \(OC^2\) where \(C\) is the point of intersection of the angle bisector of \(\angle AOB\) with the line segment \(AB\). We are also given that \(OC^2 = \frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and we need to find \(p+q\).

First, we find the equation of the angle bisector of \(\angle AOB\). The angle bisector of \(\angle AOB\) divides the angle into two equal parts. The coordinates of the point \(C\) can be found using the angle bisector theorem, which states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides.

The coordinates of \(C\) can be found using the section formula. The section formula for a point dividing a line segment joining \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in the ratio \(m:n\) is given by:
\[
\left( \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}, \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n} \right)
\]
Here, the ratio is determined by the lengths of the sides \(OA\) and \(OB\). The length of \(OA\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\) and the length of \(OB\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Therefore, the ratio is \(1:\sqrt{3}\).

Using the section formula, the coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[
C = \left( \frac{1 \cdot 0 + \sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{1 + \sqrt{3}}, \frac{1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \sqrt{3} \cdot 0}{1 + \sqrt{3}} \right) = \left( \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1 + \sqrt{3}}, \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{1 + \sqrt{3}} \right) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2(1 + \sqrt{3})}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2(1 + \sqrt{3})} \right)
\]
Rationalizing the denominator, we get:
\[
C = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}(1 - \sqrt{3})}{2(1 - 3)}, \frac{\sqrt{3}(1 - \sqrt{3})}{2(1 - 3)} \right) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3} - 3}{-4}, \frac{\sqrt{3} - 3}{-4} \right) = \left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4}, \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4} \right)
\]
Now, we need to find the distance \(OC\). The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(O\) and \(C\), we get:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4} - 0 \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4} - 0 \right)^2} = \sqrt{2 \left( \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{(3 - \sqrt{3})^2}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(9 - 6\sqrt{3} + 3)}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(12 - 6\sqrt{3})}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{24 - 12\sqrt{3}}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{6 - 3\sqrt{3}}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{6 - 3\sqrt{3}}}{2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
OC^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{6 - 3\sqrt{3}}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{6 - 3\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Thus, \(p = 6\) and \(q = 4\), and \(p + q = 10\).

"Given that \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, we know that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). We need to evaluate the product

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

First, observe that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) implies \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\). Therefore, the product can be rewritten as

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

We can factor out the 2 from the first term in each factor:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} 2 (1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2}).
\]

This can be simplified to

\[
2^{13} \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2}).
\]

Next, we need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2})\). Notice that \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). The polynomial can be factored as

\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{12}).
\]

We need to evaluate the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\) at \(x = 1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2})\) is related to the polynomial evaluated at specific points. By properties of roots of unity and symmetric functions, we can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial can be related to the resultant of the polynomials.

The polynomial \(1 - \omega^k + \frac{\omega^{2k}}{2}\) evaluated at the roots of unity will simplify due to the symmetry and properties of roots of unity. After detailed analysis or using known results from algebraic number theory, we find that the product evaluates to 1. Therefore, we have

\[
2^{13} \cdot 1 = 8192.
\]

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 8192 is divided by 1000. We perform the division:

\[
8192 \div 1000 = 8 \text{ remainder } 192.
\]

Thus, the remainder is 192. Therefore, the answer is

   - We need this to equal 81 in base 10:

2. **Solving for \( b \):**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[

\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Next, we multiply these three equations together:
\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{xyz}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right)}
\]

We need to find the sum of the exponents:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Equating the simplified left-hand side and right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:
\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

We need to find \(\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right|\):
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = (xyz)^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}
\]

Substituting \(xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\):
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = \left(2^{-\frac{13}{12}}\right)^4 \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2} = 2^{-\frac{52}{12}} \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2} = 2^{-\frac{13}{3}} \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2\left(2^{-\frac{13}{3}} \cdot y^{-1} \cdot z^{-2}\right) = -\frac{13}{3} + \log_2(y^{-1}) + \log_2(z^{-2})
\]

Using the property \(\log_2(y^{-1}) = -\log_2(y)\) and \(\log_2(z^{-2}) = -2\log_2(z)\):
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{13}{3} - \log_2(y) - 2\log_2(z)
\]

We need to find the absolute value:
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \left| -\frac{13}{3} - \log_2(y) - 2\log_2(z) \right|
\]

Since we don't have specific values for \(y\) and \(z\), we assume they are such that the expression inside the absolute value is positive. Therefore:
\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \frac{13}{3}
\]

Thus, \(m = 13\) and \(n = 3\), and:
\[
m + n = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Given that the sides of the hexagon are \(AB = 200\), \(CD = 240\), and \(EF = 300\), and the hexagon is equilateral, we need to find the perimeter of the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal in length. Therefore, each side of the hexagon is the same length as the given sides. However, the problem does not specify that all sides are equal, but it implies that the hexagon is equilateral based on the given information. This means that the hexagon has six equal sides.

To find the perimeter, we need to determine the length of one side. Since the hexagon is equilateral, we can use any of the given side lengths to find the perimeter. Let's use the side length \(AB = 200\) as an example. The perimeter \(P\) of a hexagon is given by the formula:

\[ P = 6 \times \text{side length} \]

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the side length is the same for all sides. Therefore, we can use any of the given side lengths to find the perimeter. Let's use the side length \(AB = 200\) as an example. The perimeter \(P\) of the hexagon is:

\[ P = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

"Given that \( N \) is a four-digit number and \( N \) is divisible by 7, we need to find the sum of the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000. We are also given that \( N \) is less than 1000, so \( N \) is a three-digit number. However, since \( N \) is a four-digit number, we need to find the smallest four-digit number divisible by 7, which is 1001.

We start by dividing 1001 by 7:
\[ 1001 \div 7 = 143 \]
This means that when 1001 is divided by 7, the quotient is 143 and the remainder is 0. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 1001 = 7 \times 143 + 0 \]
Here, \( Q = 143 \) and \( R = 0 \). The sum of the quotient and the remainder is:
\[ Q + R = 143 + 0 = 143 \]
