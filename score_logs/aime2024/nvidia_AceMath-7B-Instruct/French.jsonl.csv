"To determine the total time Aya takes for her promenade when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour, we first need to find the value of \( s \) and the time spent walking.

Given that Aya's total promenade time is 4 hours when she walks at \( s \) kilometers per hour, and 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours) when she walks at \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, we can set up the following equations based on the relationship between distance, speed, and time:

1. When walking at \( s \) km/h:
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = \frac{9}{s} \text{ hours}
   \]
   Total time including the break:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. When walking at \( s + 2 \) km/h:
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = \frac{9}{s+2} \text{ hours}
   \]
   Total time including the break:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \text{ hours}
   \]

We can eliminate \( \frac{t}{60} \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 4 - 2.4
\]
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{(s+2) - s}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s(s+2)
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s
\]
\[
1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0
\]
We can simplify this quadratic equation by dividing every term by 1.6:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, we have:
\[
s = 2.5 \text{ km/h}
\]

Now, we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the equation for the total time including the break to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4
\]
\[
t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time Aya takes for her promenade when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h:
\[
\text{Time walking} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total time including the break} = 3 + \frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \text{ hours}
\]
Converting 3.4 hours to minutes:
\[
3.4 \times 60 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the number of minutes that the promenade takes, including the \( t \) minutes passed in the caf√©, is:

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in the circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of the tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that the tangents to a circle from a point outside the circle are equal in length. Therefore, \(DB = DC\).

Next, we use the power of a point theorem, which states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the power of the point with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of any secant line passing through the point. In this case, the secant line is \(AD\), and it intersects the circle at points \(A\) and \(P\). The power of point \(D\) is also equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to the circle, which is \(DB^2\).

Thus, we have:
\[
DB^2 = AD \cdot AP
\]

To find \(DB\), we use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). The length of the tangent from a point to a circle can be found using the formula:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC}
\]

Substituting the given side lengths \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we get:
\[
DB = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Now, we substitute \(DB^2\) into the power of a point theorem:
\[
(5\sqrt{2})^2 = AD \cdot AP
\]
\[
50 = AD \cdot AP
\]

Next, we need to find \(AD\). We use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), and the formula for the length of the tangent segment from a point to a circle in terms of the sides of the triangle. The length of the tangent segment from the point of intersection of the tangents to the circle is given by:
\[
AD = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{BC}
\]

Substituting the given side lengths, we get:
\[
AD = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{9} = \frac{50}{9}
\]

Now, we substitute \(AD\) back into the power of a point theorem:
\[
50 = \frac{50}{9} \cdot AP
\]

To solve for \(AP\), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{50}{9}\):
\[
AP = 50 \cdot \frac{9}{50} = 9
\]

Thus, \(AP\) can be written as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 9\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 9 + 1 = 10\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon with vertices colored either red or blue can be rotated such that all blue vertices originally occupied positions where there were red vertices.

First, let's consider the total number of possible colorings of the octagon. Since each vertex can be either red or blue, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of colorings for which the octagon can be rotated to a position where all blue vertices are in positions originally occupied by red vertices. This means that the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, and they must be in positions that are symmetric with respect to the rotation.

An octagon has 8 vertices, so the only way to have all blue vertices in positions originally occupied by red vertices after a rotation is if there are exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices. The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of 8 to be blue is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\):
\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70
\]

However, not all of these colorings will satisfy the condition that the octagon can be rotated to a position where all blue vertices are in positions originally occupied by red vertices. We need to consider the rotational symmetry of the octagon. An octagon can be rotated by 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, or 315 degrees, and we need to find colorings that are invariant under some of these rotations.

A coloring that is invariant under a 90-degree rotation must have the same color pattern in each of the four quadrants of the octagon. Therefore, there are only 2 possible colorings for each quadrant (all red or all blue), and since there are four quadrants, there are \(2^4 = 16\) such colorings.

A coloring that is invariant under a 180-degree rotation must have the same color pattern in each of the two pairs of opposite vertices. Therefore, there are \(2^4 = 16\) such colorings.

A coloring that is invariant under a 270-degree rotation is the same as a coloring invariant under a 90-degree rotation, so there are 16 such colorings.

A coloring that is invariant under a 360-degree rotation (i.e., no rotation) is any coloring, so there are 70 such colorings.

To find the number of colorings that can be rotated to a position where all blue vertices are in positions originally occupied by red vertices, we need to consider the colorings that are invariant under a 180-degree rotation. These colorings are the only ones that can be rotated to a position where all blue vertices are in positions originally occupied by red vertices.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is 16. The probability that an octagon can be rotated to a position where all blue vertices are in positions originally occupied by red vertices is:
\[
\frac{16}{256} = \frac{1}{16}
\]

Thus, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 16\), and \(m + n = 1 + 16 = 17\).

"To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will be 0 at \( x = \frac{k}{2} \) for integers \( k \) and will be 1 at \( x = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{k}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{k}{2} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\left| \left| \frac{1}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{1}{4}\). Specifically, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will be 0 at \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and will be \(\frac{1}{4}\) at \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1. It will be 0 at \( x = \frac{k}{2} \) and at \( x = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{k}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{k}{2} \) for integers \( k \), and it will be 1 at \( x = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{k}{2} \), \( x = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{k}{2} \), \( x = \frac{5}{8} + \frac{k}{2} \), and \( x = \frac{7}{8} + \frac{k}{2} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Similarly, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1. It will be 0 at \( y = \frac{k}{3} \) and at \( y = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{k}{3} \) and \( y = \frac{5}{6} + \frac{k}{3} \) for integers \( k \), and it will be 1 at \( y = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{k}{3} \), \( y = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{k}{3} \), \( y = \frac{5}{12} + \frac{k}{3} \), \( y = \frac{7}{12} + \frac{k}{3} \), \( y = \frac{9}{12} + \frac{k}{3} \), and \( y = \frac{11}{12} + \frac{k}{3} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 7: Find the number of intersections
The graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will intersect at points where both functions are equal. Since both functions are periodic and symmetric, we can consider the interval \([0, 1]\) for both \( x \) and \( y \).

In the interval \([0, 1]\), the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) has 4 points where it is 1 and 6 points where it is 0. The function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) has 6 points where it is 1 and 4 points where it is 0. Each point where \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) is 1 will intersect each point where \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) is 1, giving \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) intersections.

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs is \(\boxed{24}\).","[24, '24']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or their product must be divisible by \( p^2 \). This implies that \( p \) must be a prime that can be written in the form \( 8k + 1 \) or \( 8k + 3 \) or \( 8k + 5 \) or \( 8k + 7 \) (since \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \) has solutions if and only if \( p \equiv 1, 3, 5, 7 \pmod{8} \)).

The smallest prime number that satisfies this condition is \( p = 17 \). We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \).

Let's test \( n = 8 \):
\[
8^4 + 1 = 4096 + 1 = 4097.
\]
Since \( 4097 = 17 \times 241 \), \( 4097 \) is divisible by \( 17 \) but not by \( 289 \), \( n = 8 \) is not a solution.

"To find the distance from the point \( I \) inside the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) to each of its faces, we need to use the fact that \( I \) is the incenter of the tetrahedron. The incenter is the point where the four internal angle bisectors of the tetrahedron meet, and it is equidistant from all four faces.

First, we need to calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \). We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant for this purpose. The determinant is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\
1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\
1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\
1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( AB = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = \sqrt{80} \), \( AD = \sqrt{89} \), \( BC = \sqrt{89} \), \( BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( CD = \sqrt{41} \), we get:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating the determinant, we get:

\[
288 V^2 = -288000
\]

Thus,

\[
V^2 = 1000 \quad \Rightarrow \quad V = \sqrt{1000} = 10\sqrt{10}
\]

Next, we need to find the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of each face. Let's start with face \( ABC \):

The semi-perimeter \( s \) of triangle \( ABC \) is:

\[
s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

The area \( K \) of triangle \( ABC \) is:

\[
K = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)}
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the tetrahedron is isosceles, and the areas of the faces can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle given its sides. After calculating the areas of all four faces, we find that the total surface area \( S \) is:

\[
S = 4 \times 10 = 40
\]

The distance \( d \) from the incenter \( I \) to each face is given by:

\[
d = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times 10\sqrt{10}}{40} = \frac{3\sqrt{10}}{4}
\]

Thus, \( m = 3 \), \( n = 10 \), and \( p = 4 \), and the sum \( m + n + p \) is:

\[
m + n + p = 3 + 10 + 4 = 17

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangular box as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). We are given two conditions: the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. These can be written as:
\[ab + bc + ca = 54\]
\[abc = 23\]

Since 23 is a prime number, one of the dimensions must be 23. Without loss of generality, let \(c = 23\). Then the equations become:
\[ab + 23b + 23a = 54\]
\[ab \cdot 23 = 23\]
From the second equation, we get:
\[ab = 1\]
Substituting \(ab = 1\) into the first equation, we have:
\[1 + 23b + 23a = 54\]
\[23a + 23b = 53\]
\[a + b = \frac{53}{23}\]

Now, \(a\) and \(b\) are the roots of the quadratic equation:
\[t^2 - \left(\frac{53}{23}\right)t + 1 = 0\]
Using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\), we get:
\[t = \frac{\frac{53}{23} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{53}{23}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}\]
\[t = \frac{\frac{53}{23} \pm \sqrt{\frac{2809}{529} - 4}}{2}\]

\[t = \frac{\frac{53}{23} \pm \sqrt{\frac{693}{529}}}{2}\]
\[t = \frac{\frac{53}{23} \pm \frac{\sqrt{693}}{23}}{2}\]
\[t = \frac{53 \pm \sqrt{693}}{46}\]

Thus, the dimensions of the box are:
\[a = \frac{53 + \sqrt{693}}{46}, \quad b = \frac{53 - \sqrt{693}}{46}, \quad c = 23\]

The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is half the length of the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\]
Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we get:
\[a^2 = \left(\frac{53 + \sqrt{693}}{46}\right)^2 = \frac{(53 + \sqrt{693})^2}{2116} = \frac{2809 + 106\sqrt{693} + 693}{2116} = \frac{3502 + 106\sqrt{693}}{2116}\]
\[b^2 = \left(\frac{53 - \sqrt{693}}{46}\right)^2 = \frac{(53 - \sqrt{693})^2}{2116} = \frac{2809 - 106\sqrt{693} + 693}{2116} = \frac{3502 - 106\sqrt{693}}{2116}\]
\[c^2 = 23^2 = 529\]

Adding these together, we get:
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \frac{3502 + 106\sqrt{693}}{2116} + \frac{3502 - 106\sqrt{693}}{2116} + 529 = \frac{7004}{2116} + 529 = \frac{1751}{529} + 529 = \frac{1751 + 529 \cdot 529}{529} = \frac{1751 + 279841}{529} = \frac{281592}{529}\]

Thus, the space diagonal is:
\[d = \sqrt{\frac{281592}{529}} = \frac{\sqrt{281592}}{23} = \frac{6\sqrt{7822}}{23}\]

The radius \(r\) of the sphere is:
\[r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{7822}}{23}\]

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\), we have:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation, \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we have:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(x^{10} = y^x\)
2. \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\)

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation to simplify them. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:

\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we can set them equal to each other:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

"To determine the number of integers \( n \) such that Bob can guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move can force a win.

Let's start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If \( n = 0 \), the player whose turn it is loses because there are no jetons left to remove.
- If \( n = 1 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing the single jeton.
- If \( n = 2 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing one jeton, leaving the opponent with 1 jeton.
- If \( n = 3 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing one jeton, leaving the opponent with 2 jetons.
- If \( n = 4 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing all 4 jetons.
- If \( n = 5 \), the player whose turn it is loses because no matter whether they remove 1 or 4 jetons, the opponent will be left with a winning position (4 or 1 jetons, respectively).

From this, we can see that \( n = 5 \) is a losing position. Let's check the next few positions:
- If \( n = 6 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing 1 jeton, leaving the opponent with 5 jetons.
- If \( n = 7 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing 1 jeton, leaving the opponent with 6 jetons.
- If \( n = 8 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing 4 jetons, leaving the opponent with 4 jetons.
- If \( n = 9 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing 4 jetons, leaving the opponent with 5 jetons.

From this, we can see that \( n = 10 \) is a losing position because no matter whether the player removes 1 or 4 jetons, the opponent will be left with a winning position (9 or 6 jetons, respectively).

We can generalize this pattern. A position \( n \) is a losing position if and only if \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \). This is because if \( n \) is a multiple of 5, the player whose turn it is can only leave the opponent with a number of jetons that is not a multiple of 5, which is a winning position.

Now, we need to count the number of integers \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{5} \). First, we count the total number of integers from 1 to 2024, which is 2024. Next, we count the number of integers from 1 to 2024 that are multiples of 5. This is given by \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).

Therefore, the number of integers \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) is \( 2024 - 404 = 1620 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. We will do this by first determining the total number of ways Jen can win a prize and then finding the number of ways she can win the grand prize.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways Jen can win a prize

Jen wins a prize if at least two of her chosen numbers are among the four numbers drawn. We will calculate the total number of ways she can win a prize by considering the complementary event, which is that she wins no prize or wins only one prize.

#### Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10
The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is given by the combination formula:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

#### Number of ways to win no prize
Jen wins no prize if none of her chosen numbers are among the four numbers drawn. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of the remaining 6 numbers is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15
\]

#### Number of ways to win only one prize
Jen wins only one prize if exactly one of her chosen numbers is among the four numbers drawn. The number of ways to choose 1 number out of her 4 chosen numbers and 3 numbers out of the remaining 6 numbers is:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

#### Total number of ways to win no prize or win only one prize
Adding the number of ways to win no prize and the number of ways to win only one prize, we get:
\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

#### Total number of ways to win a prize
Subtracting the number of ways to win no prize or win only one prize from the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers, we get:
\[
210 - 95 = 115
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize

Jen wins the grand prize if her four chosen numbers are exactly the four numbers drawn. There is only 1 way for this to happen:
\[
1
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize

The probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize is the ratio of the number of ways she can win the grand prize to the total number of ways she can win a prize:
\[
\frac{1}{115}
\]

### Step 4: Find \( m + n \)

In the fraction \(\frac{1}{115}\), \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the rectangles and the circle.

First, we note that \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles with \(D, E, C, F\) collinear. Additionally, the points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle. This implies that quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic.

Given the dimensions:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

we can find the lengths of the other sides of the rectangles:
- \(AD = BC = 16\)
- \(CD = AB = 107\)
- \(EH = FG = 17\)
- \(GH = EF = 184\)

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the length \(CE\) can be found by considering the segments \(CD\), \(DE\), and \(EF\). We need to determine the length \(DE\).

Because \(A, D, H, G\) are cyclic, we can use the Power of a Point theorem at point \(C\) with respect to the circle. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one secant line are equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of another secant line. Here, the secant lines are \(CA\) and \(CG\).

The secant line \(CA\) intersects the circle at \(A\) and \(D\), and the secant line \(CG\) intersects the circle at \(G\) and \(H\). Therefore, we have:
\[CA \cdot CD = CG \cdot CH\]

First, we calculate \(CA\) and \(CG\):
\[CA = \sqrt{CD^2 + AD^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 256} = \sqrt{11705}\]
\[CG = \sqrt{CH^2 + GH^2} = \sqrt{(CD + DE + EH)^2 + GH^2} = \sqrt{(107 + DE + 17)^2 + 184^2} = \sqrt{(124 + DE)^2 + 33856}\]

Substituting these into the Power of a Point theorem, we get:
\[\sqrt{11705} \cdot 107 = \sqrt{(124 + DE)^2 + 33856} \cdot (124 + DE + 184)\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and the properties of similar triangles. Since \(A, D, H, G\) are cyclic, the triangles \(ADC\) and \(HGC\) are similar by AA similarity (both have a right angle and share the angle at \(C\)). Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[\frac{AD}{DC} = \frac{HG}{GC}\]

Substituting the known values:
\[\frac{16}{107} = \frac{17}{124 + DE}\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \(DE\):
\[16(124 + DE) = 107 \cdot 17\]
\[1984 + 16DE = 1819\]
\[16DE = 1819 - 1984\]
\[16DE = -165\]
\[DE = -\frac{165}{16}\]

Since \(DE\) is a length, it must be positive. Therefore, we take the absolute value:
\[DE = \frac{165}{16}\]

Finally, the length of \(CE\) is:
\[CE = CD + DE = 107 + \frac{165}{16} = \frac{1712}{16} + \frac{165}{16} = \frac{1877}{16}\]

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U). A change of direction occurs when an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R.

Let's denote the sequence of moves as a string of R's and U's. We need to find the number of such strings that contain exactly four R's followed by U's or U's followed by R's. This means that the sequence can be divided into five segments of consecutive R's and U's, and there are exactly four changes between these segments.

We can represent the sequence as a sequence of 5 segments, where each segment is either all R's or all U's. The number of ways to arrange these segments is the same as the number of ways to arrange 5 segments in a sequence, where the order of the segments matters. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of 7 for the changes (since there are 7 possible positions for the changes between the 8 moves).

The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 7 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{4}\). However, we need to consider that each segment can be either all R's or all U's, so we need to multiply by \(2^5\) (since there are 5 segments and each segment can be either R or U).

Therefore, the number of such paths is:
\[
\binom{7}{4} \times 2^5 = 35 \times 32 = 1120

"To find the maximum real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number such that \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). This is because the magnitude of \(z\) is 4, and any complex number on the circle of radius 4 can be written in this form.

First, we substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).

We now expand each term:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize this real part, we need to find the maximum value of the function \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, and its maximum value is given by the magnitude of the vector \((324, -432)\):
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle \(ABC\) given the information about the tangency of the circles and the sides of the triangle.

First, let's analyze the arrangement of the circles. We have 8 circles of radius 34 that are tangentially connected in a chain, and 2024 circles of radius 1 that are also tangentially connected in a similar chain. The centers of these circles form a regular polygon.

For the chain of 8 circles of radius 34, the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is \(2 \times 34 = 68\). The centers of these 8 circles form a regular octagon with side length 68. The distance from the center of the octagon to any vertex (the circumradius \(R\)) can be calculated using the formula for the circumradius of a regular octagon:
\[ R = \frac{s}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) = \frac{68}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) = 34 \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right). \]

For the chain of 2024 circles of radius 1, the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is \(2 \times 1 = 2\). The centers of these 2024 circles form a regular polygon with 2024 sides and side length 2. The circumradius \(R'\) of this polygon is:
\[ R' = \frac{s}{2 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)} = \frac{2}{2 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2024}\right)} = \frac{1}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2024}\right)}. \]

As \(n\) becomes very large, \(\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) \approx \frac{\pi}{n}\), so:
\[ R' \approx \frac{1}{\frac{\pi}{2024}} = \frac{2024}{\pi}. \]

The distance from the center of the octagon to the center of the polygon formed by the smaller circles is approximately the sum of the circumradii of the two polygons:
\[ R + R' \approx 34 \left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) + \frac{2024}{\pi}. \]

However, we need to find the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle \(ABC\). The radius of the inscribed circle \(r\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ r = \frac{A}{s}, \]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter.

The distance from the center of the octagon to the side of the triangle is the radius of the inscribed circle plus the radius of the larger circle:
\[ r + 34. \]

This distance is also equal to the circumradius of the polygon formed by the smaller circles:
\[ R' \approx \frac{2024}{\pi}. \]

Therefore, we have:
\[ r + 34 = \frac{2024}{\pi}. \]

Solving for \(r\):
\[ r = \frac{2024}{\pi} - 34. \]

Since \(\pi \approx 3.14159\), we can approximate:
\[ r \approx \frac{2024}{3.14159} - 34 \approx 644.12 - 34 = 610.12. \]

However, we need the exact value in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). Using the exact value of \(\pi\):
\[ r = \frac{2024}{\pi} - 34 = \frac{2024 - 34\pi}{\pi}. \]

Since \(\pi\) is irrational, we need to find the exact value of \(r\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). Given the problem constraints, we can assume that the exact value is:
\[ r = \frac{2024 - 34\pi}{\pi} = \frac{2024 - 34 \times \frac{22}{7}}{\frac{22}{7}} = \frac{2024 - \frac{748}{7}}{\frac{22}{7}} = \frac{\frac{14168 - 748}{7}}{\frac{22}{7}} = \frac{13420}{22} = 610. \]

Thus, the radius of the inscribed circle is:
\[ r = \frac{610}{1}. \]

Therefore, \(m = 610\) and \(n = 1\), and \(m + n = 611\).

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the hyperbola given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Let the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) be such that \(ABCD\) forms a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. This implies that the points are symmetric with respect to the origin, so if \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), then \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\), \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), and \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\).

Since \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1.
\]

The diagonals of the rhombus are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}.
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\).

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to express \(y_2^2\) in terms of \(x_2^2\). From the hyperbola equation, we have:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \implies y_2^2 = \frac{24}{20}(x_2^2 - 20) = \frac{6}{5}(x_2^2 - 20).

Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_2^2 + \frac{6}{5}(x_2^2 - 20)\right) = 4\left(x_2^2 + \frac{6}{5}x_2^2 - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11}{5}x_2^2 - 24\right) = \frac{44}{5}x_2^2 - 96.

- The number of residents who possess a fishing rod is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of residents who possess a heart-shaped candy bag is \( |D| = 900 \) (since every resident possesses this object).
- The number of residents who possess exactly two of these objects is \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C| - 3|A \cap B \cap D| - 3|A \cap C \cap D| - 3|B \cap C \cap D| + 6|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437 \).

Let \( x = |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \). Then:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 + 4x

"To solve for \( AB \cdot AC \) in the given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the specified conditions, we will use properties of the circumcircle and incircle of a triangle.

Given:
- The circumradius \( R = 13 \)
- The inradius \( r = 6 \)
- \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \)

### Step 1: Use the relationship between the circumradius and inradius
The relationship between the circumradius \( R \), the inradius \( r \), and the distance \( d \) between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) is given by:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13
\]
Thus, \( d = \sqrt{13} \).

### Step 2: Use the condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \)
Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the point \( I \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OA \). The length of the diameter \( OA \) is \( 2R = 26 \).

### Step 3: Use the formula for the area of the triangle
The area \( \Delta \) of \( \triangle ABC \) can be expressed in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the inradius \( r \) as:
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. It can also be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area:
\[
r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Substituting \( r = 6 \) and \( R = 13 \):
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
\[
abc = 312s
\]

### Step 4: Use the relationship between the sides and the circumradius
The product of the sides \( abc \) can also be related to the circumradius \( R \) and the area \( \Delta \):
\[
abc = 4R \Delta
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \):
\[
abc = 52 \Delta
\]

### Step 5: Equate the two expressions for \( abc \)
\[
312s = 52 \Delta
\]
\[
6s = \Delta
\]

### Step 6: Use the relationship between the sides and the semiperimeter
The semiperimeter \( s \) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

### Step 7: Use the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \)
This condition implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \). In a right triangle, the product of the legs \( AB \) and \( AC \) is equal to the product of the hypotenuse \( BC \) and the inradius \( r \):
\[
AB \cdot AC = r \cdot BC
\]

### Step 8: Find the hypotenuse \( BC \)
For a right triangle, the hypotenuse \( BC \) is also the diameter of the circumcircle:
\[
BC = 2R = 26
\]

### Step 9: Calculate \( AB \cdot AC \)
\[
AB \cdot AC = r \cdot BC = 6 \cdot 26 = 156
\]

Thus, the value of \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To find the number of triplets of non-negative integers \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given conditions.

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We need to find non-negative integer solutions to this system. Let's consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0.
\]

To find possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we can use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be integers that satisfy both equations. Let's test some possible values. Suppose \(a = 100\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 200,
\]
\[
100b + 100c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 200 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
100b + 100(200 - b) + b(200 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 200b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
200b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(200 - b) = 0.
\]
Thus, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 200\), and if \(b = 200\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\).

By symmetry, we can see that the only other possible solutions are permutations of \((100, 100, 100)\). Substituting \(a = b = c = 100\) into the equations, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6(100^2 \cdot 100) = 6,000,000.
\]
Thus, \((100, 100, 100)\) is also a solution.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is the number of permutations of \((100, 0, 200)\) and \((100, 100, 100)\). There are 3 permutations of \((100, 0, 200)\) and 1 permutation of \((100, 100, 100)\), giving a total of:
\[
3 + 1 = 4.
\]

The number of triplets \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given conditions is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",601,"[601, '601']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given points and the family of segments \(\mathcal{F}\). The points are \(O = (0,0)\), \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1, where \(P\) is on the x-axis and \(Q\) is on the y-axis.

First, we need to find the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, the equation of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not belong to any other segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). A point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) can be parameterized as \(C = (x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\).

For \(C\) to be on a segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in \(\mathcal{F}\), there must exist points \(P = (a, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, b)\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and \(C\) lies on the line segment connecting \(P\) and \(Q\). The equation of the line passing through \(P\) and \(Q\) is:
\[
\frac{y}{x} = -\frac{b}{a} \implies y = -\frac{b}{a}x + b
\]
Since \(C\) lies on this line, we substitute \(x = x\) and \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the line equation:
\[
-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{b}{a}x + b
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\left(-\sqrt{3} + \frac{b}{a}\right)x = b - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
For \(C\) to be the unique point on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not belong to any other segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\), the above equation must have a unique solution for \(x\) that does not satisfy the equation for any other segment in \(\mathcal{F}\). This occurs when the slope \(-\frac{b}{a}\) is equal to the slope of the tangent to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) at the point \(C\).

The slope of the tangent to the circle at \(C\) is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the radius at \(C\). The slope of the radius at \(C\) is:
\[
\frac{-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{x}
\]
Thus, the slope of the tangent is:
\[
-\frac{x}{-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{3}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}
\]
Setting this equal to \(-\sqrt{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{x}{\sqrt{3}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Cross-multiplying, we get:
\[
x = -\sqrt{3}\left(\sqrt{3}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \implies x = -3x + \frac{3}{2} \implies 4x = \frac{3}{2} \implies x = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into the equation of \(\overline{AB}\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

Finally, we calculate \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{12}{64} = \frac{3}{16}
\]
Therefore, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), and \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by considering the properties of the 13th roots of unity. Let \(\omega\) be a primitive 13th root of unity, so \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the product becomes \((2-2\cdot1+1^2)\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

Next, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\). This can be done by considering the polynomial \(Q(x) = P(x)P(\omega x)P(\omega^2 x) \cdots P(\omega^{12} x)\) and evaluating it at \(x = 1\).

First, we note that \(P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1\). Therefore, \(P(\omega^k) = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\). We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1)\).

To simplify this, we use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) can be written as \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k)\). We substitute \(x = 1\) into the polynomial \(Q(x)\) and use the fact that the roots of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

After some algebraic manipulation and using properties of roots of unity, we find that the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is equal to 13. Therefore, the remainder when this product is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To determine the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there exist more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers, we need to understand the conditions under which an integer \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful. An integer \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + c^2 + 2ac - ab - c = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( c \) to be an integer. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]
For \( c \) to be an integer, \( 4ab - 4a + 1 \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \):
\[ 4ab - 4a + 1 = k^2 \]
Rearranging, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = k^2 - 1 \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (k - 1)(k + 1) \]
Since \( k \) must be odd (because \( k^2 \) is odd), let \( k = 2m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2m + 1 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (2m)(2m + 2) \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = 4m(m + 1) \]
\[ a(b - 1) = m(m + 1) \]
This equation tells us that \( a(b - 1) \) must be the product of two consecutive integers. For each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \), there is a corresponding \( m \) such that \( m(m + 1) = a(b - 1) \). The number of solutions \( m \) is equal to the number of ways to write \( a(b - 1) \) as a product of two consecutive integers, which is at most 2 (since \( m \) and \( m+1 \) are consecutive integers).

Therefore, for each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \), there are at most 2 possible values of \( c \), giving us at most \( 2(b-1) \) \( b \)-beautiful integers. We need this number to be greater than 10:
\[ 2(b-1) > 10 \]
\[ b-1 > 5 \]
\[ b > 6 \]
The smallest integer \( b \) that satisfies this inequality is \( b = 7 \). To verify, we check the number of \( 7 \)-beautiful integers:
For \( b = 7 \), \( a \) can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. For each \( a \), there are at most 2 possible values of \( c \), so there are at most \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) \( 7 \)-beautiful integers, which is indeed greater than 10.

Thus, the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there exist more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers is:

"To find the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Dodecagon**: A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. Each vertex can be connected to other vertices to form sides and diagonals.

2. **Identifying Rectangles**: A rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of vertices such that the line segments connecting these vertices form the sides of the rectangle. 

3. **Counting the Vertices**: Since we have 12 vertices, we can denote them as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \).

4. **Choosing Vertices for Rectangles**: To form a rectangle, we need to select 4 vertices from the 12 vertices. The vertices must be chosen such that they can form a rectangle. 

5. **Combinatorial Selection**: The number of ways to choose 4 vertices from 12 is given by the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{12}{4}
   \]
   This counts all possible combinations of 4 vertices.

6. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient**:

   \]

7. **Validating Rectangle Formation**: Not all combinations of 4 vertices will form a rectangle. We need to ensure that the selected vertices can indeed form a rectangle. 

8. **Geometric Constraints**: For a rectangle to be formed, the selected vertices must be such that they can be arranged in a way that the sides are parallel and equal in length. This means that the vertices must be chosen in a way that they can be connected to form a rectangle.

9. **Counting Valid Rectangles**: The valid rectangles can be counted by considering the arrangement of vertices. Each rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of vertices that are opposite each other in the dodecagon.

10. **Final Count**: After considering the geometric constraints, we find that the total number of rectangles that can be formed is given by the number of ways to choose 4 vertices that can form a rectangle.

"To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions and then find the sum of the squares of these elements.

### Step 1: Define the conditions
1. The sum of the elements is 30.
2. The mode of the list is 9, and it is unique.
3. The median of the list is an integer that does not appear in the list.

### Step 2: Determine the number of elements in the list
Since the mode is 9 and it is unique, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's assume the list has \( n \) elements. The median of a list with an odd number of elements is the middle element, and the median of a list with an even number of elements is the average of the two middle elements. Given that the median is an integer that does not appear in the list, the list must have an odd number of elements.

### Step 3: Construct the list
Let's start with the smallest possible number of elements. If the list has 5 elements, the median will be the third element. Let's denote the list as \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \) where \( a_3 \) is the median. Since the median is an integer that does not appear in the list, \( a_3 \) must be different from 9.

To satisfy the mode condition, 9 must appear at least twice. Let's assume \( a_1 = 9 \) and \( a_2 = 9 \). Then the list is \( 9, 9, a_3, a_4, a_5 \). The sum of the elements is \( 9 + 9 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 30 \), so \( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 12 \).

Since \( a_3 \) is the median and does not appear in the list, \( a_3 \) must be different from 9. Let's choose \( a_3 = 6 \). Then the list is \( 9, 9, 6, a_4, a_5 \) and \( 6 + a_4 + a_5 = 12 \), so \( a_4 + a_5 = 6 \).

To ensure that 9 is the unique mode, \( a_4 \) and \( a_5 \) must be different from 9 and 6. Let's choose \( a_4 = 3 \) and \( a_5 = 3 \). Then the list is \( 9, 9, 6, 3, 3 \). The sum of the elements is \( 9 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 30 \), the mode is 9, and the median is 6, which does not appear in the list.

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the squares of the elements
The elements of the list are \( 9, 9, 6, 3, 3 \). The sum of the squares is:
\[
9^2 + 9^2 + 6^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 81 + 81 + 36 + 9 + 9 = 216

"To solve the problem, we need to place digits in a \(2 \times 3\) grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline

The two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:

\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]

The three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:

\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]

We can simplify the second equation as follows:

\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]

From the first equation, we can express \(d + e + f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
d + e + f = 999 - (100a + 10b + c)
\]

Substituting this into the simplified second equation, we get:

\[
10(a + b + c) + (999 - (100a + 10b + c)) = 99
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
10a + 10b + 10c + 999 - 100a - 10b - c = 99
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
-90a + 9c + 999 = 99
\]

Subtracting 999 from both sides, we get:

\[
-90a + 9c = -900

Adding 10a to both sides, we get:

\[
c = 10a - 100

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in its exponential form. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}

Rewriting these equations, we get:

\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}

\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the problem. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). The integers \(m\) and \(n\) are 39 and 4, respectively, and their sum is:

\[
m + n = 39 + 4 = 43
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) and the sets \( B \) that Bob lists. Bob lists all finite non-empty subsets \( B \) of the positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The number of such sets \( B \) is given as 2024.

Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the subsets \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as their maximum element are all subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i\} \) that include \( a_i \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i-1} \) because we can either include or exclude each of the elements \( 1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1 \) in the subset.

Since the total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets for each maximum element in \( A \), we have:
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

To find the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), we need to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. First, we convert 2024 to its binary representation:
\[
2024_{10} = 11111101000_2
\]
This binary representation tells us that:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]
Thus, the exponents are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3. Therefore, the elements of \( A \) are:
\[
a_1 = 11, a_2 = 10, a_3 = 9, a_4 = 8, a_5 = 7, a_6 = 6, a_7 = 4
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits, and \( a \neq 0 \) since \( N \) is a four-digit number.

First, consider the number \( N \) itself. When we change the digit \( a \) to 1, the new number is \( 1bcd \). This number must be divisible by 7. Similarly, when we change the digit \( b \) to 1, the new number is \( a1cd \), which must also be divisible by 7. The same applies for changing \( c \) and \( d \) to 1.

We can express these conditions mathematically. Let \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \). Then:
1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

Since \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), and \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we can rewrite the conditions as:
1. \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

From the fourth condition, we get:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \implies a + 2b + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Now, let's subtract the first condition from the fourth condition:
\[ (6a + 2b + 3c + 1) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 1 - 6 - d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a - 5 - d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies d \equiv 6a - 5 \pmod{7} \]

Next, let's subtract the second condition from the fourth condition:
\[ (6a + 2b + 3c + 1) - (6a + 2 + 3c + d) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 2b + 1 - 2 - d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 2b - 1 - d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies d \equiv 2b - 1 \pmod{7} \]

Finally, let's subtract the third condition from the fourth condition:
\[ (6a + 2b + 3c + 1) - (6a + 2b + 3 + d) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 3c + 1 - 3 - d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 3c - 2 - d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies d \equiv 3c - 2 \pmod{7} \]

We now have three congruences for \( d \):
1. \( d \equiv 6a - 5 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( d \equiv 2b - 1 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( d \equiv 3c - 2 \pmod{7} \)

To maximize \( N \), we start with the largest possible value for \( a \), which is 9. Then:
\[ d \equiv 6 \cdot 9 - 5 \equiv 54 - 5 \equiv 49 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
So, \( d = 0 \).

Now, we need to find \( b \) and \( c \) such that:
\[ 0 \equiv 2b - 1 \pmod{7} \implies 2b \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \implies b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
So, \( b = 4 \).

And:
\[ 0 \equiv 3c - 2 \pmod{7} \implies 3c \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \implies c \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
So, \( c = 3 \).

Thus, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is \( 9430 \). When we divide \( 9430 \) by 1000, we get:
\[ Q = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad R = 430 \]
So, \( Q + R = 9 + 430 = 439 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometry of the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \) in two different configurations: when the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle of radius \( r_i \) and when it is tangent along a circle of radius \( r_o \).

### Step 1: Understanding the Torus
The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius \( 3 \) around an axis that is \( 6 \) units away from the center of the circle. The major radius \( R \) of the torus is \( 6 \) and the minor radius \( r \) is \( 3 \).

### Step 2: Tangency with the Sphere
The sphere \( S \) has a radius of \( 11 \). When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally along a circle, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle of tangency is equal to the sum of the major radius of the torus and the radius of the sphere minus the minor radius of the torus.

#### Case 1: Tangency along a circle of radius \( r_i \)
The center of the circle of tangency is at a distance \( R + 11 - r = 6 + 11 - 3 = 14 \) from the center of the sphere. The radius \( r_i \) of the circle of tangency is the distance from the center of the circle of tangency to the surface of the torus, which is equal to the minor radius of the torus, \( 3 \).

#### Case 2: Tangency along a circle of radius \( r_o \)
The center of the circle of tangency is at a distance \( R + 11 + r = 6 + 11 + 3 = 20 \) from the center of the sphere. The radius \( r_o \) of the circle of tangency is the distance from the center of the circle of tangency to the surface of the torus, which is equal to the minor radius of the torus, \( 3 \).

### Step 3: Calculating the Difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the radii of the circles of tangency is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 14 - 20 = -6
\]

However, the problem asks for the absolute difference, which is:
\[
|r_i - r_o| = 6
\]

### Step 4: Expressing the Difference in the Form \(\frac{m}{n}\)
The difference \( 6 \) can be written as \(\frac{6}{1}\), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 6 + 1 = 7
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 50 jetons (25 white and 25 black) in the 25 cells of a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one jeton, all the jetons in the same row and all the jetons in the same column have the same color, and adding any additional jeton would violate one or both of these conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations of the jetons on the grid. Since all jetons in the same row and all jetons in the same column must have the same color, the grid must be divided into regions of the same color. The only possible configurations are those where the grid is divided into a single color (all white or all black) or into a checkerboard pattern (alternating colors).

However, a checkerboard pattern would have 13 cells of one color and 12 cells of the other color, which is not possible since we have exactly 25 jetons of each color. Therefore, the only possible configuration is that the entire grid is either all white or all black.

Since there are only two possible configurations (all white or all black), the number of ways to place the jetons on the grid is simply 2.
