"To determine the number of intersections of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we first need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

The function \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( |x| < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).

The function \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( |x| < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \):
- Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) both range from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to consider the behavior of \( f(x) \) in this interval.
- For \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) in \([-1, -\frac{1}{2}]\) or \([\frac{1}{2}, 1]\), \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) in \([- \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2 \pi x)| \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3 \pi y)| \).

Now, we evaluate \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \):
- Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) range from \(-\frac{1}{2}\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\), we need to consider the behavior of \( g(x) \) in this interval.
- For \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) in \([- \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}]\) or \([\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}]\), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| - \frac{1}{4} \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) in \([- \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}]\), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - |f(\sin(2 \pi x))| \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - |f(\cos(3 \pi y))| \).

Finally, we need to find the number of intersections of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \). Since both functions are periodic and symmetric, we can analyze the behavior over one period and then extend it to the entire domain.

By symmetry and periodicity, the graphs intersect at 16 points in the interval \([0, 1] \times [0, 1]\). Therefore, the total number of intersections is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",385,"[385, '385']",False

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln(x) = x \ln(y) \implies \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation:

\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln(y) = 4y \ln(x) \implies \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Since both expressions equal \(\frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)}\), we can set them equal to each other:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) not exceeding 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions.

### Step 1: Define Winning and Losing Positions
- A position is a **winning position** if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
- A position is a **losing position** if any move the player makes leaves the opponent in a winning position.

### Step 2: Identify Base Cases
- If \( n = 1 \): The player can take the last token and wins. Thus, \( n = 1 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 2 \): The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who wins. Thus, \( n = 2 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 3 \): The player can take 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent, who loses. Thus, \( n = 3 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 4 \): The player can take 4 tokens and win. Thus, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 5 \): The player can take 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who wins. Thus, \( n = 5 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 6 \): The player can take 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the opponent, who loses. Thus, \( n = 6 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 7 \): The player can take 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the opponent, who wins. Thus, \( n = 7 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 8 \): The player can take 4 tokens, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who wins. Thus, \( n = 8 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 9 \): The player can take 1 token, leaving 8 tokens for the opponent, who loses. Thus, \( n = 9 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 10 \): The player can take 1 token, leaving 9 tokens for the opponent, who wins. Thus, \( n = 10 \) is a losing position.

### Step 3: Identify a Pattern
From the above analysis, we can summarize the winning and losing positions:
- Winning positions: \( 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45, 46, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58, 60, 61, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 70, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 79, 81, 82, 84, 85, 87, 88, 90, 91, 93, 94, 96, 97, 99, 100, 102, 103, 105, 106, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114, 115, 117, 118, 120, 121, 123, 124, 126, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 135, 136, 138, 139, 141, 142, 144, 145, 147, 148, 150, 151, 153, 154, 156, 157, 159, 160, 162, 163, 165, 166, 168, 169, 171, 172, 174, 175, 177, 178, 180, 181, 183, 184, 186, 187, 189, 190, 192, 193, 195, 196, 198, 199, 201, 202, 204, 205, 207, 208, 210, 211, 213, 214, 216, 217, 219, 220, 222, 223, 225, 226, 228, 229, 231, 232, 234, 235, 237, 238, 240, 241, 243, 244, 246, 247, 249, 250, 252, 253, 255, 256, 258, 259, 261, 262, 264, 265, 267, 268, 270, 271, 273, 274, 276, 277, 279, 280, 282, 283, 285, 286, 288, 289, 291, 292, 294, 295, 297, 298, 300, 301, 303, 304, 306, 307, 309, 310, 312, 313, 315, 316, 318, 319, 321, 322, 324, 325, 327, 328, 330, 331, 333, 334, 336, 337, 339, 340, 342, 343, 345, 346, 348, 349, 351, 352, 354, 355, 357, 358, 360, 361, 363, 364, 366, 367, 369, 370, 372, 373, 375, 376, 378, 379, 381, 382, 384, 385, 387, 388, 390, 391, 393, 394, 396, 397, 399, 400, 402, 403, 405, 406, 408, 409, 411, 412, 414, 415, 417, 418, 420, 421, 423, 424, 426, 427, 429, 430, 432, 433, 435, 436, 438, 439, 441, 442, 444, 445, 447, 448, 450, 451, 453, 454, 456, 457, 459, 460, 462, 463, 465, 466, 468, 469, 471, 472, 474, 475, 477, 478, 480, 481, 483, 484, 486, 487, 489, 490, 492, 493, 495, 496, 498, 499, 501, 502, 504, 505, 507, 508, 510, 511, 513, 514, 516, 517, 519, 520, 522, 523, 525, 526, 528, 529, 531, 532, 534, 535, 537, 538, 540, 541, 543, 544, 546, 547, 549, 550, 552, 553, 555, 556, 558, 559, 561, 562, 564, 565, 567, 568, 570, 571, 573, 574, 576, 577, 579, 580, 582, 583, 585, 586, 588, 589, 591, 592, 594, 595, 597, 598, 600, 601, 603, 604, 606, 607, 609, 610, 612, 613, 615, 616, 618, 619, 621, 622, 624, 625, 627, 628, 630, 631, 633, 634, 636, 637, 639, 640, 642, 643, 645, 646, 648, 649, 651, 652, 654, 655, 657, 658, 660, 661, 663, 664, 666, 667, 669, 670, 672, 673, 675, 676, 678, 679, 681, 682, 684, 685, 687, 688, 690, 691, 693, 694, 696, 697, 699, 700, 702, 703, 705, 706, 708, 709, 711, 712, 714, 715, 717, 718, 720, 721, 723, 724, 726, 727, 729, 730, 732, 733, 735, 736, 738, 739, 741, 742, 744, 745, 747, 748, 750, 751, 753, 754, 756, 757, 759, 760, 762, 763, 765, 766, 768, 769, 771, 772, 774, 775, 777, 778, 780, 781, 783, 784, 786, 787, 789, 790, 792, 793, 795, 796, 798, 799, 801, 802, 804, 805, 807, 808, 810, 811, 813, 814, 816, 817, 819, 820, 822, 823, 825, 826, 828, 829, 831, 832, 834, 835, 837, 838, 840, 841, 843, 844","[844, '844']",809,"[809, '809']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths of length 16 that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, and change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U).

A path that changes direction exactly four times must have exactly four segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, a path might look like RRRRUUUU RRRRUUUU or UUUURRRR UUUURRRR, etc. The key is to determine the number of ways to arrange these segments.

First, we need to choose the positions of the direction changes. Since there are 16 moves in total and 4 direction changes, there are 5 segments in total. We need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (after each move except the last one) for the direction changes. This can be done in \(\binom{15}{4}\) ways.

Next, we need to determine the number of ways to assign the segments to right moves and up moves. Since there are 5 segments and each segment can either be a sequence of right moves or a sequence of up moves, there are \(2^5 = 32\) ways to assign the segments.

However, we need to ensure that the path starts with a right move and ends with an up move (or vice versa) to reach the top-right corner. This means that the number of right moves and up moves in the segments must be such that the total number of right moves is 8 and the total number of up moves is 8. This is always true because we have exactly 8 right moves and 8 up moves in total.

Therefore, the total number of paths is the number of ways to choose the positions of the direction changes multiplied by the number of ways to assign the segments:
\[
\binom{15}{4} \times 32
\]

First, we calculate \(\binom{15}{4}\):
\[
\binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4! \cdot 11!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365

Next, we multiply by 32:

1365 \times 32 = 43680

"To find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the conditions \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We need to find non-negative integer solutions to this system. Let's consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0.
\]

To find possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we can use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be integers that satisfy both equations. Let's test some possible values. Suppose \(a = 100\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 200,
\]
\[
100b + 100c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 200 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
100b + 100(200 - b) + b(200 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 200b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
200b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(200 - b) = 0.
\]
Thus, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 200\), and if \(b = 200\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\).

By symmetry, we can see that the same solutions will be obtained if we start with \(b = 100\) or \(c = 100\). Therefore, the only solutions are the permutations of \((100, 0, 200)\).

Thus, there are 3 such triples. The answer is:

"To find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible combinations of vertices that can form the corners of these rectangles.

A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is defined by choosing 4 vertices such that the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. This means that the vertices must be chosen in such a way that they form a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel.

We can approach this problem by considering the possible sets of vertices that can form the corners of the rectangles. Each set of 4 vertices that form a rectangle must be chosen such that the vertices are symmetric with respect to the center of the dodecagon. This is because the dodecagon is regular, and any set of 4 vertices that form a rectangle must be equidistant from the center.

To count the number of such sets, we can use the fact that each set of 4 vertices corresponds to a unique pair of opposite sides of the dodecagon. There are 6 pairs of opposite sides in a dodecagon, and each pair of opposite sides can be used to form a rectangle by choosing the other two vertices that are also opposite to each other.

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 pairs of opposite sides from the 6 pairs of opposite sides. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \).

Calculating this, we get:
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to place digits in a \(2 \times 3\) grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column is 99.

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
The two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
From this equation, we can see that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\).

Next, the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]
From this equation, we can see that \(a + b + c = 9\) and \(d + e + f = 9\).

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \(a + d = 9\)
2. \(b + e = 9\)
3. \(c + f = 9\)
4. \(a + b + c = 9\)
5. \(d + e + f = 9\)

From equations 1, 2, and 3, we can express \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 9 - a, \quad e = 9 - b, \quad f = 9 - c
\]
Substituting these into equations 4 and 5, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 9

\[
(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 9 \implies 27 - (a + b + c) = 9 \implies 27 - 9 = 9 \implies 18 = 9
\]
The second equation is always true given the first equation. Therefore, the only constraint is \(a + b + c = 9\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits from 0 to 9.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(a + b + c = 9\) is given by the ""stars and bars"" theorem, which is \(\binom{9+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{11}{2} = 55\).

For each solution \((a, b, c)\), there is a corresponding solution \((d, e, f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c)\). Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 55.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 50 indistinguishable white and black chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in one row and all chips in one column are of the same color, and any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or both of these conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations of the chips. Since all chips in one row and all chips in one column must be of the same color, the chips must form a single block of the same color in the grid. This block can be of any size from \(1 \times 1\) to \(5 \times 5\), and it can be either white or black.

For a block of size \(k \times l\) (where \(1 \leq k, l \leq 5\)), there are \((6-k)(6-l)\) possible positions on the grid. Since the block can be either white or black, there are \(2(6-k)(6-l)\) configurations for each block size \(k \times l\).

We need to sum these configurations for all possible block sizes. The total number of configurations is given by:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{5} \sum_{l=1}^{5} 2(6-k)(6-l)
\]

First, we calculate the inner sum:
\[
\sum_{l=1}^{5} (6-l) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15
\]

Now, we substitute this result into the outer sum:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{5} 2 \cdot 15 = 2 \cdot 15 \cdot 5 = 150
\]

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the chips is:
\[
\boxed{150}
