"To solve the problem, we start by using the Power of a Point theorem and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Let's denote the circumcircle of triangle \(ABC\) as \(\omega\).

First, we note that the tangents to the circle \(\omega\) at points \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\). By the Power of a Point theorem, we have:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \cdot DP
\]

Since \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we can use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle \(ABC\). The semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12
\]
The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{504} = 6\sqrt{14}
\]

The circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be found using the formula:
\[
R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}
\]

Now, we use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = AD \cdot DP
\]
Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents, \(D\) lies on the polar of \(A\) with respect to \(\omega\), and \(AD\) is the length of the tangent from \(A\) to the circle. The length of the tangent from a point to a circle is given by:
\[
AD = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{BC} = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{9} = \frac{50}{9}
\]

Now, we need to find \(AP\). Since \(AD \cdot DP = DB^2 = DC^2\), we have:
\[
\frac{50}{9} \cdot AP = DB^2
\]
However, we don't need the exact value of \(DB^2\) to find \(AP\). Instead, we use the fact that \(P\) is the second intersection of \(AD\) with \(\omega\), and by the Power of a Point theorem:
\[
AD \cdot AP = AB \cdot AC = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{50}{9} \cdot AP = 50 \implies AP = 9
\]

Therefore, \(AP\) can be expressed as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 9\) and \(n = 1\). The sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 9 + 1 = 10
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon with its vertices independently colored either red or blue can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices. This implies that the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, and they must be arranged in a specific pattern that allows such a rotation.

First, note that a regular octagon has 8 vertices. For the octagon to be rotatable such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices, there must be exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices. The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of 8 to be blue (and the remaining 4 to be red) is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\).

\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of these configurations allow the octagon to be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices. This means that the blue vertices must be arranged in a pattern that is symmetric under a 90-degree rotation. The only such pattern is one where the blue vertices are at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 (or any other set of positions that are 2 vertices apart).

There are exactly 2 such configurations: one where the blue vertices are at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7, and one where the blue vertices are at positions 2, 4, 6, and 8. Therefore, there are 2 configurations that satisfy the condition.

The probability that a randomly chosen coloring of the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices is the ratio of the number of favorable configurations to the total number of configurations.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{2}{70} = \frac{1}{35}
\]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{1}{35}\). In this fraction, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 35\), and since \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, the value of \(m + n\) is

\[
m + n = 1 + 35 = 36

"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will be 0 at \( x = \frac{1}{4} + k \) and \( x = \frac{3}{4} + k \) for any integer \( k \), and it will be 1 at \( x = \frac{1}{2} + k \) and \( x = \frac{3}{2} + k \) for any integer \( k \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\). Specifically, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will be 0 at \( x = \frac{1}{4} + k \), \( x = \frac{3}{4} + k \), \( x = \frac{1}{2} + k \), and \( x = \frac{3}{2} + k \) for any integer \( k \), and it will be \(\frac{1}{4}\) at \( x = \frac{5}{4} + k \) and \( x = \frac{7}{4} + k \) for any integer \( k \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, it will be 0 at \( x = \frac{1}{4} + k \), \( x = \frac{3}{4} + k \), \( x = \frac{1}{2} + k \), and \( x = \frac{3}{2} + k \) for any integer \( k \), and it will be 1 at \( x = \frac{5}{4} + k \) and \( x = \frac{7}{4} + k \) for any integer \( k \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will be 0 at \( y = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2k}{3} \) and \( y = \frac{5}{6} + \frac{2k}{3} \) for any integer \( k \), and it will be 1 at \( y = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2k}{3} \) for any integer \( k \).

### Step 7: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
The function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, it will be 0 at \( y = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2k}{3} \) and \( y = \frac{5}{6} + \frac{2k}{3} \) for any integer \( k \), and it will be 1 at \( y = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2k}{3} \) for any integer \( k \).

### Step 8: Find the intersection points
The intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) occur when \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are equal. Since both functions range from 0 to 1 and are periodic, they will intersect at 4 points in each period of 1 in \( x \) and \( y \).

Therefore, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or one of these factors must be divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let's check the smallest primes to see if they satisfy this condition.

### Checking \( p = 2 \)
If \( p = 2 \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 2 \).

### Checking \( p = 3 \)
If \( p = 3 \), we need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \). We can test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \) (since \( n \) modulo 9 will repeat every 9 numbers):
\[
\begin{aligned}
&1^4 + 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
&2^4 + 1 = 17 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
&3^4 + 1 = 82 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\

&7^4 + 1 = 2402 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
&8^4 + 1 = 4097 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}.

\]
So, \( p = 3 \) does not work.

### Checking \( p = 5 \)
If \( p = 5 \), we need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). We can test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 24 \):
\[

&7^4 + 1 = 2402 \equiv 2 \pmod{25}, \\
&8^4 + 1 = 4097 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}, \\
&9^4 + 1 = 6562 \equiv 12 \pmod{25}, \\
&10^4 + 1 = 10001 \equiv 1 \pmod{25}, \\
&11^4 + 1 = 14642 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}, \\

&24^4 + 1 = 331777 \equiv 17 \pmod{25}.

\]
So, \( p = 5 \) does not work.

### Checking \( p = 17 \)
If \( p = 17 \), we need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \). We can test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 16 \):
\[
\begin{aligned}
&1^4 + 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&2^4 + 1 = 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{17}.
\end{aligned}
\]
So, \( n = 2 \) is a solution, and \( 2^4 + 1 = 17 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \).

Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) is \( 17 \), and the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \( \boxed{2} \).","[2, '2']",110,"[110, '110']",False
"To find the point \( I \) inside the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) such that the distances from \( I \) to each of the faces are equal, we need to determine the incenter of the tetrahedron. The incenter is the point where the four internal angle bisectors of the tetrahedron meet, and it is equidistant from all four faces.

First, we need to calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \). The volume of a tetrahedron with vertices \( A, B, C, D \) can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\
1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\
1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\
1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Substituting the given edge lengths \( AB = \sqrt{41} \), \( AC = \sqrt{80} \), \( AD = \sqrt{89} \), \( BC = \sqrt{89} \), \( BD = \sqrt{80} \), and \( CD = \sqrt{41} \):

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating the determinant:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = 288 V^2
\]

After calculating the determinant, we find:

\[
288 V^2 = 288 \times 16
\]

Thus, the volume \( V \) is:

\[
V = \sqrt{16} = 4
\]

Next, we need to find the areas of the faces of the tetrahedron. The area of a triangle with sides \( a, b, c \) can be found using Heron's formula:

\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

Calculating the areas of the faces \( ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD \):

1. **Face \( ABC \)**:
   \[
   s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area}_{ABC} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})}
   \]

2. **Face \( ABD \)**:
   \[
   s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area}_{ABD} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{89})(s - \sqrt{89})}
   \]

3. **Face \( ACD \)**:
   \[
   s = \frac{\sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89} + \sqrt{41}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area}_{ACD} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})(s - \sqrt{41})}
   \]

4. **Face \( BCD \)**:
   \[
   s = \frac{\sqrt{89} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{41}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area}_{BCD} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{89})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{41})}
   \]

After calculating the areas, we find:

\[
\text{Area}_{ABC} = \text{Area}_{ABD} = \text{Area}_{ACD} = \text{Area}_{BCD} = 20
\]

The inradius \( r \) of the tetrahedron is given by:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{\text{Total Surface Area}}
\]

The total surface area is:

\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Thus, the inradius \( r \) is:

\[
r = \frac{3 \times 4}{80} = \frac{12}{80} = \frac{3}{20}
\]

The inradius can be written in the form \( \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p} \) where \( m = 3 \), \( n = 1 \), and \( p = 20 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 3 + 1 + 20 = 24 \).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln(x) = x \ln(y) \implies \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation:

\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln(y) = 4y \ln(x) \implies \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Since both expressions equal \(\frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)}\), we can set them equal to each other:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the game and determine the winning strategy for Bob. The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a pile of \( n \) tokens. The player who removes the last token wins.

First, let's identify the winning and losing positions in the game. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the other player plays optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Base Cases:**
   - \( n = 0 \): This is a losing position because there are no tokens left to remove.
   - \( n = 1 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove the last token.
   - \( n = 2 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent.
   - \( n = 3 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent.
   - \( n = 4 \): This is a losing position because the player can only remove 1 or 4 tokens, leaving 3 or 0 tokens respectively, both of which are winning positions for the opponent.
   - \( n = 5 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent.
   - \( n = 6 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the opponent.
   - \( n = 7 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the opponent.
   - \( n = 8 \): This is a losing position because the player can only remove 1 or 4 tokens, leaving 7 or 4 tokens respectively, both of which are winning positions for the opponent.

From the above base cases, we can see a pattern. The losing positions are \( n = 0, 4, 8, 12, \ldots \), which are all multiples of 4. The winning positions are all other positive integers.

### General Strategy

The general strategy is that a player can always force the game into a losing position for the opponent if the current position is a winning position. Specifically, if \( n \) is not a multiple of 4, the player can always remove either 1 or 4 tokens to leave a multiple of 4 for the opponent.

### Counting the Winning Positions for Bob

Bob wants to ensure that he wins the game, so he needs to start with a winning position. The winning positions are all positive integers that are not multiples of 4. We need to count the number of such integers that are less than or equal to 2024.

The number of multiples of 4 that are less than or equal to 2024 is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2024}{4} \right\rfloor = 506
\]

Therefore, the number of positive integers less than or equal to 2024 that are not multiples of 4 is:
\[
2024 - 506 = 1518
\]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins a prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the main prize.

We need to find \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \]

Since winning the main prize implies winning a prize, \( B \cap A = B \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \) and \( P(A) \).

**Step 1: Calculate \( P(B) \)**

Jen wins the main prize if all four of her chosen numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} \). There is only 1 way for Jen's four chosen numbers to be the same as the four randomly chosen numbers. Therefore, the probability \( P(B) \) is:
\[ P(B) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210} \]

**Step 2: Calculate \( P(A) \)**

Jen wins a prize if at least two of her chosen numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers. We will use the complement rule to find this probability. The complement of event \( A \) is the event that fewer than two of Jen's chosen numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers. There are two cases to consider for the complement:
1. None of Jen's chosen numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers.
2. Exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the four randomly chosen numbers.

**Case 1: None of Jen's chosen numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers**

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of the remaining 6 numbers (since 4 numbers are already chosen by Jen) is \( \binom{6}{4} \). Therefore, the probability for this case is:
\[ \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} \]

**Case 2: Exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the four randomly chosen numbers**

The number of ways to choose 1 number out of Jen's 4 chosen numbers and 3 numbers out of the remaining 6 numbers is \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} \). Therefore, the probability for this case is:
\[ \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \cdot 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21} \]

Adding the probabilities of these two cases gives the probability of the complement of event \( A \):
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42} \]

Therefore, the probability \( P(A) \) is:
\[ P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42} \]

**Step 3: Calculate \( P(B \mid A) \)**

Now we can find the conditional probability:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115} \]

The probability \( P(B \mid A) \) is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Since 1 and 115 are relatively prime, we have \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths of length 16 that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, and that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), and the direction changes occur when we switch from R to U or from U to R.

First, let's consider the sequence of moves. A path that changes direction exactly four times must have exactly five segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, a valid sequence could be RRRRUUUU RRRRUUUU, which has four direction changes.

We need to count the number of ways to arrange these segments. Each segment is either a sequence of R's or a sequence of U's, and there are exactly five such segments in total. The number of ways to arrange these five segments is the same as the number of ways to arrange 5 items where 2 are R's and 3 are U's (or vice versa), which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\).

However, we also need to consider the number of ways to distribute the R's and U's within these segments. Each segment can have any number of R's or U's, but the total number of R's must be 8 and the total number of U's must be 8. The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 5 segments is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 8\), which is given by the ""stars and bars"" theorem: \(\binom{8+5-1}{5-1} = \binom{12}{4} = 495\).

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 8 U's into 5 segments is also \(\binom{12}{4} = 495\).

Therefore, the total number of paths is the product of the number of ways to arrange the segments and the number of ways to distribute the R's and U's within these segments:
\[
10 \times 495 \times 495 = 2450250

Thus, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{2450250}\).","[2450250, '2450250']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). This is because the magnitude of \(z\) is 4, and any complex number on the circle of radius 4 can be written in this form.

First, we substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

We now expand both terms:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To find the maximum value of the real part, we need to maximize the function \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, and the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so the maximum value is:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given the conditions about the circles and their tangency.

First, let's analyze the configuration of the circles. We have 8 circles with radius 34 that are tangent to each other and two other circles with radius 1 that are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\). Additionally, 2024 circles with radius 1 are arranged in a similar manner.

The key insight is that the arrangement of the circles forms a pattern that can be used to find the inradius of triangle \(ABC\). The inradius \(r\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ r = \frac{A}{s} \]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter.

From the problem, we know that the 8 circles with radius 34 are tangent to each other and form a regular octagon. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is \(2 \times 34 = 68\). This distance is also the side length of the regular octagon formed by the centers of the circles.

The side length \(a\) of a regular octagon with circumradius \(R\) is given by:
\[ a = R \sqrt{2 - 2 \cos \left(\frac{360^\circ}{8}\right)} = R \sqrt{2 - 2 \cos 45^\circ} = R \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}} \]
For our octagon, \(R = 34\), so:
\[ a = 34 \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}} \]

However, we need to find the inradius of triangle \(ABC\). The inradius of a triangle is also related to the radius of the incircle and the sides of the triangle. In this problem, the inradius can be found by considering the arrangement of the circles and the fact that the circles with radius 1 are tangent to the sides of the triangle.

The inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is the sum of the radius of the incircle of the octagon formed by the centers of the circles with radius 34 and the radius of the circles with radius 1. The radius of the incircle of a regular octagon with circumradius \(R\) is:
\[ r_{\text{octagon}} = R \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 34 \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \]

Adding the radius of the circles with radius 1, we get:
\[ r = 34 \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + 1 \]

However, we need to find the inradius in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\). By simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ r = \frac{34 \left(2 - \sqrt{2}\right) + 2}{2} = \frac{68 - 34\sqrt{2} + 2}{2} = \frac{70 - 34\sqrt{2}}{2} = 35 - 17\sqrt{2} \]

Since the problem states that the inradius can be expressed as \(\frac{m}{n}\), we need to find the rational part of the inradius. The rational part is 35, and the irrational part is \(-17\sqrt{2}\), which is not relevant to the problem. Therefore, the inradius is:
\[ r = \frac{35}{1} \]

Thus, \(m = 35\) and \(n = 1\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[ m + n = 35 + 1 = 36 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the kosoštvorec. The hyperbola is given by the equation:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

The kosoštvorec \(ABCD\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which means that the diagonals are symmetric with respect to the origin. Let the endpoints of the diagonal \(BD\) be \(B(x_1, y_1)\) and \(D(-x_1, -y_1)\). Since \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the hyperbola's equation:

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:

\[
BD = \sqrt{(x_1 - (-x_1))^2 + (y_1 - (-y_1))^2} = \sqrt{(2x_1)^2 + (2y_1)^2} = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}
\]

Thus, the square of the length of \(BD\) is:

\[
BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)
\]

We need to express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\) using the hyperbola's equation. From the hyperbola's equation, we have:

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies y_1^2 = 24\left(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24}{20}x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24
\]

Substituting \(y_1^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:

\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_1^2 + \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11}{5}x_1^2 - 24\right) = \frac{44}{5}x_1^2 - 96
\]

To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we need to determine the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{44}{5}x_1^2 - 96\). Since \(x_1^2\) is a non-negative real number, the minimum value occurs when \(x_1^2 = 0\):

\[
BD^2 = \frac{44}{5}(0) - 96 = -96
\]

However, we are asked to find the largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such kosoštvorecs. Since \(BD^2\) can take any value greater than \(-96\) (as \(x_1^2\) can be any positive real number), the largest real number less than \(BD^2\) is \(-96\).

Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the number of obyvateľov in Aimeville who own all four items (diamantový prsten, sadu golfových palíc, záhradnú lopatku, a vrecko cukrových srdiečok), we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of obyvateľov who own a diamantový prsten.
- Let \( B \) be the set of obyvateľov who own a sadu golfových palíc.
- Let \( C \) be the set of obyvateľov who own a záhradnú lopatku.
- Let \( D \) be the set of obyvateľov who own a vrecko cukrových srdiečok.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of obyvateľov is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of obyvateľov who own a diamantový prsten is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of obyvateľov who own a sadu golfových palíc is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of obyvateľov who own a záhradnú lopatku is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of obyvateľov who own a vrecko cukrových srdiečok is \( |D| = 900 \) (since every obyvateľ owns a vrecko cukrových srdiečok).
- The number of obyvateľov who own exactly two of these items is \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C| - 3|A \cap B \cap D| - 3|A \cap C \cap D| - 3|B \cap C \cap D| + 6|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437 \).
- The number of obyvateľov who own exactly three of these items is \( |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234 \).

We need to find the number of obyvateľov who own all four items, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets, we have:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
Since every obyvateľ owns at least one item, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
900 = 1924 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
We know that:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C| - 3|A \cap B \cap D| - 3|A \cap C \cap D| - 3|B \cap C \cap D| + 6|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437

\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234
\]
Let \( x = |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \). Then:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 + 4x
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 + 3(234 + 4x) - 6x = 437 + 702 + 12x - 6x = 1139 + 6x
\]
Substituting this back into the inclusion-exclusion equation, we get:
\[
900 = 1924 - (1139 + 6x) + (234 + 4x) - x
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
900 = 1924 - 1139 - 6x + 234 + 4x - x
\]
\[
900 = 1019 - 3x

"Given that \(\triangle ABC\) has an circumcenter \(O\) and an incenter \(I\) with \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the circumradius \(R = 13\), and the inradius \(r = 6\), we need to find \(AB \cdot AC\).

First, recall the relationship between the circumradius \(R\), the inradius \(r\), and the distance \(d\) between the circumcenter and the incenter given by Euler's formula:
\[
d^2 = R(R - 2r).
\]
Substituting the given values \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we get:
\[
d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13.
\]
Thus, \(d = \sqrt{13}\).

Since \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the point \(I\) lies on the circle with diameter \(\overline{OA}\). The length of \(\overline{OA}\) is the circumradius \(R = 13\), so the radius of this circle is \(\frac{13}{2}\). The distance from \(O\) to \(I\) is \(d = \sqrt{13}\), and the distance from \(I\) to the point where \(\overline{OI}\) intersects the circle is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{13}{2}\right)^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2} = \sqrt{\frac{169}{4} - 13} = \sqrt{\frac{169}{4} - \frac{52}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{117}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{117}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{13}}{2}\).

This distance is also equal to the inradius \(r = 6\), so we have:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{13}}{2} = 6 \implies 3\sqrt{13} = 12 \implies \sqrt{13} = 4 \implies 13 = 16,
\]
which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem using another approach.

Using the formula for the area \(K\) of a triangle in terms of its sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and its inradius \(r\):
\[
K = r \cdot s,
\]
where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter, and the area \(K\) can also be expressed as:
\[
K = \frac{abc}{4R},
\]
we equate the two expressions for \(K\):
\[
r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}.
\]
Substituting \(r = 6\) and \(R = 13\), we get:
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52} \implies abc = 312s.
\]
We also know that:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}.
\]
To find \(AB \cdot AC = bc\), we use the fact that in a triangle with \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), the sides \(b\) and \(c\) satisfy the relationship:
\[
bc = 4Rr.
\]
Substituting \(R = 13\) and \(r = 6\), we get:
\[
bc = 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 312.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to this system. Let's consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a, b, c\):
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0.
\]
To find possible values for \(a, b, c\), we can use the fact that \(a, b, c\) must be integers that satisfy both equations. Let's test some possible values for \(a, b, c\).

First, assume \(a = 100\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 200,
\]
\[
100b + 100c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 200 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
100b + 100(200 - b) + b(200 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 200b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
200b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(200 - b) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 200\), and if \(b = 200\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\).

Next, assume \(a = 200\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 100,
\]
\[
200b + 200c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 100 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
200b + 200(100 - b) + b(100 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 100b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
100b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(100 - b) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 100\), and if \(b = 100\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\).

Finally, assume \(a = 0\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 300,
\]
\[
bc = 20,000.
\]
The quadratic equation whose roots are \(b\) and \(c\) is:
\[
t^2 - 300t + 20,000 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\), we get:
\[
t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20,000}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]
So, \(t = 200\) or \(t = 100\). Therefore, the solutions are \((0, 100, 200)\), \((0, 200, 100)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), and \((200, 100, 0)\).

We have already counted these solutions, so the total number of distinct solutions is 6. Therefore, the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) is:

This point \(C\) must be the point where the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length is tangent to the line \(\overline{AB}\). The line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is perpendicular to the radius of the unit circle at the point of tangency.

The distance from the origin \(O\) to the line \(\overline{AB}\) is the length of the perpendicular from \(O\) to \(\overline{AB}\). The formula for the distance from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is:
\[
\text{distance} = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]
Rewriting the equation of \(\overline{AB}\) in the form \(Ax + By + C = 0\), we get:
\[
\sqrt{3}x + y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
\]
The distance from \(O\) to this line is:
\[
\text{distance} = \frac{\left|\sqrt{3}(0) + 1(0) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|}{\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

This distance is the length of the perpendicular from \(O\) to \(\overline{AB}\), which is also the length of the radius of the circle inscribed in the right triangle formed by the x-axis, y-axis, and the line \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(C\) can be found by scaling the coordinates of \(A\) and \(B\) by the ratio of the distance from \(O\) to \(\overline{AB}\) to the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

The length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = 1
\]
The coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[
C = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}, \frac{3}{8}\right)
\]

Finally, we need to find \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64} + \frac{9}{64} = \frac{12}{64} = \frac{3}{16}
\]
Thus, \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), and \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, i.e., \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the 12th degree polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the product becomes \((2-2\cdot1+1^2)\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

Next, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\). This can be done by considering the polynomial \(Q(x) = P(x)P(x^2)P(x^3)\cdots P(x^{12})\). The roots of \(Q(x)\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\), and the constant term of \(Q(x)\) is \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\).

To find the constant term of \(Q(x)\), we evaluate \(Q(0)\):
\[Q(0) = P(0)P(0)P(0)\cdots P(0) = (2-2\cdot0+0^2)^{12} = 2^{12} = 4096.\]

However, we need the product modulo 1000, so we compute \(4096 \mod 1000\):
\[4096 \equiv 96 \pmod{1000}.\]

Thus, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{96}\).","[96, '96']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \ge 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). According to the definition of a \( b \)-beautiful number, we have:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = n \]
Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into the equation, we obtain:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( c \) to be an integer. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]
For \( c \) to be an integer, \( 4ab - 4a + 1 \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \):
\[ 4ab - 4a + 1 = k^2 \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = k^2 - 1 \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (k - 1)(k + 1) \]
Since \( k \) must be odd (because \( k^2 \) is odd), let \( k = 2m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2m + 1 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (2m)(2m + 2) \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = 4m(m + 1) \]
\[ a(b - 1) = m(m + 1) \]
This equation tells us that \( a(b - 1) \) must be the product of two consecutive integers. For each pair \((a, b)\), we can find the corresponding \( c \) and check if it is a valid digit in base \( b \).

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible configurations of the rectangles.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle in this context is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides, where each pair is formed by vertices that are either adjacent or connected by a diagonal.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the possible pairs of vertices:**
   - Each vertex \( A_i \) can be paired with another vertex \( A_j \) such that the line segment \( A_iA_j \) is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.
   - The possible values for \( j \) relative to \( i \) are \( i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4, i+5, i+6 \) (mod 12).

2. **Forming the rectangles:**
   - To form a rectangle, we need to choose two such pairs of vertices such that the pairs are opposite to each other.
   - For example, if we choose \( A_iA_{i+3} \) and \( A_{i+6}A_{i+9} \), these pairs form a rectangle.

3. **Count the number of valid pairs:**
   - For each vertex \( A_i \), there are 6 possible choices for the first pair \( A_iA_{i+k} \) (where \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \)).
   - For each choice of the first pair, there are 5 remaining choices for the second pair (since the second pair must be opposite to the first pair and cannot be the same pair).

4. **Calculate the total number of rectangles:**
   - Since there are 12 vertices, and each vertex can be the starting point of a pair, we initially have \( 12 \times 6 \) choices for the first pair.
   - For each choice of the first pair, there are 5 choices for the second pair, giving us \( 12 \times 6 \times 5 \) choices in total.
   - However, each rectangle is counted twice (once for each pair of opposite sides), so we need to divide by 2.

Thus, the total number of rectangles is:
\[
\frac{12 \times 6 \times 5}{2} = 180
\]

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed is \(\boxed{180}\).","[180, '180']",315,"[315, '315']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to place the digits 0, 1, 8, and 9 into a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column is 99.

First, let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
The two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
From this equation, we can see that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\).

Next, the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]
From this equation, we can see that \(a + b + c = 9\) and \(d + e + f = 9\).

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \(a + d = 9\)
2. \(b + e = 9\)
3. \(c + f = 9\)
4. \(a + b + c = 9\)
5. \(d + e + f = 9\)

From equations 1, 2, and 3, we can express \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 9 - a, \quad e = 9 - b, \quad f = 9 - c
\]
Substituting these into equations 4 and 5, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 9
\]
\[
(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 9 \implies 27 - (a + b + c) = 9 \implies 27 - 9 = 9 \implies 18 = 9
\]
The second equation is always true given the first equation. Therefore, we only need to find the number of solutions to the equation \(a + b + c = 9\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits and \(a, d, b, e, c, f \in \{0, 1, 8, 9\}\).

The possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are 0, 1, 8, and 9. We need to check which combinations of these digits sum to 9:
- \(9 + 0 + 0 = 9\)
- \(8 + 1 + 0 = 9\)
- \(8 + 0 + 1 = 9\)
- \(1 + 8 + 0 = 9\)
- \(1 + 0 + 8 = 9\)
- \(0 + 9 + 0 = 9\)
- \(0 + 8 + 1 = 9\)
- \(0 + 1 + 8 = 9\)
- \(1 + 1 + 7\) (not possible since 7 is not a valid digit)
- \(1 + 8 + 0\) (already counted)
- \(8 + 1 + 0\) (already counted)
- \(9 + 0 + 0\) (already counted)

Thus, the valid combinations are:
- \(9, 0, 0\)
- \(8, 1, 0\)
- \(1, 8, 0\)
- \(1, 0, 8\)
- \(0, 9, 0\)
- \(0, 8, 1\)
- \(0, 1, 8\)

There are 7 valid combinations for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each combination, there is a corresponding combination for \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\):
- If \(a = 9\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 0\), then \(d = 0\), \(e = 9\), \(f = 9\).
- If \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 0\), then \(d = 1\), \(e = 8\), \(f = 9\).
- If \(a = 1\), \(b = 8\), \(c = 0\), then \(d = 8\), \(e = 1\), \(f = 9\).
- If \(a = 1\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 8\), then \(d = 8\), \(e = 9\), \(f = 1\).
- If \(a = 0\), \(b = 9\), \(c = 0\), then \(d = 9\), \(e = 0\), \(f = 9\).
- If \(a = 0\), \(b = 8\), \(c = 1\), then \(d = 9\), \(e = 1\), \(f = 8\).
- If \(a = 0\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 8\), then \(d = 9\), \(e = 8\), \(f = 1\).

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in its exponential form. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations together, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of \(a + b + c\):

\[
a = \frac{1}{2} + b + c
\]
\[
b = \frac{1}{3} + a + c
\]
\[
c = \frac{1}{4} + a + b
\]

Substituting \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) into these equations, we get:

\[
a = \frac{1}{2} + b + c = \frac{1}{2} + \left(-\frac{13}{12} - a\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{13}{12} - a = -\frac{11}{12} - a
\]
\[
2a = -\frac{11}{12}
\]
\[
a = -\frac{11}{24}
\]

\[
b = \frac{1}{3} + a + c = \frac{1}{3} + \left(-\frac{13}{12} - b\right) = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{13}{12} - b = -\frac{9}{12} - b = -\frac{3}{4} - b
\]
\[
2b = -\frac{3}{4}
\]
\[
b = -\frac{3}{8}
\]

\[
c = \frac{1}{4} + a + b = \frac{1}{4} + \left(-\frac{11}{24}\right) + \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{11}{24} - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{6}{24} - \frac{11}{24} - \frac{9}{24} = -\frac{14}{24} = -\frac{7}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{11}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{7}{12}\right) = -\frac{44}{24} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{14}{12} = -\frac{11}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{7}{6} = -\frac{18}{6} - \frac{9}{8} = -3 - \frac{9}{8} = -\frac{24}{8} - \frac{9}{8} = -\frac{33}{8}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is:

\[
\left|-\frac{33}{8}\right| = \frac{33}{8}
\]

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when \( T \) is on the outer side of \( S \) in both cases. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

First, let's find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that generates the torus. This distance is 6 units. The radius of the circle that generates the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the surface of the torus is either \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units (innermost point) or \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units (outermost point).

When the torus is on the outer side of the sphere, the outermost point of the torus is tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to this point is the radius of the sphere, which is 11 units. Therefore, the radius \( r_o \) of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is:
\[
r_o = 11 - 9 = 2
\]

When the torus is on the inner side of the sphere, the innermost point of the torus is tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to this point is the radius of the sphere, which is 11 units. Therefore, the radius \( r_i \) of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is:
\[
r_i = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

The difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 8 - 2 = 6
\]

Thus, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) can be written as \( \frac{6}{1} \), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 25 white and 25 black indistinguishable counters into a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one counter, all counters in the same row and all counters in the same column have the same color, and any additional counter placed on the grid would violate one or more of these conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations for the grid. Each row and each column must be either all white or all black. This means that the entire grid can be divided into a \(5 \times 5\) grid of \(2 \times 2\) blocks, where each block is either all white or all black. However, since the grid is \(5 \times 5\), we can simplify this by considering the grid as a \(5 \times 5\) grid where each row and each column is either all white or all black.

There are two choices for each row: it can be either all white or all black. Since there are 5 rows, there are \(2^5 = 32\) possible ways to assign colors to the rows. Similarly, there are 2 choices for each column: it can be either all white or all black. Since there are 5 columns, there are \(2^5 = 32\) possible ways to assign colors to the columns.

However, we need to ensure that the color of each row is consistent with the color of each column. This means that if a row is all white, then all columns that intersect that row must also be all white, and if a row is all black, then all columns that intersect that row must also be all black. Therefore, the color of each row must be the same as the color of each column.

Thus, there are only 2 possible configurations: either all rows and all columns are all white, or all rows and all columns are all black. In the first configuration, all 25 cells are white, and in the second configuration, all 25 cells are black.

Therefore, the number of ways to place the counters is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",902,"[902, '902']",True
