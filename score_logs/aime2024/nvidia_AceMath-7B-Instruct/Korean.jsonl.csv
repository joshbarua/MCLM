"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the woman to complete her walk to the coffee shop and back, including the time spent at the coffee shop. We will use the information given to set up equations and solve for the unknowns.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( s \) is the woman's initial walking speed in km/h.
- \( t \) is the time spent at the coffee shop in minutes.
- \( d \) is the one-way distance to the coffee shop in km.

The total distance for a round trip is \( 2d \) km. The time taken for the round trip is the sum of the time spent walking and the time spent at the coffee shop.

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the given information

1. When the woman walks at \( s \) km/h:
   - The time taken to walk to the coffee shop and back is \( \frac{2d}{s} \) hours.
   - The total time is \( \frac{2d}{s} \) hours plus \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours (since \( t \) is in minutes).
   - This total time is given as 4 hours.
   \[
   \frac{2d}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]

2. When the woman walks at \( s + 2 \) km/h:
   - The time taken to walk to the coffee shop and back is \( \frac{2d}{s+2} \) hours.
   - The total time is \( \frac{2d}{s+2} \) hours plus \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours.
   - This total time is given as 2 hours 24 minutes, which is \( 2.4 \) hours.
   \[
   \frac{2d}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

First, eliminate \( \frac{t}{60} \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
\left( \frac{2d}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{2d}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 4 - 2.4
\]
\[
\frac{2d}{s} - \frac{2d}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
Factor out \( 2d \) on the left side:
\[
2d \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = 1.6
\]
Combine the fractions inside the parentheses:
\[
2d \left( \frac{(s+2) - s}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
2d \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{4d}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
Solve for \( d \):
\[
4d = 1.6s(s+2)
\]
\[
d = 0.4s(s+2)
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( d \) back into one of the original equations

Substitute \( d = 0.4s(s+2) \) into the first equation:
\[
\frac{2 \cdot 0.4s(s+2)}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{0.8s(s+2)}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
0.8(s+2) + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
0.8s + 1.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
Subtract 1.6 from both sides:
\[
0.8s + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]
Multiply through by 60 to clear the fraction:
\[
48s + t = 144
\]
Solve for \( t \):
\[
t = 144 - 48s
\]

### Step 4: Determine the time when the woman walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h

The time taken to walk to the coffee shop and back is \( \frac{2d}{s + \frac{1}{2}} \) hours, plus \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Substitute \( d = 0.4s(s+2) \) and \( t = 144 - 48s \):
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2 \cdot 0.4s(s+2)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} + \frac{144 - 48s}{60}
\]
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{0.8s(s+2)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} + \frac{144 - 48s}{60}
\]
Simplify the first term:
\[
\frac{0.8s(s+2)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{0.8s(s+2)}{\frac{2s+1}{2}} = \frac{1.6s(s+2)}{2s+1}
\]
Simplify the second term:
\[
\frac{144 - 48s}{60} = 2.4 - 0.8s
\]
Combine the terms:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{1.6s(s+2)}{2s+1} + 2.4 - 0.8s
\]
To find the exact value, we need to determine \( s \). However, we can use the fact that the time is a function of \( s \) and the relationship between \( s \) and \( t \). Since the problem does not provide enough information to solve for \( s \) directly, we can use the fact that the time is a linear function of \( s \) and the given conditions to find the time when \( s = 4 \) km/h (a reasonable assumption based on the problem constraints).

For \( s = 4 \):
\[
t = 144 - 48 \cdot 4 = 144 - 192 = -48 \quad \text{(not possible, so we need to re-evaluate)}
\]

However, the correct approach is to use the relationship between the times and the speed to find the time when \( s = 4 \):
\[
\text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time it takes for the woman to complete her walk to the coffee shop and back, including the time spent at the coffee shop, is \(\boxed{3}\) hours.","[3, '3']",204,"[204, '204']",False
"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of the circle and the tangents to the circle.

First, we note that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, the lengths of the tangents from point \(D\) to the points of tangency on the circle are equal. Let the points of tangency on \(AB\) and \(AC\) be \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. Then, we have:
\[DE = DF.\]

Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), the power of point \(D\) with respect to the circle \(\omega\) is given by:
\[DB^2 = DC^2 = DE \cdot DF.\]

However, we can also use the fact that \(D\) is the excenter of triangle \(ABC\) opposite to vertex \(A\). The length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent from a vertex to the point where the angle bisector intersects the circumcircle. This formula is:
\[AD = \frac{bc}{s},\]
where \(b = AC\), \(c = AB\), and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):
\[s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12.\]

Now, we substitute \(b = 10\), \(c = 5\), and \(s = 12\) into the formula:
\[AD = \frac{10 \cdot 5}{12} = \frac{50}{12} = \frac{25}{6}.\]

Since \(P\) is the point where \(AD\) intersects the circle again, \(AP\) is the length of the segment from \(A\) to \(P\). By the Power of a Point theorem, we have:
\[AP \cdot AD = AB \cdot AC.\]

Substituting the known values:
\[AP \cdot \frac{25}{6} = 5 \cdot 10 = 50.\]

Solving for \(AP\):
\[AP = \frac{50 \cdot 6}{25} = \frac{300}{25} = \frac{12}{1} = 12.\]

Thus, \(AP\) is already in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 12\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 12 + 1 = 13\).

The final answer is:
\[\boxed{13}.\]","[13, '13']",113,"[113, '113']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that after rotating a regular octagon, all the blue vertices will be in the positions originally occupied by red vertices. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of colorings:**
   Each vertex of the octagon can be either red or blue, and there are 8 vertices. Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:
   \[
   2^8 = 256
   \]

2. **Determine the number of favorable colorings:**
   A coloring is favorable if there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all blue vertices are in the positions originally occupied by red vertices. This means that the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the set of red vertices after some rotation.

   Let's consider the possible configurations of blue vertices:
   - If there are no blue vertices, then the condition is trivially satisfied.
   - If there is exactly one blue vertex, then the condition is satisfied if the blue vertex is in a position originally occupied by a red vertex after some rotation. This is always true because rotating the octagon will map the blue vertex to any of the 8 positions.
   - If there are exactly two blue vertices, then the condition is satisfied if the set of blue vertices is a subset of the set of red vertices after some rotation. This is true if the two blue vertices are not adjacent (since rotating the octagon will map them to any pair of non-adjacent positions).
   - If there are exactly three blue vertices, then the condition is satisfied if the set of blue vertices is a subset of the set of red vertices after some rotation. This is true if the three blue vertices are not all adjacent (since rotating the octagon will map them to any set of three non-adjacent positions).
   - If there are exactly four blue vertices, then the condition is satisfied if the set of blue vertices is a subset of the set of red vertices after some rotation. This is true if the four blue vertices are not all adjacent (since rotating the octagon will map them to any set of four non-adjacent positions).

   We can generalize this pattern. The number of favorable colorings is the number of subsets of the set of red vertices that are invariant under some rotation of the octagon.

3. **Calculate the number of favorable colorings:**
   The number of favorable colorings is the sum of the number of subsets of the set of red vertices that are invariant under some rotation of the octagon. This is a well-known problem in combinatorial group theory, and the answer is given by the formula:
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \left( 2^8 + 2^4 + 2^4 + 2^4 + 2^4 + 2^4 + 2^4 + 2^4 \right) = \frac{1}{8} \left( 256 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 \right) = \frac{1}{8} \left( 320 \right) = 40
   \]

4. **Determine the probability:**
   The probability that after rotating the octagon, all the blue vertices will be in the positions originally occupied by red vertices is the ratio of the number of favorable colorings to the total number of colorings:
   \[
   \frac{40}{256} = \frac{5}{32}
   \]

5. **Find \( m + n \):**
   Here, \( m = 5 \) and \( n = 32 \), so \( m + n = 5 + 32 = 37 \).

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{37}

"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( |x| < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).

Thus, \( f(x) \) is a piecewise linear function that is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( |x| < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).

Thus, \( g(x) \) is a piecewise linear function that is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is a periodic function with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is a periodic function with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 5: Determine the intersection points
The graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are both periodic and symmetric. To find the number of intersection points, we need to consider the behavior of these functions over one period.

Since both functions are periodic and symmetric, and they both range from 0 to 1, they will intersect at multiple points within each period. Specifically, each period of \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will intersect the graph \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) at 6 points (3 positive and 3 negative).

Given that the period of \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) is \(\frac{2}{3}\), and the period of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) is 1, the graphs will intersect at 6 points in each period of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \).

Thus, the total number of intersection points is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]","[6, '6']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, we need to find a factorization over the integers. We can use the Sophie Germain identity:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1).
\]
We need to find a prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Let's check the smallest primes.

For \( p = 2 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2},
\]
so \( 2^2 = 4 \) does not divide \( n^4 + 1 \) for any \( n \).

For \( p = 3 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{3}.
\]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 3:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
So, \( 3^2 = 9 \) does not divide \( n^4 + 1 \) for any \( n \).

For \( p = 5 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{5}.
\]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
So, \( 5^2 = 25 \) does not divide \( n^4 + 1 \) for any \( n \).

For \( p = 17 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{17}.
\]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 17:
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \).
- If \( n \equiv 13 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 13^4 + 1 \equiv 28561 + 1 \equiv 28562 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \).
So, \( 17^2 = 289 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for \( n = 4 \) and \( n = 13 \).

Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) for some positive integer \( n \) is \( p = 17 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \). From the above, we know that \( m = 4 \) and \( m = 13 \) are solutions. The smallest positive integer \( m \) is \( m = 4 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangular box as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area of the box is given by:

\[2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\]

The volume of the box is given by:

\[abc = 23\]

Since 23 is a prime number, the only possible integer values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are 1, 1, and 23. We can verify this by substituting these values into the surface area equation:

\[2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 23 + 23 \cdot 1) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 2 \cdot 47 = 94\]

However, this does not satisfy the surface area condition. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that the dimensions are not all integers. Instead, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The radius \(r\) of the sphere is half the length of the space diagonal of the box, which is given by:

\[r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}\]

We need to minimize \(r^2\), which is:

\[r^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4}\]

From the surface area equation, we have:

\[ab + bc + ca = 27\]

We also have the volume equation:

\[abc = 23\]

To find the minimum value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or symmetry arguments. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of squares is minimized when the variables are as close to each other as possible. Let's assume \(a = b\) and solve for \(c\):

\[a^2 + ac + ac = 27 \implies a^2 + 2ac = 27\]
\[a^3c = 23 \implies c = \frac{23}{a^3}\]

Substituting \(c\) into the surface area equation:

\[a^2 + 2a \cdot \frac{23}{a^3} = 27 \implies a^2 + \frac{46}{a^2} = 27\]

Let \(x = a^2\). Then the equation becomes:

\[x + \frac{46}{x} = 27 \implies x^2 - 27x + 46 = 0\]

Solving this quadratic equation:

\[x = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{729 - 184}}{2} = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{545}}{2}\]

Since \(x = a^2\) must be a positive number, we take the positive root:

\[x = \frac{27 + \sqrt{545}}{2}\]

However, this is not a simple solution. Instead, we can use the fact that the minimum value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) occurs when \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are as close to each other as possible. By trial and error or numerical methods, we find that the minimum value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) is 27 when \(a = 3\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = \frac{23}{9}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(r^2\) is:

\[r^2 = \frac{27}{4}\]

The values of \(p\) and \(q\) are 27 and 4, respectively. Therefore, \(p + q = 27 + 4 = 31\).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x\left(y^x\right) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
y^x = x^{10}
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
x^{4y} = y^{10}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(y^x) = \ln(x^{10})

\[
x \ln y = 10 \ln x

\[
\frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}

Now, for the second equation:

\[
\ln(x^{4y}) = \ln(y^{10})

\[
4y \ln x = 10 \ln y

\[

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and Bar's strategy guarantees a win regardless of Alice's moves, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions.

### Step 1: Identify the Base Cases
First, let's identify the base cases for small values of \( n \):
- \( n = 1 \): Alice wins by taking the only token.
- \( n = 2 \): Alice wins by taking one token, leaving one for Bob.
- \( n = 3 \): Alice wins by taking one token, leaving two for Bob.
- \( n = 4 \): Alice wins by taking all four tokens.
- \( n = 5 \): Alice wins by taking one token, leaving four for Bob.
- \( n = 6 \): Alice wins by taking one token, leaving five for Bob.
- \( n = 7 \): Alice wins by taking one token, leaving six for Bob.
- \( n = 8 \): Alice wins by taking four tokens, leaving four for Bob.

From these base cases, we see that \( n = 9 \) is a losing position because no matter how Alice plays, Bob can always leave Alice with a winning position:
- If Alice takes 1 token, Bob leaves 8 tokens (winning for Bob).
- If Alice takes 4 tokens, Bob leaves 5 tokens (winning for Bob).

### Step 2: Generalize the Pattern
We observe that \( n = 9 \) is a losing position. Let's check the next few values:
- \( n = 10 \): Alice wins by taking 1 token, leaving 9 for Bob.
- \( n = 11 \): Alice wins by taking 1 token, leaving 10 for Bob.
- \( n = 12 \): Alice wins by taking 4 tokens, leaving 8 for Bob.
- \( n = 13 \): Alice wins by taking 1 token, leaving 12 for Bob.
- \( n = 14 \): Alice wins by taking 1 token, leaving 13 for Bob.
- \( n = 15 \): Alice wins by taking 1 token, leaving 14 for Bob.
- \( n = 16 \): Alice wins by taking 4 tokens, leaving 12 for Bob.

From this, we see that \( n = 17 \) is a losing position:
- If Alice takes 1 token, Bob leaves 16 tokens (winning for Bob).
- If Alice takes 4 tokens, Bob leaves 13 tokens (winning for Bob).

### Step 3: Identify the Pattern
We can generalize that \( n \) is a losing position if \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \). This is because:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), Alice can always take 4 tokens, leaving \( n-4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) (winning for Bob).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), Alice can always take 1 token, leaving \( n-1 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) (winning for Bob).

### Step 4: Count the Losing Positions
We need to count the number of integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).

- The number of integers \( n \leq 2024 \) such that \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).
- The number of integers \( n \leq 2024 \) such that \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024-4}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has already won the prize. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins the prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the grand prize.

We are given that Jen wins the prize, so we need to find the conditional probability \( P(B \mid A) \). By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \]

Since winning the grand prize implies winning the prize, \( B \cap A = B \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Next, we need to calculate \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(A) \)
Jen wins the prize if at least two of her chosen numbers match the four numbers drawn from \( S \). The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is:
\[ \binom{10}{4} = 210 \]

The number of ways Jen does not win the prize is if she matches 0 or 1 number with the drawn numbers.

#### Case 1: Jen matches 0 numbers
Jen chooses 4 numbers from the 6 numbers that are not drawn. The number of ways to do this is:
\[ \binom{6}{4} = 15 \]

#### Case 2: Jen matches 1 number
Jen chooses 1 number from the 4 drawn numbers and 3 numbers from the 6 not drawn numbers. The number of ways to do this is:
\[ \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

The total number of ways Jen does not win the prize is:
\[ 15 + 80 = 95 \]

Therefore, the number of ways Jen wins the prize is:
\[ 210 - 95 = 115 \]

The probability that Jen wins the prize is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(B) \)
Jen wins the grand prize if all four of her chosen numbers match the four numbers drawn. The number of ways this can happen is:
\[ \binom{4}{4} = 1 \]

The probability that Jen wins the grand prize is:
\[ P(B) = \frac{1}{210} \]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(B \mid A) \)
Now we can find the conditional probability:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{5 \times 23} = \frac{1}{115} \]

The probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has already won the prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), so \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{116} \]","[116, '116']",116,"[116, '116']",True
"To find the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the shapes involved.

First, we note that \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles, and points \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear. Additionally, points \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(G\) lie on a circle. This implies that quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic.

Given the dimensions of the rectangles:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

We can find the lengths of the other sides of the rectangles:
- \(CD = AB = 107\)
- \(DA = BC = 16\)
- \(GH = EF = 184\)
- \(EH = FG = 17\)

Since \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear, the length \(CE\) can be found by considering the relative positions of these points. Specifically, \(CE\) is the sum of \(CD\) and \(DE\).

To find \(DE\), we use the fact that \(ADHG\) is cyclic. The power of a point theorem (also known as the Power of a Point Theorem for a point outside a circle) states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one secant line through \(D\) are equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of another secant line through \(D\).

In this case, the secant lines are \(DA\) and \(DG\), and the segments are \(DA\) and \(DG\) for one secant, and \(DH\) and \(DG\) for the other secant. However, since \(D\) is a vertex of the rectangle \(ABCD\) and \(H\) is a vertex of the rectangle \(EFGH\), and both rectangles share the same circle, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral formed by the vertices of the rectangles will intersect at a point that divides the diagonals in a specific ratio.

Given the dimensions, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the diagonals:
- The diagonal \(AC\) of rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
  \[
  AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 256} = \sqrt{11705}
  \]
- The diagonal \(EG\) of rectangle \(EFGH\) is:
  \[
  EG = \sqrt{EF^2 + EH^2} = \sqrt{184^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{33856 + 289} = \sqrt{34145}
  \]

Since \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear, the length \(CE\) is the sum of \(CD\) and \(DE\). However, we need to find \(DE\) using the properties of the cyclic quadrilateral. The exact calculation of \(DE\) involves more complex geometric relationships, but we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides of the rectangles and the collinearity of the points give us the length of \(CE\).

Given the problem constraints and the properties of the shapes, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To find the number of paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Path Representation**: Each path can be represented as a sequence of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. The total number of paths without any restrictions is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\), which represents the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's in a sequence of 16 moves.

2. **Direction Changes**: A direction change occurs when a right move is followed by an up move or an up move is followed by a right move. To have exactly four direction changes, we need to place four pairs of consecutive moves that are different. This means we need to place four R's and four U's such that no two consecutive R's or U's are next to each other.

3. **Counting Valid Sequences**: To count the number of valid sequences, we can use a combinatorial approach. We need to place 8 R's and 8 U's in a sequence such that no two consecutive R's or U's are next to each other. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's in a sequence where no two consecutive elements are the same.

4. **Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid sequences. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the number of valid sequences is given by the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's such that no two consecutive elements are the same. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and the solution is given by the formula for the number of alternating permutations of 8 R's and 8 U's.

5. **Final Answer**: The number of valid sequences is given by the formula for the number of alternating permutations of 8 R's and 8 U's, which is \(\binom{8}{4} \times 2^8\).

"To find the maximum real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) given that \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use the Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these in, we have:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we get:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
\]

Combining like terms, the real part of the expression is:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

We need to maximize the function \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This can be written in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\) and \(\tan\phi = \frac{432}{324} = \frac{4}{3}\).

Calculating \(R\), we get:

R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) given that the triangle is circumscribed by a circle with radius 34 and two of its sides are tangent to two circles with radius 1. We will use the properties of the incircle and the given geometric configuration to find the solution.

First, let's denote the radius of the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) as \(r\). The incircle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle, and the radius of the incircle is the distance from the incenter to any of the sides of the triangle.

Given that the radius of the circumscribed circle is 34 and two of the sides of the triangle are tangent to two circles with radius 1, we can use the fact that the distance from the incenter to a side of the triangle is the radius of the incircle, and the distance from the incenter to the point of tangency of the two smaller circles is the radius of the incircle plus the radius of the smaller circles.

The key insight here is that the distance from the incenter to the point of tangency of the two smaller circles is the radius of the incircle plus 1. This distance is also equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle minus the radius of the incircle. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ r + 1 = 34 - r \]

Solving for \(r\), we get:

\[ 2r + 1 = 34 \]
\[ 2r = 33 \]
\[ r = \frac{33}{2} \]

The radius of the incircle is \(\frac{33}{2}\). Since 33 and 2 are coprime, the radius is in its simplest form. The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the radius when expressed as a fraction in simplest form. Therefore, we have:

\[ m = 33 \]
\[ n = 2 \]
\[ m + n = 33 + 2 = 35 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus. The hyperbola is given by:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

The asymptotes of this hyperbola are given by the equations:

\[
y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{24}{20}} x = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5} x
\]

Since the rhombus \(ABCD\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, the vertices \(A, B, C, D\) can be represented as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\) respectively. The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2y_1\) and the length of the diagonal \(AC\) is \(2x_1\).

The area of the rhombus can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x_1 \times 2y_1 = 2x_1 y_1
\]

Since the points \(A, B, C, D\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation of the hyperbola:

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2 = (2y_1)^2 = 4y_1^2\) under the constraint of the hyperbola equation. To do this, we express \(x_1^2\) in terms of \(y_1^2\):

\[
x_1^2 = 20 \left(1 + \frac{y_1^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{5y_1^2}{6}
\]

The area of the rhombus can also be expressed in terms of \(y_1\) using the relationship between \(x_1\) and \(y_1\):

\[
2x_1 y_1 = 2 \sqrt{20 + \frac{5y_1^2}{6}} y_1
\]

However, we are interested in the maximum value of \(4y_1^2\). To find this, we use the fact that the area of the rhombus is maximized when the diagonals are perpendicular to each other, which is always true for a rhombus inscribed in a hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The maximum value of \(y_1^2\) occurs when the hyperbola is at its asymptotes, but since the hyperbola does not reach its asymptotes, we consider the behavior as \(y_1\) approaches the values that satisfy the hyperbola equation.

The maximum value of \(y_1^2\) can be found by considering the relationship between \(x_1\) and \(y_1\) and the fact that the hyperbola is symmetric. The maximum value of \(y_1^2\) is when \(x_1\) is at its minimum value, which is when \(x_1 = 0\):

\[
\frac{0^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies -\frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies y_1^2 = -24
\]

However, this is not possible since \(y_1^2\) must be positive. Therefore, we consider the maximum value of \(y_1^2\) as it approaches the asymptotes, which is when \(y_1^2\) is maximized under the hyperbola equation. The maximum value of \(y_1^2\) is when \(x_1\) is at its minimum value, which is when \(x_1 = 0\):

\[
\frac{0^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies -\frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \implies y_1^2 = 24
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \(4y_1^2\) is:

\[
4 \times 24 = 96

"To determine the number of Aimeville residents who own all four items (diamond rings, golf club sets, wine glasses, and wallets), we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( D \) be the set of residents who own diamond rings.
- Let \( G \) be the set of residents who own golf club sets.
- Let \( W \) be the set of residents who own wine glasses.
- Let \( A \) be the set of residents who own wallets.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of residents is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of residents who own diamond rings is \( |D| = 195 \).
- The number of residents who own golf club sets is \( |G| = 367 \).
- The number of residents who own wine glasses is \( |W| = 562 \).
- The number of residents who own wallets is \( |A| = 900 \) (since every resident owns a wallet).
- The number of residents who own exactly two items is 437.
- The number of residents who own exactly three items is 234.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, which is \( |D \cap G \cap W \cap A| \).

First, let's use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets to express the total number of residents who own at least one item:
\[
|D \cup G \cup W \cup A| = |D| + |G| + |W| + |A| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap W| - |D \cap A| - |G \cap W| - |G \cap A| - |W \cap A| + |D \cap G \cap W| + |D \cap G \cap A| + |D \cap W \cap A| + |G \cap W \cap A| - |D \cap G \cap W \cap A|
\]
Since every resident owns a wallet, \( |D \cup G \cup W \cup A| = 900 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - |D \cap G| - |D \cap W| - |D \cap A| - |G \cap W| - |G \cap A| - |W \cap A| + |D \cap G \cap W| + |D \cap G \cap A| + |D \cap W \cap A| + |G \cap W \cap A| - |D \cap G \cap W \cap A|
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
900 = 1924 - (|D \cap G| + |D \cap W| + |D \cap A| + |G \cap W| + |G \cap A| + |W \cap A|) + (|D \cap G \cap W| + |D \cap G \cap A| + |D \cap W \cap A| + |G \cap W \cap A|) - |D \cap G \cap W \cap A|
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
|D \cap G \cap W \cap A| = 1924 - 900 - (|D \cap G| + |D \cap W| + |D \cap A| + |G \cap W| + |G \cap A| + |W \cap A|) + (|D \cap G \cap W| + |D \cap G \cap A| + |D \cap W \cap A| + |G \cap W \cap A|)
\]
\[
|D \cap G \cap W \cap A| = 1024 - (|D \cap G| + |D \cap W| + |D \cap A| + |G \cap W| + |G \cap A| + |W \cap A|) + (|D \cap G \cap W| + |D \cap G \cap A| + |D \cap W \cap A| + |G \cap W \cap A|)
\]

Next, we use the information about the number of residents who own exactly two and exactly three items. The number of residents who own exactly two items is the sum of the pairwise intersections minus three times the number of residents who own all four items:
\[
|D \cap G| + |D \cap W| + |D \cap A| + |G \cap W| + |G \cap A| + |W \cap A| - 3|D \cap G \cap W \cap A| = 437
\]
The number of residents who own exactly three items is the sum of the triple intersections minus three times the number of residents who own all four items:
\[
|D \cap G \cap W| + |D \cap G \cap A| + |D \cap W \cap A| + |G \cap W \cap A| - 3|D \cap G \cap W \cap A| = 234
\]

Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
|D \cap G \cap W \cap A| = 1024 - (437 + 3|D \cap G \cap W \cap A|) + (234 + 3|D \cap G \cap W \cap A|)
\]
\[
|D \cap G \cap W \cap A| = 1024 - 437 + 234

"To solve for \( AB \cdot AC \) in \(\triangle ABC\) given that the circumradius \( R = 13 \), the inradius \( r = 6 \), and the condition \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\), we can use properties of the triangle's circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \).

First, recall that the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle can be expressed as:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Given \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we substitute these values into the formula:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Next, we use the condition \(\overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI}\). This implies that \( A \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OI \). The radius of this circle is:
\[
\frac{OI}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{2}
\]

Now, consider the power of point \( A \) with respect to the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\). The power of point \( A \) is given by:
\[
\text{Power of } A = AI \cdot AI = AI^2
\]
Since \( A \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OI \), the power of \( A \) is also equal to the square of the radius of this circle:
\[
AI^2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{13}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{13}{4}
\]

We also know that the length \( AI \) can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle and the inradius \( r \):
\[
AI^2 = \frac{bc(s-a)}{s}
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the sides opposite vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), respectively. However, we can use another relationship involving the circumradius \( R \) and the sides of the triangle:
\[
AI^2 = R(R - 2r) + 2Rr \cos A
\]
Given that \( OI \perp AI \), we have \( \cos A = 0 \), so the equation simplifies to:
\[
AI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13
\]
This is consistent with our earlier calculation.

Finally, we use the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the circumradius:
\[
bc = 4R \Delta
\]
where \( \Delta \) is the area of the triangle. The area \( \Delta \) can also be expressed as:
\[
\Delta = sr

Substituting \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:

\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 \]

First, we can rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form. Notice that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) - 3abc \]

Substituting \( a + b + c = 300 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 \]

Dividing the entire equation by 3, we have:
\[ 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000 \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ 100bc = 100(100(200) + bc) - 2,000,000 \]
\[ 100bc = 20,000,000 + 100bc - 2,000,000 \]
\[ 0 = 18,000,000 \]

This is a contradiction, so \(a = 100\) is not a valid solution.

### Case 3: \(a = 100\)
If \(a = 100\), then \(b + c = 200\). Substituting \(a = 100\) into the equation, we get:
\[ 100bc = 100(100b + 100c + bc) - 2,000,000 \]
\[ 100bc = 100(100(200) + bc) - 2,000,000 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\) are \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line passing through these points is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Next, we need to find the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) such that \(C\) is not on any line segment in \(\mathcal{F}\). A line segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) has one endpoint on the \(x\)-axis and the other on the \(y\)-axis, and its length is 1. The equation of such a line segment can be written as:
\[
\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \quad \text{with} \quad a^2 + b^2 = 1
\]
We need to find the point \(C = (x, y)\) on the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) that does not satisfy any such equation. To do this, we substitute \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the line equation:
\[
\frac{x}{a} + \frac{-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{b} = 1
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x}{a} - \frac{\sqrt{3}x}{b} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2b} = 1 \implies x\left(\frac{1}{a} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{b}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2b} = 1
\]
For \(C\) to not lie on any such line, the coefficient of \(x\) must be zero and the constant term must not equal 1:
\[
\frac{1}{a} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{b} = 0 \implies b = \sqrt{3}a
\]
Substituting \(b = \sqrt{3}a\) into \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\):
\[
a^2 + (\sqrt{3}a)^2 = 1 \implies a^2 + 3a^2 = 1 \implies 4a^2 = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus, \(b = \sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). The line equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x}{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{y}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 1 \implies 2x + \frac{2y}{\sqrt{3}} = 1 \implies 2x + \frac{2y}{\sqrt{3}} = 1
\]
Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into this equation:
\[
2x + \frac{2(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})}{\sqrt{3}} = 1 \implies 2x - 2x + 1 = 1 \implies 1 = 1
\]
This is an identity, so we need to find the point where the line \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) intersects the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\):
\[
x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4 \implies 16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
The corresponding \(y\)-coordinates are:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{-3\sqrt{3} \mp \sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \mp \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]
The point \(C\) that is not on any line segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) is the one with the positive \(x\)-coordinate:
\[
C = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)
\]
Finally, we calculate \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2}{64} = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{13} + 13 + 3 - 6\sqrt{39} + 39}{64} = \frac{64}{64} = 1
\]
Thus, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 1\), so \(p + q = 2\). The answer is:

"To find the value of \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity (i.e., \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\)), we start by considering the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity. This polynomial is given by \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:

\[
x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1).
\]

The roots of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\) are the 13th roots of unity except 1, which are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that when \(k=0\), the term is \(2-2\omega^0 + \omega^0 = 2-2+1 = 1\). Therefore, the product simplifies to:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}).
\]

Next, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the value of the product \(P(\omega)P(\omega^2)\cdots P(\omega^{12})\). This product can be expressed as the resultant of the polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\).

The resultant of two polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) can be found using the determinant of their Sylvester matrix. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial evaluated at the roots of another polynomial can be found using the constant term of the polynomial obtained by substituting the roots of the second polynomial into the first polynomial.

In this case, we can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial \(P(x)\) evaluated at the roots of a polynomial \(Q(x)\) is given by \((-1)^{\deg(P)\deg(Q)}\) times the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(P(x))\) divided by the leading coefficient of \(Q(x)\).

First, we find \(P(x)^{12} + P(x)^{11} + \cdots + P(x) + 1\). The constant term of this polynomial is \(P(0)^{12} + P(0)^{11} + \cdots + P(0) + 1 = 2^{12} + 2^{11} + \cdots + 2 + 1 = 2^{13} - 1 = 8191\).

Since the leading coefficient of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) is 1, the product is simply the constant term of \(P(x)^{12} + P(x)^{11} + \cdots + P(x) + 1\), which is 8191.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 8191 is divided by 1000. We have:

\[
8191 \div 1000 = 8 \text{ remainder } 191.

Therefore, the remainder when 8191 is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{191}\).","[191, '191']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To find the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there are at least 10 \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the conditions for a number \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it can be expressed as a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = n \]
Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into the equation, we have:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( c \) to be an integer. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]

So, for \( b = 14 \), there is only one \( b \)-beautiful number, which is \( 625 \) (since \( 625 = 25^2 \) and \( 25 = 12 + 13 \)).

"To determine the number of rectangles in a fixed regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible configurations of the rectangles.

A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. A rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides. In a dodecagon, each pair of opposite sides can be chosen in such a way that the sides are either sides of the dodecagon or diagonals.

First, let's count the number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite sides. Each pair of opposite sides corresponds to a unique rectangle. We can choose the first pair of opposite sides in 12 ways (since there are 12 vertices, and each vertex can be the starting point of a side). Once the first pair is chosen, the second pair is uniquely determined as the pair of sides opposite to the first pair.

However, since the order in which we choose the pairs does not matter, we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. Therefore, the number of rectangles is:

\[
\frac{12 \times 12}{2} = 72
\]

Thus, the number of rectangles in a fixed regular dodecagon where each side is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions and then find the sum of the squares of its elements.

### Step 1: Determine the number of elements in the list
Let the list have \( n \) elements. The sum of the elements is 30, so we have:
\[ a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 30. \]

### Step 2: Identify the mode and median
The mode of the list is 9, which means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list. The median is a number that does not appear in the list and is the middle value when the list is sorted. If \( n \) is odd, the median is the \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\)-th element in the sorted list. If \( n \) is even, the median is the average of the \(\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\)-th and \(\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)\)-th elements in the sorted list.

### Step 3: Construct the list
To satisfy the conditions, let's start with the mode being 9. If 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's assume it appears \( k \) times, where \( k \geq 2 \). The sum of the elements is 30, so the sum of the remaining \( n-k \) elements is \( 30 - 9k \).

The median must be a number that does not appear in the list. If \( n \) is odd, the median is the middle element, and if \( n \) is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. To ensure the median is not in the list, we need to carefully choose the elements.

Let's try \( n = 5 \). If \( n = 5 \), the median is the third element in the sorted list. To ensure the median is not 9, we can have the list in the form \( [a, b, c, d, e] \) where \( c \) is the median and \( c \neq 9 \). Let's assume \( k = 2 \), so the list has two 9's. The sum of the remaining three elements is \( 30 - 18 = 12 \). We can choose the elements such that the median is not 9. For example, the list could be \( [1, 9, 9, 10, 1] \). The median is 9, which is not in the list.

However, this list does not satisfy the condition that the median is a number that does not appear in the list. Let's try another approach.

Let's try \( n = 6 \). If \( n = 6 \), the median is the average of the third and fourth elements in the sorted list. To ensure the median is not 9, we can have the list in the form \( [a, b, c, d, e, f] \) where \( \frac{c + d}{2} \) is the median and \( c \neq 9 \) and \( d \neq 9 \). Let's assume \( k = 2 \), so the list has two 9's. The sum of the remaining four elements is \( 30 - 18 = 12 \). We can choose the elements such that the median is not 9. For example, the list could be \( [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 9] \). The median is \( \frac{3 + 4}{2} = 3.5 \), which is not in the list.

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the squares of the elements
The list is \( [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 9] \). The sum of the squares of the elements is:
\[ 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 81 + 81 = 192. \]

Thus, the sum of the squares of the elements is:
\[ \boxed{192}. \]","[192, '192']",236,"[236, '236']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the digits read from left to right in each row is 999, and the sum of the digits read from top to bottom in each column is 99.

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
From the problem, we have the following conditions:
1. The sum of the digits in the first row is 999: \(a + b + c = 999\).
2. The sum of the digits in the second row is 999: \(d + e + f = 999\).
3. The sum of the digits in the first column is 99: \(a + d = 99\).
4. The sum of the digits in the second column is 99: \(b + e = 99\).
5. The sum of the digits in the third column is 99: \(c + f = 99\).

We can express \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 99 - a, \quad e = 99 - b, \quad f = 99 - c.
\]
Substituting these into the row sum conditions, we get:
\[
d + e + f = (99 - a) + (99 - b) + (99 - c) = 297 - (a + b + c).
\]
Since \(d + e + f = 999\), we have:
\[
297 - (a + b + c) = 999 \implies a + b + c = -702.
\]
However, this is impossible because \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0 through 9), and their sum cannot be negative. Therefore, there are no valid ways to fill the grid that satisfy all the given conditions.

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the equations. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:

\[
39 + 4 = 43

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) and the set \( B \). The set \( B \) is a subset of the set of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is an element of \( A \). Since there are 2024 such sets \( B \), we need to determine the number of elements in \( A \) and their values.

First, let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). The set \( B \) can be any non-empty subset of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_n\} \) such that the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). This means that for each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the set \( B \) can be any non-empty subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i\} \) that includes \( a_i \).

The number of such subsets for each \( a_i \) is \( 2^{a_i} - 1 \) (since there are \( 2^{a_i} \) subsets of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i\} \) and we exclude the empty subset). Therefore, the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{a_i} - 1 \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).

Given that the total number of sets \( B \) is 2024, we have:
\[
(2^{a_1} - 1) + (2^{a_2} - 1) + \cdots + (2^{a_n} - 1) = 2024
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} + \cdots + 2^{a_n} - n = 2024
\]
\[
2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} + \cdots + 2^{a_n} = 2024 + n
\]

To find the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), we need to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. The binary representation of 2024 is:
\[
2024_{10} = 11111101000_2
\]
This means:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]
So, \( a_1 = 3, a_2 = 5, a_3 = 7, a_4 = 8, a_5 = 6, a_6 = 9, a_7 = 10 \). The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[

Therefore, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) when \( T \) is inside and outside \( S \), respectively. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle, and the sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Step 1: Determine the radius \( r_i \) when the torus is inside the sphere
When the torus is inside the sphere, the inner circle of the torus is tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the inner circle of the torus is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units. The radius of the inner circle of the torus is the distance from the center of the inner circle to the surface of the torus, which is 3 units. Therefore, the radius \( r_i \) of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is:
\[
r_i = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

### Step 2: Determine the radius \( r_o \) when the torus is outside the sphere
When the torus is outside the sphere, the outer circle of the torus is tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the outer circle of the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units. The radius of the outer circle of the torus is the distance from the center of the outer circle to the surface of the torus, which is 3 units. Therefore, the radius \( r_o \) of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is:
\[
r_o = 11 + 3 = 14
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6
\]
However, since we are asked for the positive difference, we take the absolute value:
\[
|r_i - r_o| = 6
\]

### Step 4: Express the difference as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) and find \( m + n \)
The difference \( 6 \) can be written as the fraction \(\frac{6}{1}\), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 6 + 1 = 7
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 25 white and 25 black chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly 5 chips, and each row and each column contains chips of the same color. Additionally, no two chips of the same color can be in the same row or column.

This problem can be translated into finding the number of ways to arrange 5 rows and 5 columns such that each row and each column contains exactly one white chip and one black chip, and no two chips of the same color are in the same row or column. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to pair the rows with the columns such that each row is paired with a unique column.

This is a classic problem in combinatorics, and the solution is given by the number of permutations of 5 elements. The number of permutations of 5 elements is \(5!\).

Therefore, the number of ways to place the chips is:
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",902,"[902, '902']",False
