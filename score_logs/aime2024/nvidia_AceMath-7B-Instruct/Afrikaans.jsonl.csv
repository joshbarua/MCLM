"To determine the total time Aya takes to complete the 9-kilometer hike and stop at the coffee shop, we need to first find the value of \( s \) and \( t \).

Given:
1. When Aya hikes at \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When Aya hikes at \( s+2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.

First, let's convert the total times into hours:
- 4 hours is already in hours.
- 2 hours and 24 minutes is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours.

The time spent hiking is the total time minus the time spent in the coffee shop. Let \( T_h \) be the hiking time in hours. Then:
- For the first scenario: \( T_h = 4 - \frac{t}{60} \)
- For the second scenario: \( T_h = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \)

The distance hiked is 9 km. Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \), we can write:
- For the first scenario: \( 9 = s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) \)
- For the second scenario: \( 9 = (s+2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) \)

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( 9 = s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) \)
2. \( 9 = (s+2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right) \)

Let's expand and simplify these equations:
1. \( 9 = 4s - \frac{st}{60} \)
2. \( 9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60} \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ 0 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{2t}{60} - 4s \]
\[ 0 = -1.6s + 4.8 - \frac{2t}{60} \]
\[ 1.6s - 4.8 = -\frac{2t}{60} \]
\[ 1.6s - 4.8 = -\frac{t}{30} \]
\[ t = 30(4.8 - 1.6s) \]
\[ t = 144 - 48s \]

Now substitute \( t = 144 - 48s \) back into the first equation:
\[ 9 = 4s - \frac{s(144 - 48s)}{60} \]
\[ 9 = 4s - \frac{144s - 48s^2}{60} \]
\[ 9 = 4s - \frac{144s}{60} + \frac{48s^2}{60} \]
\[ 9 = 4s - 2.4s + 0.8s^2 \]
\[ 9 = 1.6s + 0.8s^2 \]
\[ 0.8s^2 + 1.6s - 9 = 0 \]
\[ 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0 \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -45 \):
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-45)}}{2 \cdot 4} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8} \]
\[ s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8} \]
\[ s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \quad \text{(since speed cannot be negative)} \]

Now substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the equation for \( t \):
\[ t = 144 - 48 \cdot 2.5 \]
\[ t = 144 - 120 \]
\[ t = 24 \]

Finally, we need to find the total time Aya takes to hike at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h:
\[ T_h = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 + \frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 3.4 \times 60 = 204 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Aya takes to complete the hike and stop at the coffee shop is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.","[204, '204']",204,"[204, '204']",True
"To solve for \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of the circle and the tangents. The tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so \(BD = BP\) and \(CD = CP\).

Given the side lengths \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we can use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the power of the point is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant line and also equal to the square of the length of the tangent from the point to the circle. Here, \(D\) is the point where the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\) meet, and \(AD\) is a secant line intersecting the circle at \(A\) and \(P\).

The Power of a Point theorem gives us:
\[
BD^2 = AD \cdot PD
\]
Since \(BD = BP\) and \(CD = CP\), we can also write:
\[
BD^2 = AD \cdot (AD - AP)
\]
First, we need to find \(BD\). Using the fact that \(BD = BP\) and the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\) to the circle, we have:
\[
BD = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{AB + AC} = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{5 + 10} = \frac{50}{15} = \frac{10}{3}
\]
Now, we substitute \(BD = \frac{10}{3}\) into the Power of a Point theorem:
\[
\left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2 = AD \cdot (AD - AP)
\]
\[
\frac{100}{9} = AD \cdot (AD - AP)
\]
Next, we need to find \(AD\). Using the fact that \(AD\) is the sum of the segments \(AB\) and \(BD\):
\[
AD = AB + BD = 5 + \frac{10}{3} = \frac{15}{3} + \frac{10}{3} = \frac{25}{3}
\]
Now substitute \(AD = \frac{25}{3}\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{100}{9} = \frac{25}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{25}{3} - AP\right)
\]
\[
\frac{100}{9} = \frac{25}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{25 - 3AP}{3}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{100}{9} = \frac{25(25 - 3AP)}{9}
\]
Multiply both sides by 9:
\[
100 = 25(25 - 3AP)
\]
Divide both sides by 25:
\[
4 = 25 - 3AP
\]
Rearrange to solve for \(AP\):
\[
3AP = 21
\]
\[
AP = 7
\]
Thus, \(AP\) can be written as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 7\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 7 + 1 = 8\).

\[
\boxed{8}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon with its vertices colored either red or blue can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up in the positions originally occupied by red vertices. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the Total Number of Colorings:**
   Each of the 8 vertices of the octagon can be either red or blue. Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:
   \[
   2^8 = 256
   \]

2. **Determine the Favorable Colorings:**
   A coloring is favorable if there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all blue vertices move to the positions originally occupied by red vertices. This means that the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, i.e., there must be exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices. If there were a different number of blue and red vertices, it would be impossible to rotate the octagon to achieve the desired configuration.

   The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of 8 to be blue (and the remaining 4 to be red) is given by the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70
   \]

3. **Check for Rotational Symmetry:**
   For each of these 70 colorings, we need to check if there is a rotation that maps all blue vertices to red vertices. Consider a coloring with 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices. If we label the vertices in a clockwise manner as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, A_8\), a rotation by \(k\) positions (where \(k\) is an integer from 1 to 7) will map each vertex \(A_i\) to \(A_{i+k}\) (mod 8). For the coloring to be favorable, there must be a \(k\) such that the blue vertices are mapped to red vertices.

   This is possible if and only if the positions of the blue vertices are not symmetric in a way that no rotation can map them to the positions of the red vertices. However, for any coloring of 4 blue and 4 red vertices, there is always a rotation that will map the blue vertices to the red vertices. This is because the octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, and any arrangement of 4 blue and 4 red vertices can be rotated to match any other arrangement of 4 blue and 4 red vertices.

   Therefore, all 70 colorings are favorable.

4. **Calculate the Probability:**
   The probability that a randomly chosen coloring is favorable is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings:
   \[
   \frac{70}{256} = \frac{35}{128}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   The fraction \(\frac{35}{128}\) is already in its simplest form because 35 and 128 have no common factors other than 1.

6. **Find \(m + n\):**
   In the fraction \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{35}{128}\), we have \(m = 35\) and \(n = 128\). Therefore, \(m + n = 35 + 128 = 163\).

"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 0 \) when \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 1 \) when \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 0 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 1 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 4. Specifically, \( y = 0 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( y = 4 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = 0 \) when \( \cos(3 \pi y) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = 1 \) when \( \cos(3 \pi y) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 7: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = 0 \) when \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = 1 \) when \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 8: Find the intersection points
The intersection points of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) occur when both functions take the same value. Since both functions range from 0 to 4, we need to find the number of solutions to \( 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) for \( 0 \leq x, y \leq 1 \).

Given the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, we can see that there are 12 intersection points in the interval \( [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \).

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangular box. Let the dimensions be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). We are given two pieces of information: the area of the base and the volume of the box. The area of the base is \(ab = 54\) and the volume is \(abc = 23\). We need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, and then determine \(r^2\).

The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is half the length of the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \(d\) of the box is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]
Thus, the radius \(r\) is:
\[
r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}
\]
We need to find \(r^2\):
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4}
\]
To find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We already know \(ab = 54\) and \(abc = 23\). To find \(bc + ca + ab\), we can use the fact that \(c = \frac{23}{ab} = \frac{23}{54}\). Therefore:
\[
bc + ca = b \cdot \frac{23}{54} + a \cdot \frac{23}{54} = \frac{23}{54}(a + b)
\]
So:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2\left(54 + \frac{23}{54}(a + b)\right)
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0\). We can use the known values to find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) directly:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We need to find \(a + b\) and \(a + b + c\). Using the quadratic equation for \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
t^2 - (a+b)t + ab = 0 \implies t^2 - (a+b)t + 54 = 0
\]
The sum of the roots \(a + b\) is the coefficient of \(t\) with the opposite sign, and the product of the roots is 54. We also know:
\[
c = \frac{23}{54}
\]
So:
\[
a + b + c = a + b + \frac{23}{54}
\]
We need to find \(a + b\) such that the polynomial has real roots. Using the quadratic formula:
\[
a, b = \frac{(a+b) \pm \sqrt{(a+b)^2 - 4 \cdot 54}}{2}
\]
The discriminant must be non-negative:
\[
(a+b)^2 - 216 \geq 0 \implies (a+b)^2 \geq 216 \implies a+b \geq \sqrt{216} = 6\sqrt{6}
\]
We can use the fact that the sum of the roots of the polynomial is the coefficient of \(t\) with the opposite sign:
\[
a + b + c = \frac{23}{54} + \sqrt{216} = \frac{23}{54} + 6\sqrt{6}
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the roots is:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We know:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 216 + \frac{23}{54} \cdot 2 \cdot 6\sqrt{6} = 216 + \frac{23}{54} \cdot 12\sqrt{6} = 216 + \frac{23}{4.5} \cdot \sqrt{6} = 216 + \frac{23}{4.5} \cdot 6 = 216 + 30 = 246

Thus:
\[
r^2 = \frac{246}{4} = \frac{123}{2}

p + q = 123 + 2 = 125

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\), we have:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation, \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we have:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(x^{10} = y^x\)
2. \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\)

We will solve these equations step by step. First, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the first equation:

\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x)
\]

Using the property of logarithms \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\), we get:

\[
10 \ln(x) = x \ln(y)
\]

Rearrange this equation to express \(\ln(y)\) in terms of \(\ln(x)\):

\[
\ln(y) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}
\]

Next, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:

\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y})
\]

Again, using the property of logarithms, we get:

\[
10 \ln(y) = 4y \ln(x)
\]

Substitute \(\ln(y) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}\) into this equation:

\[
10 \left( \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x} \right) = 4y \ln(x)
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
\frac{100 \ln(x)}{x} = 4y \ln(x)
\]

Since \(\ln(x) \neq 0\) (because \(x > 1\)), we can divide both sides by \(\ln(x)\):

\[
\frac{100}{x} = 4y
\]

Rearrange this equation to express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Now substitute \(y = \frac{25}{x}\) back into the equation \(\ln(y) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}\):

\[
\ln\left( \frac{25}{x} \right) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}
\]

Using the property of logarithms \(\ln\left( \frac{a}{b} \right) = \ln(a) - \ln(b)\), we get:

\[
\ln(25) - \ln(x) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}
\]

Rearrange this equation to isolate \(\ln(x)\):

\[
\ln(25) = \ln(x) + \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}
\]

Factor out \(\ln(x)\) on the right side:

\[
\ln(25) = \ln(x) \left( 1 + \frac{10}{x} \right)
\]

Since \(\ln(25) = 2 \ln(5)\), we have:

\[
2 \ln(5) = \ln(x) \left( 1 + \frac{10}{x} \right)
\]

Let \(u = \ln(x)\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
2 \ln(5) = u \left( 1 + \frac{10}{e^u} \right)
\]

This equation is quite complex to solve algebraically, so we will use the fact that we need to find \(xy\). From \(y = \frac{25}{x}\), we have:

\[
xy = x \left( \frac{25}{x} \right) = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is:

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move will win if both players play optimally.

Let's start by identifying the losing positions. If the number of tokens left is 0, the player whose turn it is to move loses. Therefore, 0 is a losing position. If the number of tokens left is 1 or 4, the player whose turn it is to move can take all the tokens and win. Therefore, 1 and 4 are winning positions.

Now, let's consider the next few positions:
- If the number of tokens left is 2, the player whose turn it is to move can only take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the other player, who will then win. Therefore, 2 is a losing position.
- If the number of tokens left is 3, the player whose turn it is to move can only take 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the other player, who will then lose. Therefore, 3 is a winning position.
- If the number of tokens left is 5, the player whose turn it is to move can only take 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the other player, who will then win. Therefore, 5 is a losing position.
- If the number of tokens left is 6, the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the other player, who will then lose. Therefore, 6 is a winning position.
- If the number of tokens left is 7, the player whose turn it is to move can take 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the other player, who will then win. Therefore, 7 is a losing position.
- If the number of tokens left is 8, the player whose turn it is to move can take 4 tokens, leaving 4 tokens for the other player, who will then win. Therefore, 8 is a losing position.

From the above analysis, we can see that the losing positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8. We can generalize this pattern by observing that the losing positions are the numbers that can be written in the form \( 3k + 2 \) for non-negative integers \( k \). This is because:
- If \( n = 3k + 2 \), the player whose turn it is to move can only take 1 token, leaving \( 3k + 1 \) tokens, or 4 tokens, leaving \( 3k - 2 \) tokens. Both \( 3k + 1 \) and \( 3k - 2 \) are winning positions.
- If \( n = 3k \) or \( n = 3k + 1 \) or \( n = 3k + 3 \), the player whose turn it is to move can always take a number of tokens to leave a number of tokens in the form \( 3m + 2 \) for some integer \( m \), which is a losing position.

Therefore, the losing positions are the numbers that are congruent to 2 modulo 3. We need to count the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are not in this set. The number of positive integers less than or equal to 2024 is 2024. The number of positive integers less than or equal to 2024 that are congruent to 2 modulo 3 is the number of integers in the arithmetic sequence 2, 5, 8, ..., 2024. The number of terms in this sequence is given by:
\[ \frac{2024 - 2}{3} + 1 = \frac{2022}{3} + 1 = 674 + 1 = 675. \]

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are not congruent to 2 modulo 3 is:
\[ 2024 - 675 = 1349. \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{1349}\).","[1349, '1349']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins a prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the grand prize.

We need to find \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \]

Since winning the grand prize implies winning a prize, \( B \cap A = B \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. Jen wins the grand prize if all four of her chosen numbers match the four numbers drawn. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} \). There is only 1 way for Jen's chosen numbers to match the drawn numbers. Therefore:
\[ P(B) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210} \]

Now, we calculate \( P(A) \), the probability that Jen wins a prize. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers match the drawn numbers. We will use the complement rule to find this probability. The complement of event \( A \) is the event that Jen wins no prize, which means she has fewer than 2 matches. There are two cases to consider for the complement:
1. Jen has 0 matches.
2. Jen has 1 match.

**Case 1: Jen has 0 matches.**
The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of the 6 numbers that Jen did not choose is \( \binom{6}{4} \). Therefore:
\[ P(\text{0 matches}) = \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} \]

**Case 2: Jen has 1 match.**
The number of ways to choose 1 number out of the 4 numbers that Jen chose and 3 numbers out of the 6 numbers that Jen did not choose is \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} \). Therefore:
\[ P(\text{1 match}) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \cdot 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21} \]

Adding these probabilities together gives the probability that Jen has fewer than 2 matches:
\[ P(\text{fewer than 2 matches}) = P(\text{0 matches}) + P(\text{1 match}) = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42} \]

Therefore, the probability that Jen wins a prize is:
\[ P(A) = 1 - P(\text{fewer than 2 matches}) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42} \]

Now, we can find the conditional probability \( P(B \mid A) \):
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115} \]

The probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Since 1 and 115 are relatively prime, we have \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties involved.

1. **Identify the Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
   - Quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic because points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on the same circle.

2. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the Power of a Point theorem at point \(E\) with respect to the circle on which \(A, D, H, G\) lie. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \(E\) outside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one secant line through \(E\) are equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of another secant line through \(E\).

3. **Apply the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   - Let \(CE = x\). Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can write:
     \[
     DE \cdot EF = CE \cdot CF
     \]
   - However, we need to express \(DE\) and \(CF\) in terms of the given lengths. Notice that \(DE = DC + CE\) and \(CF = CB + BF\). But we don't have the lengths of \(DC\) and \(BF\) directly. Instead, we can use the fact that \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles (since they are regular polygons with 4 sides).

4. **Use the Properties of Rectangles:**
   - In rectangle \(ABCD\), \(AB = CD = 107\) and \(BC = AD = 16\).
   - In rectangle \(EFGH\), \(EF = GH = 184\) and \(FG = EH = 17\).

5. **Relate the Lengths Using Similarity:**
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are similar (because they are both rectangles), the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, the ratio of \(AB\) to \(EF\) is equal to the ratio of \(BC\) to \(FG\):
     \[
     \frac{AB}{EF} = \frac{BC}{FG}
     \]
   - Substituting the given lengths:
     \[
     \frac{107}{184} = \frac{16}{17}

   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     \frac{107}{184} = \frac{16}{17} = \frac{16 \cdot 11}{17 \cdot 11} = \frac{176}{187}
     \]
   - Since the ratios are not equal, we need to use the Power of a Point theorem directly.

6. **Solve for \(CE\):**
   - Using the Power of a Point theorem:
     \[
     DE \cdot EF = CE \cdot CF
     \]
   - Let \(DE = DC + CE = 16 + x\) and \(CF = CB + BF = 16 + 17 = 33\):
     \[
     (16 + x) \cdot 184 = x \cdot 33
     \]
   - Expand and simplify:
     \[
     2944 + 184x = 33x
     \]
     \[
     2944 = 33x - 184x
     \]
     \[
     2944 = -151x
     \]
     \[
     x = -\frac{2944}{151}
     \]
   - Since \(x\) must be positive, we re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the correct ratio and re-evaluate the Power of a Point theorem.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{107}{184} = \frac{16}{17}

   - Therefore, the correct length of \(CE\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, changing direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), and the four direction changes correspond to four points where the path switches from R to U or from U to R.

We can represent a path as a sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's. The four direction changes occur at four specific positions in this sequence, where the type of move changes. For example, if the path starts with R, the first change could be from R to U, the second change could be from U to R, and so on.

To count the number of such paths, we need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (since the path starts with either R or U and ends with the opposite move, there are 15 possible positions for the changes) where the direction changes. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of 15, which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

However, we need to consider that the path can start with either R or U, and the direction changes will be symmetric. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 by 2.

The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 is:
\[
\binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4!(15-4)!} = \frac{15!}{4!11!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365

"To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). This is because the magnitude of \(z\) is 4, and any complex number on the circle of radius 4 can be written in this form.

First, we substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).

We now expand each term:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + (75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)i) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i,
\]
\[
(24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i.
\]

Adding these two results together, we get:

(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given the conditions about the smaller circles and their arrangement.

First, let's analyze the arrangement of the smaller circles. We know that 2024 smaller circles, each with a radius of 1, are arranged in a similar pattern to the larger circles, each with a radius of 34. The centers of these smaller circles form a regular hexagonal pattern, and the distance between the centers of two adjacent smaller circles is 2 (since each circle has a radius of 1).

The number of smaller circles that can fit in a circle of radius \(R\) is given by the formula for the number of circles in a hexagonal packing:
\[ N = \left\lfloor \frac{\pi R^2}{\sqrt{3} s^2} \right\rfloor \]
where \(s\) is the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles. For our problem, \(s = 2\) and \(N = 2024\). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ 2024 = \left\lfloor \frac{\pi R^2}{\sqrt{3} \cdot 2^2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{\pi R^2}{4\sqrt{3}} \right\rfloor \]
This implies:
\[ 2024 \leq \frac{\pi R^2}{4\sqrt{3}} < 2025 \]
Multiplying through by \(4\sqrt{3}/\pi\), we get:
\[ \frac{2024 \cdot 4\sqrt{3}}{\pi} \leq R^2 < \frac{2025 \cdot 4\sqrt{3}}{\pi} \]
Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\) and \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\), we have:
\[ \frac{2024 \cdot 4 \cdot 1.732}{3.14159} \leq R^2 < \frac{2025 \cdot 4 \cdot 1.732}{3.14159} \]
\[ \frac{14000.768}{3.14159} \leq R^2 < \frac{14010.72}{3.14159} \]
\[ 4464.5 \leq R^2 < 4465.5 \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ 66.81 \leq R < 66.82 \]
Since \(R\) must be an integer, we conclude that \(R = 67\).

Now, we need to find the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\). The inradius of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[ r = \frac{A}{s} \]
where \(A\) is the area of the triangle and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter. The distance from the center of the larger circle to the side of the triangle is equal to the radius of the larger circle minus the inradius of the triangle:
\[ R - r = 34 \]
\[ 67 - r = 34 \]
\[ r = 33 \]

Thus, the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{33}{1}\), where \(m = 33\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 33 + 1 = 34\).

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the hyperbola given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Let the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) be such that \(ABCD\) forms a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. This implies that the points are symmetric with respect to the origin, and we can write them as \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(B = (-x_1, -y_1)\), \(C = (-x_1, y_1)\), and \(D = (x_1, -y_1)\).

Since \(A\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1.
\]

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x_1 - (-x_1))^2 + (-y_1 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(2x_1)^2 + (-2y_1)^2} = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}.
\]

We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\):
\[
BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2).
\]

From the hyperbola equation, we can express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):
\[
y_1^2 = 24\left(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24}{20}x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24.

Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_1^2 + \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11}{5}x_1^2 - 24\right) = \frac{44}{5}x_1^2 - 96.
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x_1^2\). Since \(x_1^2\) can be arbitrarily large (as \(x_1\) can take any value such that the point \(A\) lies on the hyperbola), the term \(\frac{44}{5}x_1^2\) can become arbitrarily large. However, the problem asks for the largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\). This implies that there is no upper bound for \(BD^2\) in the context of the problem, but the largest real number less than \(BD^2\) for any specific \(x_1\) is the value that \(BD^2\) approaches as \(x_1^2\) increases without bound.

Therefore, the largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is:

First, recall the formula for the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle:
\[

Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Next, since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we can use the fact that in a triangle, the product of the segments of the angle bisector from the vertex to the incenter and from the incenter to the circumcircle is equal to the product of the segments of the angle bisector from the vertex to the circumcircle and from the circumcircle to the incenter. This property can be expressed as:
\[

\[
IA \cdot \sqrt{13} = 78

\[

IA^2 = AB \cdot AC \left(1 - \frac{BC^2}{(AB + AC)^2}\right)
\]
However, since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we can use another property that simplifies the problem. The product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the formula:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} \cdot \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}} = \frac{r^2}{\sin^2 \frac{A}{2}}
\]
But a simpler approach is to use the fact that in a triangle with \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is given by:
\[
AB \cdot AC = R \cdot (R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 13 \cdot (13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13

"To find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation to get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]

Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we find:

\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to the system of equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We can assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we have \(c = 300 - a - b\). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:

\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation in \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]

To find possible values for \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the discriminant of the quadratic equation in \(a\):

\[
a^2 + (b-300)a + (b^2 - 300b + 20,000) = 0.
\]

The discriminant \(\Delta\) of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square:

\[
\Delta = (b-300)^2 - 4(b^2 - 300b + 20,000) = b^2 - 600b + 90,000 - 4b^2 + 1200b - 80,000 = -3b^2 + 600b + 10,000.
\]

We need \(-3b^2 + 600b + 10,000\) to be a perfect square. Let's test some values of \(b\) to see if we can find any solutions.

First, we check the boundary values. If \(b = 0\):

\[
-3(0)^2 + 600(0) + 10,000 = 10,000,
\]
\[
a^2 - 300a + 20,000 = 0.
\]

The solutions to this quadratic equation are:

\[
a = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]

Thus, \(a = 200\) or \(a = 100\). If \(a = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 0 = 100\). If \(a = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 0 = 200\). So, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\) and \((100, 0, 200)\).

Next, we check \(b = 100\):

\[
-3(100)^2 + 600(100) + 10,000 = -30,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 = 40,000,
\]
\[
a^2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0.
\]

The solutions to this quadratic equation are:

\[
a = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{40,000 - 40,000}}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100.
\]

Thus, \(a = 100\) and \(c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100\). So, the solution is \((100, 100, 100)\).

Finally, we check \(b = 200\):

\[
-3(200)^2 + 600(200) + 10,000 = -120,000 + 120,000 + 10,000 = 10,000,
\]
\[
a^2 - 100a + 20,000 = 0.
\]

The solutions to this quadratic equation are:

\[
a = \frac{100 \pm \sqrt{10,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{100 \pm \sqrt{-70,000}}{2}.
\]

Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for \(a\).

Therefore, the only solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), and \((100, 100, 100)\). Since the order of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) does not matter, we count each distinct set of values. The distinct sets are \((200, 0, 100)\) and \((100, 100, 100)\).

Thus, the number of distinct triples \((a, b, c)\) is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The points \(A\) and \(B\) are given as \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line passing through these points is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\), \(x_1 = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(y_1 = 0\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we consider a segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length in the first quadrant, where \(P = (p, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, q)\). The length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + q^2} = 1 \implies p^2 + q^2 = 1
\]
The slope of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{q - 0}{0 - p} = -\frac{q}{p}
\]
The equation of the line passing through \(P\) and \(Q\) is:
\[
y = -\frac{q}{p}x + q
\]
We need to find the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). This point \(C\) must satisfy the equation of \(\overline{AB}\) and have a slope that is not equal to \(-\frac{q}{p}\) for any \(p\) and \(q\) such that \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\).

The slope of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is \(-\sqrt{3}\), so the slope of the perpendicular bisector of \(\overline{AB}\) is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\). The midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2} + 0}{2}, \frac{0 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)
\]
The equation of the perpendicular bisector is:
\[
y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{4}\right) \implies y - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{12} \implies y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]
We find the intersection of this perpendicular bisector with the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) by solving the system of equations:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]
Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:
\[
-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]
\[
-\sqrt{3}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
-\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]
\[
-\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x = -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{6}
\]
\[
-\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}x = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]
\[
x = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Substituting \(x = \frac{1}{4}\) back into the equation of \(\overline{AB}\), we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of point \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{16}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). The values of \(p\) and \(q\) are 1 and 4, respectively, so \(p + q = 1 + 4 = 5\).

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, meaning \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). First, observe that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity, since \((\omega^{2k})^{13} = (\omega^{13})^{2k} = 1^{2k} = 1\). Thus, \(\omega^{2k}\) is a root of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\).

Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the product \(P(\omega^0) P(\omega^1) P(\omega^2) \cdots P(\omega^{12})\). Notice that \(P(x)\) can be rewritten as:
\[P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1.\]

We will use the fact that the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of unity can be found using properties of polynomials. Specifically, if \(Q(x)\) is a polynomial of degree \(n\) with roots \(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n\), then \(Q(x)\) can be written as \(Q(x) = c(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\cdots(x-r_n)\), and the product \(Q(r_1) Q(r_2) \cdots Q(r_n)\) is given by \(c^n Q(0)^n\).

In our case, the polynomial \(P(x)\) is a quadratic polynomial, and we are evaluating it at the 13th roots of unity. The product of \(P(x)\) evaluated at all 13th roots of unity is the same as the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) raised to the 13th power, which is a constant term of the polynomial \(P(x)\) raised to the 13th power.

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the product of \(P(x)\) evaluated at all 13th roots of unity is the same as the constant term of the polynomial \(P(x)\) raised to the 13th power, which is a constant term of the polynomial \(P(x)\) raised to the 13th power.

After evaluating the product, we find that the product is 1000. Therefore, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{1000}\).","[1000, '1000']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To find the smallest base \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the conditions under which a number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it is a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we have:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( c \) to be an integer. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]
For \( c \) to be an integer, \( 4ab - 4a + 1 \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \):
\[ 4ab - 4a + 1 = k^2 \]
Rearranging, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = k^2 - 1 \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (k - 1)(k + 1) \]
Since \( k \) must be odd (because \( k^2 \) is odd), let \( k = 2m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2m + 1 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (2m)(2m + 2) \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = 4m(m + 1) \]
\[ a(b - 1) = m(m + 1) \]
This equation tells us that \( a(b - 1) \) must be the product of two consecutive integers. For each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \), there is a corresponding \( m \) such that \( m(m + 1) = a(b - 1) \). The number of solutions \( m \) is equal to the number of ways to write \( a(b - 1) \) as a product of two consecutive integers, which is at most 2 (since \( m \) and \( m+1 \) are consecutive integers).

Therefore, for each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \), there are at most 2 values of \( c \) that satisfy the equation. This means there are at most \( 2(b-1) \) \( b \)-beautiful numbers. We need to find the smallest \( b \) such that \( 2(b-1) > 10 \):
\[ 2(b-1) > 10 \]
\[ b-1 > 5 \]
\[ b > 6 \]
The smallest integer \( b \) that satisfies this inequality is \( b = 7 \). To confirm, we check the number of \( 7 \)-beautiful numbers:
For \( b = 7 \), \( a \) can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. For each \( a \), there are at most 2 values of \( c \), so there are at most \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) \( 7 \)-beautiful numbers, which is more than 10.

Thus, the smallest base \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers is:

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible configurations of the rectangles.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle in this context is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides, where each pair is formed by vertices that are either adjacent or connected by a diagonal.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the possible pairs of vertices:**
   - Each pair of opposite sides of the rectangle must be formed by vertices that are either adjacent or connected by a diagonal.
   - For a dodecagon, the possible distances between the vertices in a pair are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (since the distance 6 would form a diameter, not a side or a diagonal of a rectangle).

2. **Count the number of valid pairs:**
   - For each vertex \( A_i \), the possible vertices that can form a pair with it are \( A_{i+1}, A_{i+2}, A_{i+3}, A_{i+4}, A_{i+5} \) ( indices taken modulo 12).
   - Therefore, each vertex has 5 possible pairs.

3. **Form the rectangles:**
   - Once we have chosen a pair of vertices \( (A_i, A_{i+k}) \), the other pair of vertices must be \( (A_{i+6}, A_{i+6+k}) \) to ensure the sides are opposite.
   - This means that for each pair \( (A_i, A_{i+k}) \), there is exactly one corresponding pair \( (A_{i+6}, A_{i+6+k}) \).

4. **Calculate the total number of rectangles:**
   - Since there are 12 vertices and each vertex has 5 possible pairs, the total number of pairs is \( 12 \times 5 = 60 \).
   - However, each rectangle is counted twice (once for each pair of opposite sides), so the total number of rectangles is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

Thus, the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon is \(\boxed{30}\).","[30, '30']",315,"[315, '315']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions and then calculate the sum of the squares of these integers.

### Step 1: Identify the conditions
1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

### Step 2: Determine the number of items in the list
Since the mode is 9 and it is unique, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's assume the list has \( n \) items. The median of the list will be the middle item if \( n \) is odd, or the average of the two middle items if \( n \) is even. Since the median is a single positive integer that does not appear in the list, \( n \) must be odd.

### Step 3: Construct the list
Let's start with the smallest possible list and increase its size until we find a valid solution.

#### Case \( n = 5 \)
If \( n = 5 \), the median is the third item in the list. Let the list be \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \) where \( a_3 \) is the median. Since the mode is 9, at least two of the items must be 9. Let's assume \( a_2 = 9 \) and \( a_4 = 9 \). Then the list is \( a_1, 9, a_3, 9, a_5 \). The sum of the items is \( a_1 + 9 + a_3 + 9 + a_5 = 30 \), so \( a_1 + a_3 + a_5 = 12 \). The median \( a_3 \) must be a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Let's try \( a_3 = 6 \). Then \( a_1 + 6 + a_5 = 12 \), so \( a_1 + a_5 = 6 \). The possible pairs \((a_1, a_5)\) are \((1, 5)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((3, 3)\). However, \( a_3 = 6 \) is the median, so \( a_1 \) and \( a_5 \) cannot be 6. Therefore, the only valid pair is \((2, 4)\). The list is \( 2, 9, 6, 9, 4 \). The mode is 9, the median is 6, and the sum is 30. This list satisfies all the conditions.

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the squares of the items in the list
The list is \( 2, 9, 6, 9, 4 \). The sum of the squares is:
\[
2^2 + 9^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 81 + 36 + 81 + 16 = 218

\[

The two numbers read from left to right are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:

\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

The three numbers read from top to bottom are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:

\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

We can simplify these equations. From the first equation, we get:

\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

From the second equation, we get:

\[
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

We can rewrite the second equation as:

\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]

Let's denote \(S_1 = a + b + c\) and \(S_2 = d + e + f\). Then the second equation becomes:

\[
10S_1 + S_2 = 99
\]

Since \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are sums of digits, \(S_1\) ranges from 0 to 27 and \(S_2\) ranges from 0 to 27. The only possible value for \(S_1\) that satisfies \(10S_1 + S_2 = 99\) is \(S_1 = 9\) and \(S_2 = 9\). Therefore, we have:

\[
a + b + c = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad d + e + f = 9

Now, substitute \(S_1 = 9\) and \(S_2 = 9\) back into the first equation:

\[
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]

Since \(a + d\), \(b + e\), and \(c + f\) are digits, the only possible values are \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\). Therefore, we have:

\[
a + d = 9, \quad b + e = 9, \quad c + f = 9
\]

Now, we need to count the number of solutions to these equations. For each pair \((a, d)\), \((b, e)\), and \((c, f)\), there are 10 possible pairs (since \(a, d, b, e, c, f\) are digits from 0 to 9 and their sum is 9). Therefore, the total number of solutions is:

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in its exponential form. The given equations are:

\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(xyz)^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the equations. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). Therefore, \(m = 39\) and \(n = 4\), and \(m + n = 39 + 4 = 43\).

"To find the side length of the regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, we start by considering the properties of such a hexagon. A regular hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids and a rectangle in the middle.

Given that the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are 200, 240, and 300, we can use the fact that this triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides \(BC\), \(DE\), and \(FA\). Since the hexagon is regular, the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are equal to the sides \(BC\), \(DE\), and \(FA\), respectively.

Let the side length of the hexagon be \(s\). The extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. The extensions of the sides \(BC\), \(DE\), and \(FA\) will also form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300.

The key insight is that the sides of the hexagon are related to the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides. Specifically, the side length \(s\) of the hexagon is the same as the length of the sides of the hexagon that are parallel to the sides of the triangle.

To find \(s\), we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides of the hexagon that are parallel to the sides of the triangle is equal to the perimeter of the triangle. Since the hexagon is regular, each side of the hexagon is equal to \(s\).

The perimeter of the triangle is:
\[200 + 240 + 300 = 740\]

Since the hexagon is regular, the perimeter of the hexagon is:
\[6s\]

However, the sides of the hexagon that are parallel to the sides of the triangle are only three sides of the hexagon, so the sum of these sides is:
\[3s\]

This sum must be equal to the perimeter of the triangle:
\[3s = 740\]

Solving for \(s\):
\[s = \frac{740}{3} = 246.67\]

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) and the set \( B \). The set \( B \) consists of all non-empty subsets of positive integers whose maximum element is in \( A \). Given that the number of subsets in \( B \) is 2024, we need to determine the elements of \( A \) and then find their sum.

First, let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). The subsets in \( B \) are all subsets of the set of positive integers that include at least one element from \( A \) and whose maximum element is the largest element in \( A \) that is included in the subset. For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the subsets of \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as the maximum element are all subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i\} \) that include \( a_i \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i-1} \).

Since the total number of subsets in \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets for each maximum element in \( A \), we have:
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

To find the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), we need to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. First, we convert 2024 to its binary representation:
\[
2024_{10} = 11111101000_2
\]
This binary representation tells us that:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]
Thus, the exponents are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3. Therefore, the elements of \( A \) are:
\[
a_1 = 11, a_2 = 10, a_3 = 9, a_4 = 8, a_5 = 7, a_6 = 6, a_7 = 4
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55

Thus, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit positive integer \( N \) such that when one of its digits is increased by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits, and \( a \neq 0 \) since \( N \) is a four-digit number.

First, we express \( N \) in terms of its digits:
\[ N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. \]

We need to check the divisibility condition for each digit when it is increased by 1. Let's start with the digit \( d \):
\[ N + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1. \]
We need \( N + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), which simplifies to:
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}. \]
Since \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), and \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we have:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv -1 \pmod{7}, \]
or equivalently:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7}. \]

Next, let's check the digit \( c \):
\[ N + 10 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 10. \]
We need \( N + 10 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), which simplifies to:
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 10 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}, \]
or equivalently:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv -3 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7}. \]

We can continue this process for the digits \( b \) and \( a \), but it is more efficient to find the largest \( N \) that satisfies the condition for \( d \) and then check if it also satisfies the conditions for \( c, b, \) and \( a \).

Let's start with the largest possible value for \( d \), which is 6:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 0 \pmod{7}. \]

Now, let's try the largest possible value for \( c \), which is 6:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3 \cdot 6 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 6a + 2b + 18 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ 6a + 2b + 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ 6a + 2b \equiv -4 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ 6a + 2b \equiv 3 \pmod{7}. \]

Next, let's try the largest possible value for \( b \), which is 6:
\[ 6a + 2 \cdot 6 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 6a + 12 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ 6a + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ 6a \equiv -2 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ 6a \equiv 5 \pmod{7}. \]

To solve for \( a \), we need the multiplicative inverse of 6 modulo 7. The inverse of 6 modulo 7 is 6, since \( 6 \cdot 6 = 36 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \). Therefore:
\[ a \equiv 5 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ a \equiv 30 \pmod{7}, \]
or:
\[ a \equiv 2 \pmod{7}. \]

The largest possible value for \( a \) is 2. Thus, the largest four-digit number \( N \) that satisfies the condition is:
\[ N = 2666. \]

Now, we need to find \( Q \) and \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000:
\[ Q = \left\lfloor \frac{2666}{1000} \right\rfloor = 2, \]
\[ R = 2666 \mod 1000 = 666. \]

Finally, we find \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 2 + 666 = 668. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it is on the inside and outside of the sphere, respectively. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane that is 6 units away from its center. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

First, let's find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that forms the torus. This distance is the sum of the distance from the center of the torus to the axis of rotation and the radius of the torus:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9. \]

When the torus is on the outside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that forms the torus is 9, and the radius of the sphere is 11. The radius \( r_o \) of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is the difference between the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle:
\[ r_o = 11 - 9 = 2. \]

When the torus is on the inside of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that forms the torus is still 9, but the radius of the sphere is 11. The radius \( r_i \) of the circle along which the torus is tangent to the sphere is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle:
\[ r_i = 11 + 9 = 20. \]

The difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 20 - 2 = 18. \]

Since 18 is already in its simplest form, we have \( m = 18 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 18 + 1 = 19 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 50 skyfies (25 white and 25 black) on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one skyfie, all skyfies in the same row and all skyfies in the same column are the same color, and any additional skyfie placed would violate one of these conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations of the skyfies on the grid. Each row and each column must be monochromatic, meaning that each row and each column can either be all white or all black. This implies that the entire grid can be divided into two parts: a white part and a black part, where each part is a union of entire rows and entire columns.

The number of ways to choose which rows and which columns will be white (and therefore which will be black) is equivalent to choosing a subset of the rows and a subset of the columns. There are \(2^5 = 32\) subsets of the rows and \(2^5 = 32\) subsets of the columns. However, the empty subset for rows and the empty subset for columns together represent the configuration where no skyfies are placed, which is not a valid configuration since we need to place at least some skyfies.

Therefore, the total number of valid configurations is:
