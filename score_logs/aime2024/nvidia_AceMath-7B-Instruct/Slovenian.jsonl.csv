"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Aya to travel 9 kilometers at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour, including the time she spends in the kavarni.

First, let's find the time it takes for Aya to travel 9 kilometers at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour. The time \( T_1 \) is given by:
\[
T_1 = \frac{9}{s} \text{ hours}
\]
Since the total time including the time spent in the kavarni is 4 hours, we have:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
Next, let's find the time it takes for Aya to travel 9 kilometers at a speed of \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour. The time \( T_2 \) is given by:
\[
T_2 = \frac{9}{s+2} \text{ hours}
\]
Since the total time including the time spent in the kavarni is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, we have:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]
We now have a system of two equations:
1. \(\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4\)
2. \(\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4\)

We can eliminate \(\frac{t}{60}\) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 4 - 2.4
\]
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{s+2 - s}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6 s(s+2)
\]
\[
18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s
\]
\[
1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0
\]
We can simplify this quadratic equation by dividing every term by 1.6:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) kilometers per hour.

Now, we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4
\]
\[
t = 24
\]

Finally, we need to find the time it takes for Aya to travel 9 kilometers at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) kilometers per hour:
\[
T_3 = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]
Adding the time spent in the kavarni, the total time is:
\[
3 + \frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \text{ hours}
\]
Converting 3.4 hours to hours and minutes, we get:
\[
3.4 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours and } 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Aya to travel 9 kilometers at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour, including the time spent in the kavarni, is \(\boxed{3 \text{ hours and } 24 \text{ minutes}}\).","[3, '3']",204,"[204, '204']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon can be rotated such that all its blue vertices are in the positions of the original red vertices. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of colorings:**
   Each vertex of the octagon can be either red or blue, and there are 8 vertices. Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:
   \[
   2^8 = 256
   \]

2. **Determine the number of favorable colorings:**
   A coloring is favorable if the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices are in the positions of the original red vertices. This means that the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the set of red vertices that is invariant under rotation. The only way this can happen is if the set of blue vertices is either the empty set or the set of all vertices. However, since we are looking for non-trivial rotations, the only possible configuration is that the set of blue vertices is the set of all vertices, which is not possible because it would mean all vertices are blue, and there would be no red vertices to match.

   Therefore, the only possible configuration is that the set of blue vertices is the empty set, which means all vertices are red. This configuration is invariant under any rotation.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   There is only one favorable coloring (all vertices are red), so the number of favorable colorings is 1. The probability is the number of favorable colorings divided by the total number of colorings:
   \[
   \frac{1}{256}
   \]

4. **Express the probability in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime:**
   Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 256\), and they are coprime. Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{1}{256}\).

5. **Find \(m + n\):**
   \[
   m + n = 1 + 256 = 257

"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = x - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \frac{1}{2} - x \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < 0 \), \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \frac{1}{2} + x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = -x - \frac{1}{2} \).

Thus, \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = x - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{1}{4} - x \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq x < 0 \), \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{1}{4} + x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = -x - \frac{1}{4} \).

Thus, \( g(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 5: Find the intersection points
The graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are both symmetric about the line \( y = x \) and range from 0 to 1. To find the number of intersection points, we need to consider the behavior of the functions and their compositions.

Since both functions are continuous and piecewise linear, and they both map the interval [0, 1] onto itself, they will intersect at exactly 4 points in the unit square [0, 1] x [0, 1]. This is because each function is a piecewise linear function with 4 segments, and the composition of two such functions will result in a piecewise linear function with 16 segments, each of which can intersect the other function exactly once.

Therefore, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide one of the factors \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) with multiplicity at least 2. This implies that \( p \) must be a prime number that divides \( n^4 + 1 \) and the derivative of \( n^4 + 1 \) at \( n \) must also be divisible by \( p \).

The derivative of \( n^4 + 1 \) is:
\[
4n^3.
\]
For \( p \) to divide \( 4n^3 \), \( p \) must be either 2 or a prime factor of \( n \). However, if \( p \) divides \( n \), then \( p \) must also divide \( n^4 + 1 = 1 \), which is impossible. Therefore, \( p \) must be 2.

Now, we need to check if \( p = 2 \) is indeed the smallest prime such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \). Let's test \( n = 1 \):
\[
1^4 + 1 = 2,
\]
which is not divisible by 4. Let's test \( n = 2 \):
\[
2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17,
\]
which is not divisible by 4. Let's test \( n = 3 \):
\[
3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82,
\]
which is not divisible by 4. Let's test \( n = 4 \):
\[
4^4 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257,
\]
which is not divisible by 4. Let's test \( n = 5 \):
\[
5^4 + 1 = 625 + 1 = 626,
\]
which is not divisible by 4. Let's test \( n = 6 \):
\[
6^4 + 1 = 1296 + 1 = 1297,
\]
which is not divisible by 4. Let's test \( n = 7 \):
\[
7^4 + 1 = 2401 + 1 = 2402,
\]
which is divisible by 4. Therefore, \( p = 2 \) is indeed the smallest prime such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \). From our previous tests, we see that the smallest such \( m \) is 7.

Thus, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x\left(y^x\right) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
y^x = x^{10}
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
x^{4y} = y^{10}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(y^x) = \ln(x^{10})
\]

Using the property of logarithms that \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\), we get:

\[
x \ln(y) = 10 \ln(x)
\]

Rearranging this equation, we obtain:

\[
\frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

This can be written as:

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Now, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:

\[
\ln(x^{4y}) = \ln(y^{10})
\]

Again, using the property of logarithms, we get:

\[
4y \ln(x) = 10 \ln(y)
\]

Rearranging this equation, we obtain:

\[
\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(y)} = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

This can be written as:

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

We now have two equations:

\[
\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{\log_x(y)}\), we substitute \(\log_x(y)\) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
\frac{1}{\log_x(y)} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Substituting \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\) into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\frac{10}{x}} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
\frac{x}{10} = \frac{5}{2y}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \(xy\), we get:

\[
2xy = 50
\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:

\[
xy = 25

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is:

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the other player plays optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.

Let's start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If \( n = 1 \), Alice wins by taking the last coin.
- If \( n = 2 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 1 coin.
- If \( n = 3 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 2 coins.
- If \( n = 4 \), Alice wins by taking all 4 coins.
- If \( n = 5 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 4 coins.
- If \( n = 6 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 5 coins.
- If \( n = 7 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 6 coins.
- If \( n = 8 \), Alice wins by taking 4 coins, leaving Bob with 4 coins.

From the above, we see that \( n = 8 \) is a winning position. Now, let's consider \( n = 9 \):
- If Bob takes 1 coin, Alice is left with 8 coins, which is a winning position for Alice.
- If Bob takes 4 coins, Alice is left with 5 coins, which is a winning position for Alice.

Thus, \( n = 9 \) is a losing position. We can continue this process to identify more losing positions:
- If \( n = 10 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 9 coins.
- If \( n = 11 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 10 coins.
- If \( n = 12 \), Alice wins by taking 4 coins, leaving Bob with 8 coins.
- If \( n = 13 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 12 coins.
- If \( n = 14 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 13 coins.
- If \( n = 15 \), Alice wins by taking 1 coin, leaving Bob with 14 coins.
- If \( n = 16 \), Alice wins by taking 4 coins, leaving Bob with 12 coins.

From the above, we see that \( n = 16 \) is a winning position. Now, let's consider \( n = 17 \):
- If Bob takes 1 coin, Alice is left with 16 coins, which is a winning position for Alice.
- If Bob takes 4 coins, Alice is left with 13 coins, which is a winning position for Alice.

Thus, \( n = 17 \) is a losing position. We can see a pattern emerging: the losing positions are \( n = 9, 17, 25, \ldots \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 9 and a common difference of 8. The general term of this sequence is given by:
\[ a_k = 9 + (k-1) \cdot 8 = 8k + 1 \]

We need to find the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 8k + 1 \leq 2024 \):
\[ 8k + 1 \leq 2024 \]
\[ 8k \leq 2023 \]
\[ k \leq \frac{2023}{8} \]
\[ k \leq 252.875 \]
\[ k \leq 252 \]

Therefore, there are 252 losing positions for \( n \leq 2024 \). Since there are 2024 positive integers less than or equal to 2024, the number of winning positions is:
\[ 2024 - 252 = 1772 \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and Bob has a winning strategy is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins a prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the main prize.

We need to find \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \]

Since winning the main prize implies winning a prize, \( B \cap A = B \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that Jen wins the main prize. Jen wins the main prize if all four of her chosen numbers are among the four numbers drawn. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} \). There is only 1 way for Jen's chosen numbers to be the same as the drawn numbers. Therefore:
\[ P(B) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210} \]

Now, we calculate \( P(A) \), the probability that Jen wins a prize. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the four numbers drawn. We will use the complement rule to find this probability. The complement of event \( A \) is the event that fewer than 2 of Jen's chosen numbers are among the four numbers drawn. This means either 0 or 1 of Jen's chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers.

1. **Probability that none of Jen's chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers:**
   The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of the remaining 6 numbers (since 4 numbers are already chosen by Jen) is \( \binom{6}{4} \). Therefore:
   \[ P(\text{0 of Jen's numbers are drawn}) = \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} \]

2. **Probability that exactly 1 of Jen's chosen numbers is among the drawn numbers:**
   The number of ways to choose 1 number out of Jen's 4 chosen numbers and 3 numbers out of the remaining 6 numbers is \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} \). Therefore:
   \[ P(\text{1 of Jen's numbers is drawn}) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \cdot 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21} \]

Adding these probabilities together gives the probability that fewer than 2 of Jen's chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers:
\[ P(\text{fewer than 2 of Jen's numbers are drawn}) = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42} \]

Therefore, the probability that at least 2 of Jen's chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers is:
\[ P(A) = 1 - P(\text{fewer than 2 of Jen's numbers are drawn}) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42} \]

Now, we can find \( P(B \mid A) \):
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115} \]

The probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Since 1 and 115 are relatively prime, we have \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore:
\[ m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \]

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the shapes involved.

   - \(ABCD\) is a rectangle with \(AB = 107\) and \(BC = 16\).
   - \(EFGH\) is another rectangle with \(EF = 184\) and \(FG = 17\).
   - Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear.
   - Points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle.

2. **Determine the coordinates of the points:**
   - Place \(D\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).

   - Place \(B\) at \((16, 107)\).

   - Points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle. The center of this circle is the midpoint of the diagonal \(AG\).
   - The coordinates of the midpoint of \(AG\) are \(\left(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{107 + 17}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{x}{2}, 62\right)\).
   - The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to any of the points on the circle, say \(A\).
   - The distance from the center to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{\left(0 - \frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + (107 - 62)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + 45^2} = \sqrt{\frac{x^2}{4} + 2025}\).

   - The length of \(CE\) is the distance between \(C\) and \(E\), which is \(|16 - x|\).

   - We know that \(y - x = 184\) and \(y > 16\). Since \(y = x + 184\), we have \(x + 184 > 16\), so \(x > -168\).
   - The exact value of \(x\) is not needed to find \(CE\), as \(CE = 16 - x\).

For example, a valid sequence might look like RRRRUUUU RRRRUUUU or UUUURRRR UUUURRRR, etc. The key is to determine how many ways we can arrange these segments.

We need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (since there are 15 points where a direction change can occur) to place the direction changes. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of 15 to place the dividers between the segments. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

However, we also need to consider that the path must start with either R or U and end with the opposite direction. This means that the number of segments of R and U must be such that the path starts and ends correctly. Specifically, if the path starts with R, it must end with U, and vice versa. This implies that the number of segments of R and U must be such that the total number of R's and U's is 8 each.

Given that the path has exactly five segments, the only way to have an equal number of R's and U's is if the path has 2 segments of R and 3 segments of U, or 3 segments of R and 2 segments of U. The number of ways to arrange these segments is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{2}\) or \(\binom{5}{3}\), which are equal.

Therefore, the number of valid paths is given by:
\[
\binom{15}{4} \times 2 = 1365 \times 2 = 2730
\]

Thus, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{2730}\).","[2730, '2730']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the maximum possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the reciprocal \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting \(z\) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96+144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96+144i)e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Using the Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]
Expanding both terms, we get:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
\]
Combining like terms, the real part of the expression is:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]
To maximize the real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\) and \(\phi\) is an angle such that \(\cos\phi = \frac{324}{R}\) and \(\sin\phi = \frac{432}{R}\).

Calculating \(R\), we get:
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]
Thus, the maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) is \(R = 540\).

Therefore, the maximum possible real part of the expression is \(\boxed{540}\).","[540, '540']",540,"[540, '540']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given the conditions about the arrangement of the circles. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Arrangement of Circles
We have two sets of circles:
1. Eight circles with radius \(34\) that are tangent to each other and two of them are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\).
2. Two thousand and twenty-four circles with radius \(1\) that are tangent to each other and two of them are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\).

### Step 2: Calculating the Inradius for the First Set of Circles
The eight circles with radius \(34\) are tangent to each other, forming a regular octagon. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is \(2 \times 34 = 68\). The inradius \(r_1\) of the octagon formed by the centers of these circles can be calculated using the formula for the inradius of a regular octagon:
\[ r_1 = \frac{68}{2} \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 34 \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 34 \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 34 \left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 17 (2 + \sqrt{2}) \]

Since the circles are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\), the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is the sum of the radius of the circle and the inradius of the octagon:
\[ r = 34 + 17 (2 + \sqrt{2}) = 34 + 34 + 17\sqrt{2} = 68 + 17\sqrt{2} \]

### Step 3: Calculating the Inradius for the Second Set of Circles
Similarly, the two thousand and twenty-four circles with radius \(1\) are tangent to each other, forming a regular polygon. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is \(2 \times 1 = 2\). The inradius \(r_2\) of the polygon formed by the centers of these circles can be calculated using the formula for the inradius of a regular polygon:
\[ r_2 = \frac{2}{2} \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 1 \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 1 \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 1 \left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Since the circles are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\), the inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is the sum of the radius of the circle and the inradius of the polygon:
\[ r = 1 + \frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \]

### Step 4: Equating the Inradii
Since the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is the same in both cases, we equate the two expressions:
\[ 68 + 17\sqrt{2} = \frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \]

To solve for \(\sqrt{2}\), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 136 + 34\sqrt{2} = 4 + \sqrt{2} \]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 132 = -33\sqrt{2} \]
\[ \sqrt{2} = -4 \]

This is not possible, so we need to re-e-valuate the problem. The correct approach is to use the fact that the inradius of the triangle is the same in both cases, and the correct inradius is:
\[ r = \frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \]

### Step 5: Simplifying the Inradius
The inradius \(r\) is already in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m = 4 + \sqrt{2}\) and \(n = 2\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are not integers, we need to re-e-valuate the problem. The correct inradius is:
\[ r = \frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \]

### Step 6: Final Answer
The correct inradius is:
\[ r = \frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]","[100, '100']",197,"[197, '197']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus. The hyperbola is given by:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

Since the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be represented as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\) respectively. The diagonals of the rhombus are \(AC\) and \(BD\), where \(AC = 2y_1\) and \(BD = 2x_1\).

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2x_1\), so \(BD^2 = 4x_1^2\). We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) that is less than the value of \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. To do this, we first express \(y_1\) in terms of \(x_1\) using the equation of the hyperbola:

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

Rearranging for \(y_1^2\), we get:

\[
y_1^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{24}{20} (x_1^2 - 20) = \frac{6}{5} (x_1^2 - 20)
\]

Since \(y_1^2\) must be non-negative, \(x_1^2 \geq 20\). The value of \(BD^2\) is \(4x_1^2\), and the minimum value of \(x_1^2\) is 20. Therefore, the minimum value of \(BD^2\) is:

\[
4 \times 20 = 80
\]

However, we are asked to find the largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi. Since \(x_1^2\) can be any value greater than or equal to 20, \(BD^2\) can be any value greater than or equal to 80. The largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is the value that \(BD^2\) approaches as \(x_1^2\) approaches 20 from the right, which is 80.

Thus, the largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is:

\[

"To determine the number of prebivalci in Aimevilla who have all four items (diamond earrings, a complete set of golf clubs, a tennis racket, and a heart-shaped chocolate), we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of prebivalci with diamond earrings.
- Let \( B \) be the set of prebivalci with a complete set of golf clubs.
- Let \( C \) be the set of prebivalci with a tennis racket.
- Let \( D \) be the set of prebivalci with a heart-shaped chocolate.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of prebivalci is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of prebivalci with diamond earrings is \( |A| = 195 \).
- The number of prebivalci with a complete set of golf clubs is \( |B| = 367 \).
- The number of prebivalci with a tennis racket is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of prebivalci with a heart-shaped chocolate is \( |D| = 900 \) (since every prebivalc has a heart-shaped chocolate).
- The number of prebivalci with exactly two of these items is \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 437 \).
- The number of prebivalci with exactly three of these items is \( |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| = 234 \).

We need to find the number of prebivalci with all four items, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets, we have:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Since every prebivalc has a heart-shaped chocolate, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
\[
900 = 1924 - 437 + 234 - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
\[
900 = 1721 - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 1721 - 900
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 821

"To find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to this system. Let's assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we have \(c = 300 - a - b\). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:
\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]
To find possible values for \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the quadratic formula. However, a more practical approach is to test some values. Let's start with \(a = 100\):
\[
100^2 + b^2 + 100b - 300 \cdot 100 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
10,000 + b^2 + 100b - 30,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 200) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 0 = 200\). If \(b = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 200 = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\).

Next, let's test \(a = 200\):
\[
200^2 + b^2 + 200b - 300 \cdot 200 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
40,000 + b^2 + 200b - 60,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 100b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 100) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 0 = 100\). If \(b = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 100 = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\) and \((200, 100, 0)\).

Finally, let's test \(a = 0\):
\[
0^2 + b^2 + 0 \cdot b - 300 \cdot 0 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20,000}}{2 \cdot 1}\), we get:
\[
b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2},
\]
\[
b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2},
\]
\[
b = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]
So, \(b = 200\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 0 - 200 = 100\). If \(b = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 0 - 100 = 200\). Therefore, the solutions are \((0, 200, 100)\) and \((0, 100, 200)\).

Combining all the solutions, we have:
\[
(100, 0, 200), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (200, 100, 0), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200).

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, which means \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, \(\omega\) satisfies the equation \(\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) modulo 1000. First, we simplify the expression inside the product. Notice that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity, so we can write \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k \mod 13}\).

The expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) can be rewritten as:
\[2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}.\]

We will evaluate this product by considering the polynomial whose roots are \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial is \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). We need to find the value of the product of the values of the polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\).

By Vieta's formulas, the product of the values of a polynomial \(Q(x)\) evaluated at the roots of another polynomial \(P(x)\) is given by \(Q(0)^{n} \cdot \text{(constant term of } P(x) \text{)}\), where \(n\) is the degree of \(P(x)\). However, in this case, we need to use a different approach because the roots are not simple.

Instead, we can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial evaluated at the roots of unity can be simplified using properties of roots of unity. Specifically, we can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial evaluated at the roots of unity is equal to the constant term of the polynomial raised to the degree of the polynomial, divided by the leading coefficient of the polynomial.

In this case, the polynomial \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) has a constant term of 2 and a leading coefficient of 1. The degree of the polynomial \(P(x)\) is 12, so the product of the values of \(Q(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(P(x)\) is:
\[2^{13} = 8192.\]

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 8192 is divided by 1000. We do this by performing the division:
\[8192 \div 1000 = 8 \text{ remainder } 192.\]

Therefore, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{192}\).","[192, '192']",321,"[321, '321']",False

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible configurations of the rectangles.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle in this context is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides or diagonals. This means we need to choose four vertices such that the line segments connecting them form a rectangle.

We can break this down into two cases:
1. The rectangle has sides parallel to the sides of the dodecagon.
2. The rectangle has sides parallel to the diagonals of the dodecagon.

**Case 1: The rectangle has sides parallel to the sides of the dodecagon.**

In this case, we need to choose two pairs of opposite vertices such that the line segments connecting them are sides of the rectangle. This is equivalent to choosing two pairs of opposite sides of the dodecagon. The number of ways to do this is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 pairs of opposite vertices from 12 vertices, which is given by:
\[
\frac{12}{2} \times \frac{10}{2} = 6 \times 5 = 30
\]

**Case 2: The rectangle has sides parallel to the diagonals of the dodecagon.**

In this case, we need to choose two pairs of opposite vertices such that the line segments connecting them are diagonals of the rectangle. The diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other. The possible lengths of the diagonals in a regular dodecagon are the distances between vertices that are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 vertices apart. However, the diagonals must be equal in length, so the only possible pairs are:
- Vertices 2 vertices apart: \( A_i, A_{i+2}, A_{i+4}, A_{i+6} \)
- Vertices 3 vertices apart: \( A_i, A_{i+3}, A_{i+6}, A_{i+9} \)
- Vertices 4 vertices apart: \( A_i, A_{i+4}, A_{i+8}, A_{i+12} \)
- Vertices 5 vertices apart: \( A_i, A_{i+5}, A_{i+10}, A_{i+15} \)
- Vertices 6 vertices apart: \( A_i, A_{i+6}, A_{i+12}, A_{i+18} \)

For each pair of opposite vertices, there is exactly one rectangle that can be formed. The number of ways to choose a pair of opposite vertices is 6 (since there are 12 vertices and each pair is counted twice). Therefore, the number of rectangles in this case is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36

Adding the number of rectangles from both cases, we get:
\[
30 + 36 = 66

Thus, the total number of rectangles that can be formed is:

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline

The two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
From this equation, we can see that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\).

Next, the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

From this equation, we can see that \(a + b + c = 9\) and \(d + e + f = 9\).

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \(a + d = 9\)
2. \(b + e = 9\)
3. \(c + f = 9\)
4. \(a + b + c = 9\)
5. \(d + e + f = 9\)

From equations 1, 2, and 3, we can express \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 9 - a, \quad e = 9 - b, \quad f = 9 - c
\]
Substituting these into equations 4 and 5, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 9
\]
\[
(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 9 \implies 27 - (a + b + c) = 9 \implies 27 - 9 = 9 \implies 18 = 9
\]
The second equation is always true given the first equation. Therefore, the only constraint is \(a + b + c = 9\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits from 0 to 9.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(a + b + c = 9\) is given by the ""stars and bars"" theorem, which is \(\binom{9+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{11}{2} = 55\).

For each solution \((a, b, c)\), there is a corresponding solution \((d, e, f) = (9-a, 9-b, 9-c)\). Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 55.

The final answer is:

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in its exponential form. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the equations. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:

\[
m + n = 39 + 4 = 43
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometry of the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \). The torus \( T \) is formed by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

When the torus \( T \) is in contact with the sphere \( S \) on its outer side, the outer tangent to the sphere \( S \) is along a circle with radius \( r_o \). Similarly, when the torus \( T \) is in contact with the sphere \( S \) on its inner side, the inner tangent to the sphere \( S \) is along a circle with radius \( r_i \).

First, let's determine the distance from the center of the sphere \( S \) to the center of the circle that forms the torus \( T \). This distance is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation:
\[ 11 + 6 = 17. \]

When the torus is in contact with the sphere on its outer side, the outer tangent to the sphere is along a circle that is 11 units away from the center of the sphere. The radius of this circle is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that forms the torus minus the radius of the circle that forms the torus:
\[ 17 - 3 = 14. \]
So, \( r_o = 14 \).

When the torus is in contact with the sphere on its inner side, the inner tangent to the sphere is along a circle that is 11 units away from the center of the sphere. The radius of this circle is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that forms the torus plus the radius of the circle that forms the torus:
\[ 17 + 3 = 20. \]
So, \( r_i = 20 \).

The difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 20 - 14 = 6. \]

Since 6 is already in its simplest form, we have \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 25 white and 25 black tokens in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one token, all tokens in the same row and all tokens in the same column have the same color, and adding any additional token would violate one of these conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations for the tokens. Each row and each column can either be empty or contain tokens of the same color. This means that the tokens form a collection of \(1 \times k\) or \(k \times 1\) blocks of the same color, where \(k\) is the number of tokens in that row or column.

We can represent each configuration by a pair \((w, b)\), where \(w\) is the number of rows (or columns) containing white tokens and \(b\) is the number of rows (or columns) containing black tokens. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, \(w\) and \(b\) can each range from 0 to 5, and they must satisfy \(w + b \leq 5\) because each row and each column can contain tokens of at most one color.

For each pair \((w, b)\), the number of ways to choose \(w\) rows out of 5 for the white tokens is \(\binom{5}{w}\), and the number of ways to choose \(b\) rows out of the remaining \(5 - w\) rows for the black tokens is \(\binom{5-w}{b}\). Similarly, the number of ways to choose \(w\) columns out of 5 for the white tokens is \(\binom{5}{w}\), and the number of ways to choose \(b\) columns out of the remaining \(5 - w\) columns for the black tokens is \(\binom{5-w}{b}\).

Therefore, the total number of configurations for a given pair \((w, b)\) is:
\[
\binom{5}{w}^2 \binom{5-w}{b}^2
\]

We need to sum this over all valid pairs \((w, b)\):
\[
\sum_{w=0}^{5} \sum_{b=0}^{5-w} \binom{5}{w}^2 \binom{5-w}{b}^2
\]

We can simplify this sum by recognizing that it is the expansion of \((1+1)^5 (1+1)^5 = 2^5 \cdot 2^5 = 32 \cdot 32 = 1024\).

Thus, the number of ways to place the tokens is:
