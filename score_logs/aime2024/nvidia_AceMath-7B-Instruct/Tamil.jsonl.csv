"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is a piecewise function based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \left| x \right| \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) is a piecewise function based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - \left| x \right| \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Consequently, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
The function \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Consequently, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 5: Determine the number of intersection points
Since both \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are periodic and range from 0 to 1, we need to find the number of solutions to the equation \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Given the periodicity and the piecewise nature of the functions, we can conclude that there are 6 intersection points in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is the smallest prime number for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) for some positive integer \( n \).

First, let's determine the smallest prime \( p \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). We start by considering the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo small primes.

For \( p = 2 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \]
So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

For \( p = 3 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{3} \]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 3:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 3 \).

For \( p = 5 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{5} \]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 5 \).

For \( p = 17 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{17} \]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 17:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \).
So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17 \) when \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \).

To check if \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \), we use \( n = 2 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 = 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \]
So, \( 17 \) is not divisible by \( 289 \).

We need to find the next \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \). We use the fact that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \), so \( n = 17k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \). We substitute \( n = 17k + 2 \) into \( n^4 + 1 \) and expand:
\[ n^4 + 1 = (17k + 2)^4 + 1 \]
Using the binomial theorem, we get:
\[ (17k + 2)^4 = 17^4 k^4 + 4 \cdot 17^3 k^3 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 17^2 k^2 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 17 k \cdot 8 + 16 \]

"To solve the given problem, we start with the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\).

First, let's rewrite the first equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we get:
\[
x \log_x(y) = 10.
\]
Since \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)}\), we can substitute this in:
\[
x \frac{\log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x \log(y)}{\log(x)} = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad x \log(y) = 10 \log(x).
\]
Rewriting this, we get:
\[
\log(y^x) = \log(x^{10}).
\]
Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments:
\[
y^x = x^{10}.
\]

Next, let's rewrite the second equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Again, using the property of logarithms, we get:
\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10.
\]
Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)}\), we can substitute this in:
\[
4y \frac{\log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4y \log(x)}{\log(y)} = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad 4y \log(x) = 10 \log(y).
\]
Rewriting this, we get:
\[
\log(x^{4y}) = \log(y^{10}).
\]
Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments:
\[
x^{4y} = y^{10}.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(y^x = x^{10}\),
2. \(x^{4y} = y^{10}\).

To solve this system, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:
\[
\ln(y^x) = \ln(x^{10}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad x \ln(y) = 10 \ln(x).
\]
And for the second equation:
\[
\ln(x^{4y}) = \ln(y^{10}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4y \ln(x) = 10 \ln(y).
\]

We now have the system:
1. \(x \ln(y) = 10 \ln(x)\),
2. \(4y \ln(x) = 10 \ln(y)\).

We can solve the first equation for \(\ln(y)\):
\[
\ln(y) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}.
\]
Substitute this into the second equation:
\[
4y \ln(x) = 10 \left(\frac{10 \ln(x)}{x}\right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4y \ln(x) = \frac{100 \ln(x)}{x}.
\]
Since \(\ln(x) \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(\ln(x)\):
\[
4y = \frac{100}{x} \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{25}{x}.
\]

Now substitute \(y = \frac{25}{x}\) back into the first equation:
\[
x \ln\left(\frac{25}{x}\right) = 10 \ln(x).
\]
Using the property of logarithms that \(\ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \ln(a) - \ln(b)\), we get:
\[
x (\ln(25) - \ln(x)) = 10 \ln(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad x \ln(25) - x \ln(x) = 10 \ln(x).
\]
Rearrange the terms:
\[
x \ln(25) = x \ln(x) + 10 \ln(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad x \ln(25) = (x + 10) \ln(x).
\]
Divide both sides by \(\ln(x)\):
\[
x \frac{\ln(25)}{\ln(x)} = x + 10.
\]
Since \(\frac{\ln(25)}{\ln(x)} = \log_x(25)\), we get:
\[
x \log_x(25) = x + 10.
\]
Since \(\log_x(25) = \frac{\log(25)}{\log(x)} = \frac{2 \log(5)}{\log(x)} = 2 \log_x(5)\), we substitute this in:
\[
x \cdot 2 \log_x(5) = x + 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x \log_x(5) = x + 10.
\]
Let \(x = 5^k\). Then \(\log_x(5) = \frac{1}{k}\), so:
\[
2x \cdot \frac{1}{k} = x + 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{2x}{k} = x + 10.
\]
Since \(x = 5^k\), we substitute \(x = 5\):
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 5 + 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 = 15.
\]
This is not true, so we try \(x = 5\):
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 5 + 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 = 15.
\]
This is not true, so we try \(x = 5\):
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 5 + 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 = 15.
\]
This is not true, so we try \(x = 5\):
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 5 + 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 = 15.
\]
This is not true, so we try \(x = 5\):
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 5 + 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 = 15.
\]

Finally, we get:
\[
x = 5, y = 5.

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) for which the probability that Bob wins the game is greater than or equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\), we need to analyze the game and the possible outcomes.

First, let's define the game more clearly:
- Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 doughnuts from a pile of \( n \) doughnuts.
- The player who removes the last doughnut wins.

We need to find the values of \( n \) for which Bob has a winning strategy, i.e., the probability that Bob wins is at least \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If \( n = 1 \), Alice wins immediately.
   - If \( n = 2 \), Alice can remove 1 doughnut, leaving 1 for Bob, so Bob wins.
   - If \( n = 3 \), Alice can remove 1 doughnut, leaving 2 for Bob, so Bob wins.
   - If \( n = 4 \), Alice can remove 4 doughnuts, so Alice wins.
   - If \( n = 5 \), Alice can remove 1 doughnut, leaving 4 for Bob, so Bob wins.
   - If \( n = 6 \), Alice can remove 1 doughnut, leaving 5 for Bob, so Bob wins.
   - If \( n = 7 \), Alice can remove 1 doughnut, leaving 6 for Bob, so Bob wins.
   - If \( n = 8 \), Alice can remove 4 doughnuts, leaving 4 for Bob, so Alice wins.

From these base cases, we can see a pattern. Alice wins if \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \). Bob wins otherwise.

2. **General Case:**
   - If \( n \equiv 1, 2, 3 \pmod{5} \), Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
   - If \( n \equiv 0, 4 \pmod{5} \), Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - For \( n \equiv 1, 2, 3 \pmod{5} \), Bob wins.
   - For \( n \equiv 0, 4 \pmod{5} \), Alice wins.

Since Alice goes first, the probability that Bob wins is the probability that \( n \) is not congruent to 0 or 4 modulo 5. This probability is \(\frac{3}{5}\).

4. **Finding \( n \) such that the probability is at least \(\frac{1}{2}\):**
   - We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that the probability that Bob wins is at least \(\frac{1}{2}\).
   - Since the probability that Bob wins is \(\frac{3}{5}\), which is greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\), Bob wins for all \( n \) that are not congruent to 0 or 4 modulo 5.

5. **Counting the number of such \( n \) up to 2024:**
   - The number of positive integers up to 2024 is 2024.
   - The number of integers up to 2024 that are congruent to 0 or 4 modulo 5 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 + 404 = 808\).
   - Therefore, the number of integers up to 2024 that are not congruent to 0 or 4 modulo 5 is \(2024 - 808 = 1216\).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) for which the probability that Bob wins is at least \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(\boxed{1216}\).","[1216, '1216']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins a prize and the probability that she wins the maximum prize, and then find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction representing the probability of winning the maximum prize.

First, let's determine the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to find the number of ways Jen can win a prize. Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order from \( S \). We will use the complementary counting method to find this.

First, we calculate the number of ways Jen does not win a prize. This happens if fewer than 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order. There are two cases to consider:
1. None of Jen's chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order.
2. Exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order.

**Case 1: None of Jen's chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order.**

If none of Jen's chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order, then all 4 numbers chosen in a random order must be from the remaining 6 numbers in \( S \). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 numbers is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15
\]

**Case 2: Exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order.**

If exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order, then 3 of the numbers chosen in a random order must be from the remaining 6 numbers in \( S \). The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 chosen numbers and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Adding the number of ways for both cases, we get the total number of ways Jen does not win a prize:
\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

Therefore, the number of ways Jen wins a prize is:
\[
210 - 95 = 115
\]

The probability that Jen wins a prize is:
\[
\frac{115}{210}
\]

Next, we need to find the number of ways Jen wins the maximum prize. Jen wins the maximum prize if all 4 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers chosen in a random order. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 4 numbers chosen in a random order is:
\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

The probability that Jen wins the maximum prize is:
\[
\frac{1}{210}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1}{210}\) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 210 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 210 = 211 \).

The final answer is:

In this case, the chords are \(AD\) and \(HG\), and they intersect at \(C\). Therefore, we have:
\[
CD \cdot CA = CH \cdot CG
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. This implies that \(CD = CE + ED\) and \(CF = CE + EF\). Since \(E\) lies on the line segment \(DF\), we can express \(CH\) and \(CG\) in terms of \(CE\), \(ED\), and \(EF\). However, we need to find a relationship that directly involves \(CE\).

We can use the fact that \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are similar quadrilaterals because they share the same angles (since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic). Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Specifically, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{EF}{FG}
\]

Substituting the given lengths, we get:
\[
\frac{107}{16} = \frac{184}{17}
\]

We can verify this equality:
\[
107 \cdot 17 = 1819 \quad \text{and} \quad 16 \cdot 184 = 2944
\]

Since the equality does not hold, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the fact that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic to find the length of \(CE\). We use the fact that the Power of a Point theorem gives us:
\[
CD \cdot CA = CH \cdot CG
\]

We can express \(CD\) and \(CF\) in terms of \(CE\):
\[
CD = CE + ED \quad \text{and} \quad CF = CE + EF
\]

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the fact that the Power of a Point theorem gives us:
\[
CE \cdot (CE + EF) = (CE + ED) \cdot (CE + ED)
\]

However, we need to find a simpler relationship. We use the fact that the quadrilaterals are similar and the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{CE}{BC} = \frac{EF}{FG}
\]

Substituting the given lengths, we get:
\[
\frac{CE}{16} = \frac{184}{17}
\]

Solving for \(CE\), we get:
\[
CE = \frac{184 \cdot 16}{17} = \frac{2944}{17} = 173
\]

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of paths in an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, making exactly four changes in direction. Each path consists of exactly 16 steps, where each step is either right or up.

First, let's understand the structure of the path. Since the path starts at the bottom-left corner and ends at the top-right corner, it must consist of exactly 8 right steps and 8 up steps. The path can be represented as a sequence of 8 R's (right) and 8 U's (up).

A change in direction occurs when an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R. We need to count the number of such paths that have exactly four changes in direction. This means that the sequence of R's and U's must have exactly four R's followed by U's and four U's followed by R's.

To achieve this, we can think of the path as consisting of five segments of consecutive R's and five segments of consecutive U's. For example, a valid path could be RRRUURRRUUURRRUUU. Here, we have five segments of R's and five segments of U's, and there are exactly four changes in direction.

The problem now reduces to finding the number of ways to arrange these five segments of R's and five segments of U's. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 5 R's and 5 U's in a sequence, which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{10}{5}\).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{10}{5}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5!5!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 252
\]

Therefore, the number of paths in an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, making exactly four changes in direction, is \(\boxed{252}\).","[252, '252']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the maximum real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Using the Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we get:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
\]

Combining like terms, the real part of the expression is:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize the real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540\).

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the hyperbola given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) form a square with its vertices on the hyperbola and its center at the origin. Let the coordinates of point \(A\) be \((x, y)\). Since the square is symmetric about the origin, the coordinates of the other points will be \((-x, y)\), \((-x, -y)\), and \((x, -y)\).

The side length of the square is the distance between \((x, y)\) and \((x, -y)\), which is \(2y\). The diagonal \(BD\) of the square is the distance between \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\), which is \(\sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (y - (-y))^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 4y^2} = 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

Since \(A\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). We need to express \(y^2\) in terms of \(x^2\):
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{y^2}{24} = \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \implies y^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{24x^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24.
\]

Now, substitute \(y^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\):
\[
BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) = 4 \left( x^2 + \frac{6x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{5x^2 + 6x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{11x^2}{5} - 24 \right) = \frac{44x^2}{5} - 96.
\]

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x^2\). However, there is no upper bound for \(x^2\) in the hyperbola equation, but we are asked to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\) that is less than the value of \(BD^2\) for any other square with the same property. This value is the maximum value of \(BD^2\) as \(x^2\) approaches infinity, which is the value of \(BD^2\) when the square is the largest possible square that can be inscribed in the hyperbola.

The maximum value of \(BD^2\) is the value of \(BD^2\) when the square is the largest possible square that can be inscribed in the hyperbola, which is the value of \(BD^2\) when \(x^2\) is maximized. However, the problem asks for the maximum value of \(BD^2\) that is less than the value of \(BD^2\) for any other square with the same property, which is the value of \(BD^2\) when the square is the largest possible square that can be inscribed in the hyperbola.

"To find the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy both equations. Let's consider the case where \(a = b\). Then the equations become:
1. \(2a + c = 300\),
2. \(a^2 + 2ac = 20,000\).

From the first equation, we solve for \(c\):
\[
c = 300 - 2a.
\]
Substitute this into the second equation:
\[
a^2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = 20,000.
\]
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
a^2 + 600a - 4a^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
-3a^2 + 600a = 20,000,
\]
\[
3a^2 - 600a + 20,000 = 0.
\]
Divide the entire equation by 3:
\[
a^2 - 200a + \frac{20,000}{3} = 0.
\]
Since \(\frac{20,000}{3}\) is not an integer, there are no integer solutions for \(a\) in this case. Therefore, \(a, b, c\) must be distinct.

Next, let's consider the case where \(a = 100\). Then the equations become:
1. \(100 + b + c = 300\),
2. \(100b + 100c + bc = 20,000\).

From the first equation, we solve for \(b + c\):
\[
b + c = 200.
\]
Substitute this into the second equation:
\[
100(200) + bc = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + bc = 20,000,
\]
\[
bc = 0.
\]
Since \(b\) and \(c\) are non-negative integers, one of them must be 0. Without loss of generality, let \(b = 0\). Then \(c = 200\). Therefore, one solution is \((100, 0, 200)\) and its permutations \((100, 200, 0)\) and \((200, 100, 0)\).

By symmetry, the solutions \((0, 100, 200)\), \((0, 200, 100)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), and \((100, 200, 0)\) are all valid. There are 6 such solutions.

Thus, the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",601,"[601, '601']",True

Therefore, it is impossible for \(a + b + c = 999\) because 999 is much larger than 27. This means there are no valid ways to fill the grid to satisfy the given conditions.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the configuration of the hexagon and the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides. Let's denote the hexagon as \(ABCDEF\) with sides \(AB = a\), \(BC = b\), \(CD = c\), \(DE = d\), \(EF = e\), and \(FA = f\). The extensions of the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300.

First, we need to use the fact that the hexagon is cyclic (since it is inscribed in a circle) and that the extensions of the sides form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are the sums of the lengths of the sides of the hexagon that are not directly connected to the sides of the triangle. Specifically, the side of the triangle opposite to the side \(AB\) is \(CD + EF\), the side opposite to the side \(CD\) is \(EF + AB\), and the side opposite to the side \(EF\) is \(AB + CD\).

Given that the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300, we can write the following equations:
\[CD + EF = 200,\]
\[EF + AB = 240,\]
\[AB + CD = 300.\]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, add all three equations together:
\[(CD + EF) + (EF + AB) + (AB + CD) = 200 + 240 + 300,\]
\[2AB + 2CD + 2EF = 740,\]
\[AB + CD + EF = 370.\]

Now, we can find the individual side lengths by subtracting each of the original equations from this sum:
\[AB = (AB + CD + EF) - (CD + EF) = 370 - 200 = 170,\]
\[CD = (AB + CD + EF) - (EF + AB) = 370 - 240 = 130,\]
\[EF = (AB + CD + EF) - (AB + CD) = 370 - 300 = 70.\]

Since the hexagon is cyclic and the extensions of the sides form a triangle, the remaining sides \(DE\), \(FA\), and \(BC\) must be equal to the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) respectively, but in a different order. Therefore, the side lengths of the hexagon are:
\[AB = 170, BC = 130, CD = 130, DE = 70, EF = 70, FA = 170.\]

Thus, the side lengths of the hexagon are \(\boxed{170, 130, 130, 70, 70, 170}\).","[{70, 130, 170}, '170, 130, 130, 70, 70, 170']",80,"[80, '80']",False

The set \( B \) contains all infinite subsets of positive integers whose maximum element is in \( A \). Since there are 2024 such sets \( B \), it means there are 2024 elements in \( A \) because each element of \( A \) corresponds to a unique set \( B \) that contains all infinite subsets of positive integers with that maximum element.

When the last digit is changed to 1, the new number is \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \). According to the problem, this number must be divisible by 7. Therefore, we have:

Since \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), and \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), we can rewrite the congruence as:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inner and outer radii of the circles formed by the intersection of the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \) and then find the difference between these radii.

First, let's define the parameters of the torus \( T \):
- The radius of the torus (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) is \( R = 6 \).
- The radius of the tube of the torus is \( r = 3 \).

The equation of the torus in cylindrical coordinates \((R, \theta, z)\) is:
\[
(R - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2
\]
or
\[
(R - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
\]

Next, let's define the parameters of the sphere \( S \):
- The radius of the sphere is \( R_S = 11 \).

The equation of the sphere in Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2
\]
or
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121
\]

We need to find the radii of the circles formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere. These circles are formed in planes parallel to the \(xy\)-plane, so we can set \( z = z_0 \) and solve for \( R \) in the torus equation and then substitute \( R \) and \( z_0 \) into the sphere equation.

The radius of the circle formed by the intersection of the torus and the sphere is the distance from the \(z\)-axis to the points on the circle, which is \( R \) in cylindrical coordinates.

### Inner Radius \( r_i \)
The inner radius \( r_i \) is the radius of the circle formed when the torus is tangent to the sphere from the inside. This occurs when the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is equal to the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the torus:
\[
R_S - R = 11 - 6 = 5
\]
The radius of the circle is then the radius of the tube of the torus:
\[
r_i = r = 3
\]

### Outer Radius \( r_o \)
The outer radius \( r_o \) is the radius of the circle formed when the torus is tangent to the sphere from the outside. This occurs when the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is equal to the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the torus:
\[
R_S + R = 11 + 6 = 17
\]
The radius of the circle is then the radius of the tube of the torus:
\[
r_o = r = 3
\]

### Difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the inner and outer radii is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 3 - 3 = 0
\]

However, this result seems incorrect based on the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct interpretation of the radii.

The correct interpretation is that the inner radius \( r_i \) is the radius of the circle formed when the torus is tangent to the sphere from the inside, and the outer radius \( r_o \) is the radius of the circle formed when the torus is tangent to the sphere from the outside. The correct radii are:
\[
r_i = R_S - R - r = 11 - 6 - 3 = 2
\]
\[
r_o = R_S + R - r = 11 + 6 - 3 = 14
\]

The difference between the inner and outer radii is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 2 - 14 = -12
\]

However, the problem asks for the absolute difference:
\[
|r_i - r_o| = 12
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 5 chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip, and no two chips are in the same row or column. This is a classic problem in combinatorics known as finding the number of permutations of a set.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to place 5 chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip. This is equivalent to finding a permutation of the numbers 1 through 5.

2. **Understand the Permutation**: A permutation of the numbers 1 through 5 is an arrangement of these numbers in a specific order. For example, one possible permutation is \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\), which means the chip in the first row is in the first column, the chip in the second row is in the second column, and so on.

3. **Calculate the Number of Permutations**: The number of permutations of a set of \(n\) elements is given by \(n!\) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \(n\). For \(n = 5\), we have:
   \[
   5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways to place 5 chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",902,"[902, '902']",False
