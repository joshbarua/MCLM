"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a regular octagon can be rotated such that all the black vertices map to positions of the original white vertices. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the vertices of the octagon can be partitioned into two sets of four vertices each, where each set is a rotation of the other.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to color the vertices of the octagon. Since each vertex can be either black or white, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of colorings that allow the octagon to be rotated such that all black vertices map to white vertices. This means that the vertices must be partitioned into two sets of four vertices each, where each set is a rotation of the other. In other words, the vertices must form two sets of four vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center of the octagon.

There are exactly 7 such partitions. To see why, consider the following:

1. Fix one vertex as black. There are 7 remaining vertices, and we need to choose 3 of them to be black to form a set of 4 black vertices. The remaining 4 vertices will automatically be white and form the other set.
2. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 7 is \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\). However, each partition is counted 8 times (once for each vertex in the set of black vertices), so we divide by 8 to get the number of distinct partitions: \(\frac{35}{8} = 4.375\). Since we are dealing with whole partitions, we need to consider the correct interpretation, which is that there are 7 distinct partitions.

Therefore, the number of valid colorings is \(7\).

The probability that a randomly chosen coloring allows the octagon to be rotated such that all black vertices map to white vertices is the ratio of the number of valid colorings to the total number of colorings:
\[
\frac{7}{256}
\]

Since 7 and 256 are relatively prime, the probability is in its simplest form. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:
\[
7 + 256 = 263
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{263}

"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the behavior of the functions \( f \) and \( g \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. The function \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will have a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \ldots \) and a maximum value of 1 at \( x = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \ldots \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \( g(1) = \left| \left| 1 \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{3}{4} \). The function \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will have a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \ldots \) and a maximum value of \( \frac{3}{4} \) at \( x = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \ldots \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 3. It will have a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \ldots \) and a maximum value of 3 at \( x = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \ldots \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \( \frac{2}{3} \) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to 1. The function \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \( \frac{3}{4} \). The function \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will have a minimum value of 0 at \( y = \frac{1}{6}, \frac{3}{6}, \frac{5}{6}, \ldots \) and a maximum value of \( \frac{3}{4} \) at \( y = 0, \frac{2}{6}, \frac{4}{6}, \frac{6}{6}, \ldots \).

### Step 7: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
The function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 3. It will have a minimum value of 0 at \( y = \frac{1}{6}, \frac{3}{6}, \frac{5}{6}, \ldots \) and a maximum value of 3 at \( y = 0, \frac{2}{6}, \frac{4}{6}, \frac{6}{6}, \ldots \).

### Step 8: Determine the number of intersection points
The graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are both periodic and symmetric. Each period of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) intersects each period of \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) exactly 6 times. Since both functions are periodic with period 1, there are 6 intersection points in each period.

Therefore, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or one of these factors must be divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let's check the smallest primes:

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]
   If \( n \) is odd, then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \). However, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \) is not divisible by \( 4 \). Therefore, \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{3}.
   \]
   If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \). If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \). If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 3 \).

3. **For \( p = 5 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{5}.
   \]
   If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 5 \).

4. **For \( p = 17 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{17}.
   \]
   If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17 \). We need to check if \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{17} \), then \( n = 17k + 4 \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 17k + 4 \) into \( n^4 + 1 \), we get:
   \[
   (17k + 4)^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 0 \pmod{289}.
   \]
   Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 289 \).

Thus, the smallest prime \( p \) is \( 17 \). Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We already know that \( m \equiv 4 \pmod{17} \) works. The smallest positive \( m \) is \( 4 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( n \) for which Bob has a winning strategy. Let's analyze the game step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Game
- There are \( n \) stones initially.
- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting.
- Each player can remove either 1 or 4 stones in their turn.
- The player who removes the last stone wins.

### Step 2: Identifying Winning and Losing Positions
We need to identify the positions where the player whose turn it is can force a win (winning positions) and the positions where the player whose turn it is will lose if the other player plays optimally (losing positions).

### Step 3: Base Cases
- If \( n = 0 \), the player whose turn it is loses (since there are no stones left).
- If \( n = 1 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing the last stone.
- If \( n = 2 \), the player whose turn it is loses because the only move is to remove 1 stone, leaving 1 stone for the other player.
- If \( n = 3 \), the player whose turn it is loses because the only move is to remove 1 stone, leaving 2 stones for the other player.
- If \( n = 4 \), the player whose turn it is wins by removing all 4 stones.
- If \( n = 5 \), the player whose turn it is loses because the only moves are to remove 1 or 4 stones, leaving 4 or 1 stones respectively for the other player.

### Step 4: Pattern Recognition
From the base cases, we can see a pattern:
- \( n = 0 \) (losing)
- \( n = 1 \) (winning)
- \( n = 2 \) (losing)
- \( n = 3 \) (losing)
- \( n = 4 \) (winning)
- \( n = 5 \) (losing)

The pattern suggests that the losing positions are \( n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, \ldots \). These positions can be described as \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

### Step 5: Generalizing the Pattern
The losing positions are \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \). Therefore, the winning positions are \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).

### Step 6: Counting the Winning Positions
We need to count the number of winning positions \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \).

- The number of integers \( n \) in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) that are \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).
- The number of integers \( n \) in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) that are \( \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024 - 1}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).
- The number of integers \( n \) in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) that are \( \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024 - 4}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).

Adding these together, the total number of winning positions is \( 404 + 405 + 405 = 1214 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{1214}\).","[1214, '1214']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. This involves two main steps:

1. Calculate the probability that Jen wins the main prize.
2. Calculate the probability that Jen wins a prize.
3. Use conditional probability to find the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability that Jen wins the main prize

Jen wins the main prize if all four of the numbers she chose are among the four numbers drawn. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{10}{4}\). Since there is only one way for Jen's chosen numbers to be the same as the drawn numbers, the probability that Jen wins the main prize is:
\[
P(\text{Main Prize}) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability that Jen wins a prize

Jen wins a prize if at least two of the numbers she chose are among the four numbers drawn. To find this probability, it is easier to first calculate the probability that Jen does not win a prize, i.e., the probability that fewer than two of her chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers. There are two cases to consider:

- **Case 1: None of Jen's chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers.**
  The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of the remaining 6 numbers is \(\binom{6}{4}\). Therefore, the probability is:
  \[
  P(\text{0 of Jen's numbers}) = \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14}
  \]

- **Case 2: Exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the drawn numbers.**
  The number of ways to choose 1 number out of Jen's 4 chosen numbers and 3 numbers out of the remaining 6 numbers is \(\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}\). Therefore, the probability is:
  \[
  P(\text{1 of Jen's numbers}) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \cdot 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21}
  \]

Adding these probabilities together gives the probability that fewer than two of Jen's chosen numbers are among the drawn numbers:
\[
P(\text{ fewer than 2 of Jen's numbers}) = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42}
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jen wins a prize is:
\[
P(\text{Prize}) = 1 - P(\text{ fewer than 2 of Jen's numbers}) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

### Step 3: Use conditional probability to find the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize

The conditional probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize is:
\[
P(\text{Main Prize} \mid \text{Prize}) = \frac{P(\text{Main Prize})}{P(\text{Prize})} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Thus, the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize is \(\frac{1}{115}\). The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 1 and 115, respectively, so \(m + n = 1 + 115 = 116\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of 16-unit long paths on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, changing direction exactly four times. Each path consists of a sequence of moves, either right (R) or up (U), and since the path is 16 units long, it must contain exactly 8 R's and 8 U's.

A path that changes direction exactly four times must have exactly four segments of consecutive R's and four segments of consecutive U's. This means that the sequence of moves can be represented as a permutation of the multiset \(\{R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\}\) where the R's and U's are grouped into four segments each.

To count the number of such permutations, we need to count the number of ways to arrange four R-segments and four U-segments in a sequence. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 4 R's and 4 U's in a sequence, which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\) is calculated as follows:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus inscribed in it. The equation of the hyperbola is:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

Since the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin and are perpendicular to each other, we can assume that the vertices of the rhombus are at points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((-x_2, -y_2)\). The diagonals of the rhombus are \(BD\) and \(AC\), where \(BD = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\) and \(AC = 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}\).

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) must satisfy the condition that the product of their slopes is \(-1\). However, since the rhombus is symmetric and the diagonals are perpendicular, we can simplify our analysis by considering the points \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\) on the hyperbola.

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:

\[
BD = 2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\):

\[
BD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)
\]

Since the point \((x, y)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

We can express \(y^2\) in terms of \(x^2\):

\[
y^2 = 24\left(\frac{x^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24}{20}x^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5}x^2 - 24
\]

Substituting \(y^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\):

\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x^2 + \frac{6}{5}x^2 - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11}{5}x^2 - 24\right) = \frac{44}{5}x^2 - 96
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x^2\). Since \(x^2\) can be arbitrarily large, the term \(\frac{44}{5}x^2\) will dominate, and \(BD^2\) will approach infinity. However, we are asked to find the largest value of \(BD^2\) that is less than a certain number. This implies that we need to consider the behavior of the hyperbola and the constraints of the problem.

Given that the hyperbola extends infinitely, the largest value of \(BD^2\) that is less than a certain number is not bounded. Therefore, the largest value of \(BD^2\) that is less than a certain number is:

"To find the number of non-negative integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We need to find non-negative integer solutions to this system. Consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a, b, c\):
\[
P(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = x^3 - (a+b+c)x^2 + (ab+bc+ca)x - abc = x^3 - 300x^2 + 20,000x - abc.
\]
We need to determine the value of \(abc\). To do this, we will check if there are any simple integer solutions that satisfy both equations.

Let's assume \(a = b\). Then the equations become:
1. \(2a + c = 300\),
2. \(a^2 + 2ac = 20,000\).

From the first equation, we solve for \(c\):
\[
c = 300 - 2a.
\]
Substitute this into the second equation:
\[
a^2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = 20,000.
\]
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
a^2 + 600a - 4a^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
-3a^2 + 600a = 20,000,
\]
\[
3a^2 - 600a + 20,000 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 3\), \(b = -600\), and \(c = 20,000\):
\[
a = \frac{600 \pm \sqrt{600^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 20,000}}{2 \cdot 3},
\]
\[
a = \frac{600 \pm \sqrt{360,000 - 240,000}}{6},
\]
\[
a = \frac{600 \pm \sqrt{120,000}}{6},
\]
\[
a = \frac{600 \pm 200\sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]
Since \(a\) must be an integer, and \(\sqrt{3}\) is irrational, there are no integer solutions for \(a\) in this case. Therefore, \(a = b\) does not yield any valid solutions.

By symmetry, the same argument applies if we assume \(b = c\) or \(c = a\). Therefore, there are no non-negative integer solutions to the system of equations.

"To determine how many rectangles can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle is either an edge or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the possible configurations of the vertices of the rectangle.

A rectangle in a regular dodecagon can be formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices. This is because the opposite sides of a rectangle must be equal and parallel, and in a regular dodecagon, the only way to achieve this is by selecting vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center of the dodecagon.

Let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12}\) in clockwise order. To form a rectangle, we need to choose two pairs of vertices such that the vertices in each pair are directly opposite each other. This means we need to choose two vertices \(A_i\) and \(A_{i+6}\) ( indices taken modulo 12), and then choose another pair of vertices \(A_j\) and \(A_{j+6}\) such that \(j \neq i\) and \(j \neq i+6\).

The number of ways to choose the first pair of opposite vertices is 6 (since there are 12 vertices, and each pair is counted twice). After choosing the first pair, there are 4 remaining pairs of opposite vertices to choose from for the second pair. Therefore, the total number of ways to form a rectangle is:

\[6 \times 4 = 24\]

Thus, the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon is \(\boxed{24}\).","[24, '24']",315,"[315, '315']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to place the digits 0-9 in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers read from left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers read from top to bottom is 99. Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The two numbers read from left to right are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:

\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]

From this equation, we can see that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\).

The three numbers read from top to bottom are \(100a + 10d + f\), \(100b + 10e + c\), and \(100c + 10f + d\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:

\[
(100a + 10d + f) + (100b + 10e + c) + (100c + 10f + d) = 99
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
100(a + b + c) + 10(d + e + f) + (f + c + d) = 99
\]

Since \(d + e + f = 9\) and \(c + f + d = 9\), we can substitute these values in:

\[
100(a + b + c) + 10(9) + 9 = 99
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
100(a + b + c) + 99 = 99
\]

Subtracting 99 from both sides, we get:

\[
100(a + b + c) = 0
\]

This implies that \(a + b + c = 0\). Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits, the only solution is \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), and \(c = 0\).

Given \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), and \(c = 0\), we have \(d = 9\), \(e = 9\), and \(f = 9\). Therefore, the only possible arrangement of the digits in the grid is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Thus, there is only one way to place the digits in the grid to satisfy the given conditions. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in its exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together. This gives:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the problem. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \left| \frac{39}{4} \right| = \frac{39}{4}
\]

The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 39 and 4, respectively. Therefore, \(m + n = 39 + 4 = 43\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) at which the torus \( T \) externally touches the sphere \( S \) from the inside and the outside, respectively. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

First, let's find the inner radius \( r_i \). The inner radius is the distance from the center of the sphere to the innermost point of the torus. The innermost point of the torus is located at a distance of \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units from the axis of rotation. Therefore, the inner radius \( r_i \) is:
\[
r_i = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

Next, let's find the outer radius \( r_o \). The outer radius is the distance from the center of the sphere to the outermost point of the torus. The outermost point of the torus is located at a distance of \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units from the axis of rotation. Therefore, the outer radius \( r_o \) is:
\[
r_o = 11 + 3 = 14
\]

The difference between the inner radius and the outer radius is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6
\]

However, the problem asks for the absolute difference, which is:
\[
|r_i - r_o| = 6
\]

The difference can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Here, \(m = 6\) and \(n = 1\), so:
\[
m + n = 6 + 1 = 7
