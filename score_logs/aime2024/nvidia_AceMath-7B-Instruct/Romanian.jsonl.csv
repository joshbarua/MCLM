"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time Aya spends pl limbare, including the time she spends at the café. We start by finding the distance Aya plimbare each day and then use the information about her travel times to find the time she spends pl limbare.

First, we know that when Aya travels at a speed of \( s \) km/h, her pl limbare takes 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes at the café. The time she spends pl limbare is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance she travels is given by:
\[
\text{Distance} = s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) \text{ km}
\]

Next, we know that when Aya travels at a speed of \( s + 2 \) km/h, her pl limbare takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes at the café. The time she spends pl limbare is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} - \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The distance she travels is given by:
\[
\text{Distance} = (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) \text{ km}
\]

Since the distance is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for the distance equal to each other:
\[
s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = (s + 2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)
\]

Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
4s - \frac{st}{60} = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60}
\]

We can cancel out the \(- \frac{st}{60}\) terms on both sides:
\[
4s = 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{2t}{60}
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
1.6s = 4.8 - \frac{2t}{60}
\]

Simplifying further, we get:
\[
1.6s = 4.8 - \frac{t}{30}
\]

Multiplying through by 30 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
48s = 144 - t
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( t \), we get:
\[
t = 144 - 48s
\]

Now, we need to find the time Aya spends pl limbare when she travels at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h. The time she spends pl limbare is given by:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right)}{s + \frac{1}{2}}
\]

Substituting \( t = 144 - 48s \) into the expression, we get:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{s \left( 4 - \frac{144 - 48s}{60} \right)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{s \left( 4 - 2.4 + 0.8s \right)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{s \left( 1.6 + 0.8s \right)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1.6s + 0.8s^2}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{0.8s(2 + s)}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{0.8s(2 + s)}{\frac{2s + 1}{2}} = \frac{1.6s(2 + s)}{2s + 1} = 1.6s
\]

The time Aya spends pl limbare is \( 1.6s \) hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:
\[
1.6s \times 60 = 96 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time Aya spends pl limbare, including the time she spends at the café, is:
\[
96 + t = 96 + 144 - 48s = 96 + 144 - 48 \times \frac{1}{2} = 96 + 144 - 24 = 216 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{216}

"To solve for \(AP\) in the given problem, we start by using the properties of the circle and the tangents. The point \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to the circle \(\omega\) at points \(B\) and \(C\). The line \(AD\) intersects the circle again at point \(P\).

First, we use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the power of the point with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of any secant line passing through the point. In this case, the power of point \(D\) is given by:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = DP \cdot DA
\]

Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), we have:
\[
DB = DC
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(D\) is the excenter of triangle \(ABC\) opposite to vertex \(A\). The lengths of the tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so:
\[
DB = DC = \frac{AB + AC - BC}{2} = \frac{5 + 10 - 9}{2} = 3
\]

Now, we need to find \(DA\). Using the Power of a Point theorem again, we have:
\[
DB^2 = DP \cdot DA \implies 3^2 = DP \cdot DA \implies 9 = DP \cdot DA
\]

Since \(P\) is the other intersection of \(AD\) with the circle, we can use the fact that \(AP\) is a chord of the circle. The length of \(AP\) can be found using the relationship between the segments of the secant line:
\[
DA = AP + PD
\]

Substituting \(DA\) in the Power of a Point equation, we get:
\[
9 = DP \cdot (AP + PD)
\]

We also know that \(DP = \frac{9}{DA}\). Substituting \(DA = AP + \frac{9}{DA}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
9 = \frac{9}{DA} \cdot (AP + \frac{9}{DA})
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
9 = \frac{9AP}{DA} + 9 \implies 0 = \frac{9AP}{DA} \implies AP = \frac{9}{2}
\]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{9}{2}\). The integers \(m\) and \(n\) are 9 and 2, respectively, and their sum is:
\[
m + n = 9 + 2 = 11
\]

"To determine the probability that an octagon with vertices colored either red or blue can be rotated such that all blue vertices move to positions initially occupied by red vertices, we need to consider the possible colorings of the octagon and the conditions under which such a rotation is possible.

First, let's denote the vertices of the octagon as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, A_8\) in a clockwise order. Each vertex can be either red (R) or blue (B), so there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings of the octagon.

For the octagon to be rotatable such that all blue vertices move to positions initially occupied by red vertices, the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, i.e., there must be exactly 4 blue vertices and 4 red vertices. This is because a rotation of the octagon by 45 degrees (i.e., one vertex) would map each blue vertex to a red vertex, and vice versa.

The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of 8 to be blue (and the remaining 4 to be red) is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{4}\):
\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70
\]

However, not all of these colorings will satisfy the condition that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices move to positions initially occupied by red vertices. We need to count only the colorings where the blue vertices are not in a pattern that cannot be rotated to match the red vertices. Specifically, the blue vertices must not form a pattern where they are all adjacent or form a pattern that cannot be rotated to match the red vertices.

The only patterns that do not satisfy this condition are the patterns where all blue vertices are adjacent. There are 8 such patterns (one for each starting vertex of the block of 4 blue vertices).

Therefore, the number of valid colorings is:
\[
70 - 8 = 62
\]

The probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices move to positions initially occupied by red vertices is the ratio of the number of valid colorings to the total number of colorings:
\[
\frac{62}{256} = \frac{31}{128}
\]

Since 31 and 128 are coprime, the probability is in its simplest form. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:
\[
31 + 128 = 159

Thus, the value of \(m+n\) is:

"To find the number of intersections of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to \(\frac{1}{2}\) as \( x \) moves away from \(\pm \frac{1}{2}\) to \(\pm 1\), and then remains constant at \(\frac{1}{2}\) for \( |x| \geq 1 \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to \(\frac{1}{4}\) as \( x \) moves away from \(\pm \frac{1}{4}\) to \(\pm \frac{1}{2}\), and then remains constant at \(\frac{1}{4}\) for \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 5: Find the intersections
We need to find the points \((x, y)\) that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Since both \( y \) and \( x \) range from 0 to 1, we need to consider the behavior of the functions within this interval.

The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) is periodic with period 1 and has a maximum value of 1 at certain points within each period. Similarly, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and has a maximum value of 1 at certain points within each period.

To find the number of intersections, we need to count the number of times the graphs cross each other within the interval \([0, 1]\). Since the functions are periodic and symmetric, we can use the fact that they intersect at the points where \( x = y \).

The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) intersects the line \( y = x \) at 6 points within the interval \([0, 1]\) (since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) completes 2 full cycles in \([0, 1]\) and each cycle intersects the line \( y = x \) twice). Similarly, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) intersects the line \( y = x \) at 6 points within the interval \([0, 1]\) (since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) completes 3 full cycles in \([0, 1]\) and each cycle intersects the line \( y = x \) twice).

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or their product must be divisible by \( p^2 \). This implies that \( p \) must be a prime that can be written in the form \( 8k + 1 \) or \( 8k + 3 \) or \( 8k + 5 \) or \( 8k + 7 \) (since these are the only primes that can divide \( n^4 + 1 \) for some integer \( n \)).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we use the property of logarithms that states \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). Applying this property to the first equation, we get:

\[
x \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Next, we use the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{\log_y(y)}{\log_y(x)} = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:

\[
x \cdot \frac{1}{\log_y(x)} = 10 \implies \frac{x}{\log_y(x)} = 10 \implies x = 10 \log_y(x)
\]

Now, we apply the same property of logarithms to the second equation:

\[
4y \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Solving for \(\log_y(x)\), we get:

\[
\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}

We substitute this expression for \(\log_y(x)\) back into the equation \(x = 10 \log_y(x)\):

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the other player plays optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.

Let's start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If there is 1 jeton left, the player whose turn it is will lose because they must take the last jeton.
- If there are 4 jetoane left, the player whose turn it is will lose because they must take the last jeton.
- If there are 2 jetoane left, the player whose turn it is can take 1 jeton, leaving 1 jeton for the other player, who will then lose.
- If there are 3 jetoane left, the player whose turn it is can take 1 jeton, leaving 2 jetoane for the other player, who will then lose.
- If there are 5 jetoane left, the player whose turn it is can take 1 jeton, leaving 4 jetoane for the other player, who will then lose.
- If there are 6 jetoane left, the player whose turn it is can take 1 jeton, leaving 5 jetoane for the other player, who will then lose.
- If there are 7 jetoane left, the player whose turn it is can take 1 jeton, leaving 6 jetoane for the other player, who will then lose.
- If there are 8 jetoane left, the player whose turn it is can take 4 jetoane, leaving 4 jetoane for the other player, who will then lose.

From this, we can see that the losing positions are the numbers that are congruent to 1 or 4 modulo 5. This is because any number of jetoane that is congruent to 1 or 4 modulo 5 will always leave the other player in a winning position.

To find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are congruent to 1 or 4 modulo 5, we can count the number of integers in each congruence class separately and then sum them up.

The number of integers less than or equal to 2024 that are congruent to 1 modulo 5 is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2024 - 1}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{2023}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405
\]

The number of integers less than or equal to 2024 that are congruent to 4 modulo 5 is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2024 - 4}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{2020}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405
\]

Adding these two counts together, we get:
\[
405 + 405 = 810

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{810}\).","[810, '810']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. This involves two main steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways Jen can win a prize.**
2. **Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize.**
3. **Use these to find the conditional probability and then sum the numerator and the denominator of the simplified fraction.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways Jen can win a prize

Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers match the 4 numbers drawn. We will calculate the total number of ways she can win by considering the complementary event (i.e., the number of ways she does not win a prize) and then subtracting from the total number of outcomes.

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

The number of ways Jen does not win a prize is the number of ways she has 0 or 1 match with the drawn numbers.

- **0 matches**: Jen chooses 4 numbers from the 6 numbers that were not drawn. The number of ways to do this is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]

- **1 match**: Jen chooses 1 number from the 4 drawn numbers and 3 numbers from the 6 not drawn. The number of ways to do this is:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of ways Jen does not win a prize is:
\[
15 + 80 = 95
\]

Therefore, the number of ways Jen wins a prize is:
\[
210 - 95 = 115
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize

Jen wins the grand prize if all 4 of her chosen numbers match the 4 drawn numbers. The number of ways this can happen is:
\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the conditional probability

The conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize is:
\[
P(\text{Grand Prize} | \text{Prize}) = \frac{P(\text{Grand Prize} \cap \text{Prize})}{P(\text{Prize})} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

### Step 4: Find \(m + n\)

In the fraction \(\frac{1}{115}\), \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\). Therefore:
\[
m + n = 1 + 115 = 116

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the shapes involved.

First, we note that \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles, and the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. Additionally, the points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle. This implies that quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic.

Given the dimensions:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

we can find the lengths of the other sides of the rectangles:
- \(AD = BC = 16\)
- \(CD = AB = 107\)
- \(EH = FG = 17\)
- \(GH = EF = 184\)

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the length \(CE\) can be found by considering the segments \(CD\), \(DE\), and \(EF\). We need to determine the length \(DE\).

Because \(A, D, H, G\) are cyclic, we can use the property that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to \(180^\circ\). Specifically, \(\angle ADH + \angle AGH = 180^\circ\).

Since \(AD\) and \(GH\) are parallel (both vertical sides of their respective rectangles), the angles \(\angle ADH\) and \(\angle AGH\) are supplementary. This confirms that \(ADHG\) is indeed cyclic.

Now, we can find \(DE\) by considering the total length from \(D\) to \(F\) through \(E\):
\[DF = CD + EF = 107 + 184 = 291\]

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the length \(CE\) is:
\[CE = DF - DE\]

However, we need to find \(DE\) first. We know that \(DE\) is the distance between the points \(D\) and \(E\) on the line segment \(DF\). Since \(D\) and \(E\) are on the same vertical line (as \(D\) is a vertex of rectangle \(ABCD\) and \(E\) is a vertex of rectangle \(EFGH\)), the length \(DE\) is the difference in the y-coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\).

Given that \(D\) is at the bottom of rectangle \(ABCD\) and \(E\) is at the bottom of rectangle \(EFGH\), the y-coordinate of \(D\) is 0 and the y-coordinate of \(E\) is the height of rectangle \(EFGH\), which is \(FG = 17\).

Thus, the length \(DE\) is:
\[DE = 17\]

Now, we can find \(CE\):
\[CE = DF - DE = 291 - 17 = 274\]

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is:

"To solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Path Representation**: Each path can be represented as a sequence of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. The total number of such paths without any direction change constraints is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\).

2. **Direction Change**: A direction change occurs when a right move is followed by an up move or vice versa. We need to count the number of paths where there are exactly four direction changes.

3. **Counting Paths with Direction Changes**: To have exactly four direction changes, we can think of the path as consisting of five segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, a path might look like RRRUURRRUUUUURRRU. Here, there are five segments: RRR, UU, RRR, UUUU, R.

4. **Choosing Segments**: We need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (since there are 15 places where a direction change can occur) to place the direction changes. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of 15, which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

5. **Assigning Moves to Segments**: Once we have chosen the positions of the direction changes, we need to assign the moves to the segments. There are 8 right moves and 8 up moves, and we need to distribute them among the segments. The number of ways to do this is given by the number of ways to partition 8 into 5 parts, which is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the ""stars and bars"" method.

However, a simpler approach is to note that the number of ways to assign the moves to the segments is simply the number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 16 for the right moves (or up moves), which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\).

6. **Combining the Results**: The total number of paths is the product of the number of ways to choose the positions of the direction changes and the number of ways to assign the moves to the segments. Therefore, the total number of paths is:
\[
\binom{15}{4} \times \binom{16}{8}
\]

However, we need to correct this because the number of ways to assign the moves to the segments is not simply \(\binom{16}{8}\). The correct approach is to use the fact that the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is given by the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15, which is \(\binom{15}{4}\).

"To find the maximum real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta.
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (348\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta)i.
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize the real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\).

Calculating \(R\), we get:
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

Thus, the maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) is \(R = 540\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of triangle \(ABC\) given the conditions about the circles tangent to its sides. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We have two sets of circles:
1. One set consists of 1 circle with radius 34 that is tangent to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\).
2. Another set consists of 2024 circles with radius 1 that are also tangent to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\).

### Step 2: Geometry of the Circles
The circle with radius 34 is tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\). The centers of the 2024 circles with radius 1 are arranged in a similar pattern, meaning they are also tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\).

### Step 3: Tangent Circles and Triangle Sides
The distance from the center of the larger circle to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) is 34. The distance from the center of each smaller circle to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) is 1. Therefore, the centers of the smaller circles are 33 units away from the center of the larger circle.

### Step 4: Arrangement of Smaller Circles
The 2024 smaller circles are arranged in a pattern where each circle is tangent to the next. This forms a regular polygon with 2024 sides, each side being the distance between the centers of two adjacent smaller circles.

### Step 5: Calculating the Distance Between Centers
The distance between the centers of two adjacent smaller circles is:
\[
2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ units}
\]

### Step 6: Perimeter of the Polygon
The perimeter \(P\) of the regular polygon with 2024 sides is:
\[
P = 2024 \times 2 = 4048 \text{ units}
\]

### Step 7: Radius of the Circumscribed Circle
The radius \(R\) of the circumscribed circle of the polygon is the distance from the center of the polygon to any of its vertices. This radius is also the distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of any smaller circle:
\[
R = 33 \text{ units}
\]

### Step 8: Area of the Polygon
The area \(A\) of a regular polygon with \(n\) sides and circumradius \(R\) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} n R^2 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)
\]
For \(n = 2024\) and \(R = 33\):
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 2024 \times 33^2 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{2024}\right)
\]

### Step 9: Approximating the Area
For large \(n\), \(\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right) \approx \frac{2\pi}{n}\):
\[
A \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 2024 \times 33^2 \times \frac{2\pi}{2024} = 33^2 \pi = 1089\pi
\]

### Step 10: Area of Triangle \(ABC\)
The area of triangle \(ABC\) is the sum of the areas of the larger circle and the 2024 smaller circles:
\[
\text{Area of larger circle} = \pi \times 34^2 = 1156\pi
\]
\[
\text{Area of 2024 smaller circles} = 2024 \times \pi \times 1^2 = 2024\pi
\]
\[
\text{Total area} = 1156\pi + 2024\pi = 3180\pi
\]

### Step 11: Expressing the Area as a Fraction
The area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(3180\pi\). Since \(\pi\) is a constant, we can express the area as:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{3180}{1}
\]
where \(m = 3180\) and \(n = 1\).

### Step 12: Sum of \(m\) and \(n\)
\[
m + n = 3180 + 1 = 3181

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus. The hyperbola is given by the equation:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

Since the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, the vertices of the rhombus can be represented as \(A(x_1, y_1)\), \(B(-x_1, -y_1)\), \(C(-x_1, y_1)\), and \(D(x_1, -y_1)\). The diagonals of the rhombus are \(AC\) and \(BD\), with lengths \(2y_1\) and \(2x_1\) respectively. The length of diagonal \(BD\) is \(2x_1\), so \(BD^2 = 4x_1^2\).

Since \(A(x_1, y_1)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the hyperbola's equation:

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

We need to express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):

\[
\frac{y_1^2}{24} = \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1
\]
\[
y_1^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1 \right)
\]
\[
y_1^2 = \frac{24x_1^2}{20} - 24
\]
\[
y_1^2 = \frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24
\]

Now, we substitute \(y_1^2\) back into the expression for \(BD^2\):

\[
BD^2 = 4x_1^2
\]

To find the maximum value of \(BD^2\), we need to consider the constraints given by the hyperbola. The term \(\frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24\) must be non-negative because \(y_1^2\) is a squared term and must be non-negative:

\[
\frac{6x_1^2}{5} - 24 \geq 0

\[
\frac{6x_1^2}{5} \geq 24

\[
6x_1^2 \geq 120

\[
x_1^2 \geq 20

The minimum value of \(x_1^2\) is 20. Substituting \(x_1^2 = 20\) into the expression for \(BD^2\):

\[
BD^2 = 4x_1^2 = 4 \times 20 = 80

- Let \( B \) be the set of locuitori who dețin a set of golf clubs.

- The number of locuitori who dețin a garden rake is \( |C| = 562 \).
- The number of locuitori who dețin a box of chocolates is \( |D| = 900 \) (since each locuitor deține one).
- The number of locuitori who dețin exactly two of these things is \( |A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C| - 3|A \cap B \cap D| - 3|A \cap C \cap D| - 3|B \cap C \cap D| + 6|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437 \).

We need to find the number of locuitori who dețin all four things, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets, we have:

Since every locuitor deține at least one of these things, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:

|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234

Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 2024 - 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) = 2024 - 900 - (437 + 3|A \cap B \cap C \cap D|) + (234 + 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D|) = 2024 - 900 - 437 + 234 + |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 921 + |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we can use the right triangle \( OIA \) to find the length \( IA \). The length \( IA \) is given by the formula:
\[

Substituting the values of \( R \) and \( OI \), we get:
\[
IA = \sqrt{13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2} = \sqrt{169 - 13} = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}

Using the identity \( \sin A = \frac{2r}{R} \), we get:

Since \( bc = 4R^2 \sin B \sin C \) and \( \sin B \sin C = \frac{r}{R} \), we have:
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{4R^2 \cdot \frac{r}{R}}{2r} = \frac{4R \cdot r}{2r} = 2R

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We need to find non-negative integer solutions to this system. Let's consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a, b, c\):
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0.
\]
To find possible values for \(a, b, c\), we can use the fact that \(a, b, c\) must be integers that satisfy both equations. Let's test some possible values.

First, assume \(a = 100\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 200,
\]
\[
100b + 100c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 200 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
100b + 100(200 - b) + b(200 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 200b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
200b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(200 - b) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 200\), and if \(b = 200\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\).

By symmetry, if we assume \(a = 200\), we get the solutions \((200, 100, 0)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\). And if we assume \(a = 0\), we get the solutions \((0, 100, 200)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), and \((100, 200, 0)\), which are already counted.

Thus, the distinct solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((200, 100, 0)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\), \((0, 100, 200)\). There are 6 such solutions.

Therefore, the number of triples of non-negative integers \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given equations is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The points \(A\) and \(B\) are given as \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line passing through these points is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), and substituting \(m = -\sqrt{3}\) and the point \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we consider a segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1, where \(P = (x, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, y)\). Since the length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1, we have:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
The point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) except \(\overline{AB}\) must be the point where the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) is tangent to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). To find this point, we substitute \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the circle's equation:
\[
x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1
\]
Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4 \implies 16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\):
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Since \(C\) is in the first quadrant, we take the positive root:
\[
x = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Substituting this value back into the equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\), we find \(y\):
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[
C = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)
\]
The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(3 + \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{39})^2}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{9 + 6\sqrt{13} + 13 + 3 - 2\sqrt{117} + 39}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{64}{64}} = 1
\]
Therefore, \(OC^2 = 1\), and the values of \(p\) and \(q\) are 1 and 1, respectively. The sum \(p + q\) is:

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by considering the properties of the 13th roots of unity. Let \(\omega\) be a primitive 13th root of unity, so \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity, so we can rewrite the product as \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

To simplify this, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). The product we need to evaluate is \(P(\omega)P(\omega^2)\cdots P(\omega^{12})\).

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) can be factored in terms of the roots of unity. Specifically, we can use the identity for the product of values of a polynomial evaluated at the roots of unity. For a polynomial \(Q(x)\) of degree \(n\), the product \(Q(\omega)Q(\omega^2)\cdots Q(\omega^n)\) is given by \((-1)^n Q(0)^n / a_n\), where \(a_n\) is the leading coefficient of \(Q(x)\).

In our case, \(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\), which is a quadratic polynomial with leading coefficient 1. Therefore, the product \(P(\omega)P(\omega^2)\cdots P(\omega^{12})\) is given by \((-1)^{12} P(0)^{12} / 1 = P(0)^{12}\).

Evaluating \(P(0)\), we get \(P(0) = 2\). Therefore, the product is \(2^{12}\).

Now, we need to find the remainder when \(2^{12}\) is divided by 1000. We calculate \(2^{12} = 4096\). The remainder when 4096 is divided by 1000 is \(4096 - 4 \cdot 1000 = 96\).

Thus, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{96}\).","[96, '96']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To find the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the conditions under which a number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = n \]
Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into the equation, we have:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( c \) to be an integer. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]
For \( c \) to be an integer, \( 4ab - 4a + 1 \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \):
\[ 4ab - 4a + 1 = k^2 \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = k^2 - 1 \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (k - 1)(k + 1) \]
Since \( k \) must be odd (because \( k^2 \) is odd), let \( k = 2m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2m + 1 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (2m)(2m + 2) \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = 4m(m + 1) \]
\[ a(b - 1) = m(m + 1) \]
This equation tells us that \( a(b - 1) \) must be the product of two consecutive integers. For each pair \((a, b)\), we can find the corresponding \( c \) and check if it is a valid digit in base \( b \) (i.e., \( 0 \le c < b \)).

To find the smallest \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to count the number of valid pairs \((a, c)\) for each \( b \). Let's start with small values of \( b \) and increase until we find the desired \( b \).

For \( b = 2 \):
\[ a = 1, \quad 1(2 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 1 \implies c = 1 \]
The only \( 2 \)-beautiful number is \( 11_2 = 3 \).

For \( b = 3 \):
\[ a = 1, \quad 1(3 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 1 \implies c = 1 \]
\[ a = 2, \quad 2(3 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 2 \implies c = 2 \]
The \( 3 \)-beautiful numbers are \( 11_3 = 4 \) and \( 22_3 = 8 \).

For \( b = 4 \):
\[ a = 1, \quad 1(4 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 1 \implies c = 1 \]
\[ a = 2, \quad 2(4 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 2 \implies c = 2 \]
\[ a = 3, \quad 3(4 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 3 \implies c = 3 \]
The \( 4 \)-beautiful numbers are \( 11_4 = 5 \), \( 22_4 = 10 \), and \( 33_4 = 15 \).

Continuing this process, we find that for \( b = 13 \):
\[ a = 1, \quad 1(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 3 \implies c = 3 \]
\[ a = 2, \quad 2(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 5 \implies c = 5 \]
\[ a = 3, \quad 3(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 7 \implies c = 7 \]
\[ a = 4, \quad 4(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 9 \implies c = 9 \]
\[ a = 5, \quad 5(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 11 \implies c = 11 \]
\[ a = 6, \quad 6(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 13 \implies c = 13 \]
\[ a = 7, \quad 7(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 15 \implies c = 15 \]
\[ a = 8, \quad 8(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 17 \implies c = 17 \]
\[ a = 9, \quad 9(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 19 \implies c = 19 \]
\[ a = 10, \quad 10(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 21 \implies c = 21 \]
\[ a = 11, \quad 11(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 23 \implies c = 23 \]
\[ a = 12, \quad 12(13 - 1) = m(m + 1) \implies m = 25 \implies c = 25 \]
The \( 13 \)-beautiful numbers are \( 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97, 109, 121, 133 \).

"To find the number of rectangles that can be formed in a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the vertices of the dodecagon**: A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, which we can label as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \).

2. **Understanding the structure of rectangles**: A rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of vertices such that the vertices are not adjacent and do not form a straight line. This means we need to select two pairs of vertices that are not directly connected by a side of the dodecagon.

3. **Counting the vertices**: We can choose any two vertices from the 12 vertices to form the corners of the rectangle. However, we need to ensure that the selected vertices do not form a side of the dodecagon.

4. **Choosing vertices**: Let's denote the vertices of the rectangle as \( A_i, A_j, A_k, A_l \) where \( i < j < k < l \). The vertices must be chosen such that the pairs \( (A_i, A_j) \) and \( (A_k, A_l) \) do not form sides of the dodecagon.

5. **Calculating combinations**: We can choose 4 vertices from the 12 vertices in \( \binom{12}{4} \) ways. However, we need to subtract the cases where the selected vertices form sides of the dodecagon.

6. **Excluding adjacent vertices**: The number of ways to choose 4 vertices such that at least one pair is adjacent can be calculated by considering the following:
   - If we choose 4 vertices, there are \( 12 \) ways to choose the first vertex, and then we can choose the next vertex in \( 11 \) ways, and so on. However, we need to ensure that we do not count configurations where vertices are adjacent.

7. **Using combinatorial arguments**: The total number of rectangles can be calculated by considering the number of ways to choose 4 vertices and then ensuring that they do not form sides of the dodecagon.

8. **Final calculation**: After performing the necessary calculations, we find that the total number of rectangles that can be formed is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of rectangles} = \binom{12}{4} - \text{(number of configurations with adjacent vertices)}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to place the digits 0 through 9 in a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column is 99.

Let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
The two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
From this equation, we can see that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\).

Next, the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]
From the previous equations, we know that \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), and \(f = 9 - c\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
10(a + b + c) + ((9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c)) = 99
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
\[
10(a + b + c) + 27 - (a + b + c) = 99
\]
This further simplifies to:
\[
9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99
\]
Subtracting 27 from both sides, we get:
\[
9(a + b + c) = 72
\]
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 8
\]

Now, we need to find the number of solutions to the system of equations:
1. \(a + d = 9\)
2. \(b + e = 9\)
3. \(c + f = 9\)
4. \(a + b + c = 8\)

Since \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), and \(f = 9 - c\), the first three equations are automatically satisfied if the fourth equation is satisfied. Therefore, we only need to find the number of solutions to \(a + b + c = 8\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers from 0 to 9).

The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(a + b + c = 8\) is given by the ""stars and bars"" theorem, which states that the number of solutions is \(\binom{8+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45\).

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in its exponential form. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the equations. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:

\[
39 + 4 = 43

Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the subsets \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as their maximum element are the subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i\} \) that include \( a_i \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{a_i-1} \) because we can either include or exclude each of the elements \( 1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1 \) in the subset.

Since the total number of subsets \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets for each maximum element in \( A \), we have:
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

To find the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), we need to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. First, we convert 2024 to its binary representation:
\[
2024_{10} = 11111101000_2
\]
This binary representation tells us that:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]
Thus, the exponents are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3. Therefore, the elements of \( A \) are:
\[
a_1 = 11, a_2 = 10, a_3 = 9, a_4 = 8, a_5 = 7, a_6 = 6, a_7 = 4
\]

The sum of the elements in \( A \) is:
\[
11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55
\]

Thus, the sum of the elements in \( A \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that if any one of its digits is replaced by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits, and \( a \neq 0 \) since \( N \) is a four-digit number.

First, consider the number \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \). If we replace the digit \( a \) with 1, the new number is \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \). This number must be divisible by 7. Similarly, if we replace the digit \( b \) with 1, the new number is \( 100a + 100 + 10c + d \), and this must also be divisible by 7. The same applies for replacing \( c \) and \( d \) with 1.

We can express these conditions mathematically as:
1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 100a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 100a + 10b + 100 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 100a + 10b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

First, simplify each congruence modulo 7:
1. \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), so \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \) or \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).
2. \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), so \( 2 + 2a + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \) or \( 2a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \).
3. \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), so \( 2 + 2a + 3b + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \) or \( 2a + 3b + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \).
4. \( 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \), so \( 1 + 2a + 3b + 3c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \) or \( 2a + 3b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \).

We now have the system of congruences:
1. \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 2a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 2a + 3b + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 2a + 3b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)

Subtract the first congruence from the second:
\[ (2a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) \equiv 5 - 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2a - 2b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ a - b \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ a = b + 2 \]

Subtract the first congruence from the third:
\[ (2a + 3b + d) - (2b + 3c + d) \equiv 5 - 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2a + b - 3c \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

Substitute \( a = b + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(b + 2) + b - 3c \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 4 + b - 3c \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3b - 3c \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv c \pmod{7} \]
\[ b = c \]

Substitute \( a = b + 2 \) and \( c = b \) into the fourth congruence:
\[ 2(b + 2) + 3b + 3b \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 4 + 6b \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 8b + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b = 2 \]

Thus, \( a = b + 2 = 4 \) and \( c = b = 2 \). The number \( N \) is \( 422d \). To maximize \( N \), we choose \( d = 9 \). Therefore, \( N = 4229 \).

Now, we need to find \( Q \) and \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000. Here, \( Q = 4 \) and \( R = 229 \). So, \( Q + R = 4 + 229 = 233 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometric configuration of the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \). The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

When the torus \( T \) is tangent externally to the sphere \( S \) along a circle, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle of tangency is equal to the sum of the radius of the sphere and the radius of the circle of tangency.

### Case 1: Torus tangent externally along a circle with radius \( r_i \)
In this case, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle that lies on the outer surface of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of this circle is \( 11 + r_i \).

The center of the circle of tangency is also the center of a cross-section of the torus that is a circle with radius 3. The distance from the center of the torus (which is the same as the center of the circle that the torus is rotated around) to the center of this circle is 6. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 + r_i - 3 = 8 + r_i \).

Since this distance is also equal to the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that the torus is rotated around, we have:
\[ 8 + r_i = 6 \]
\[ r_i = 6 - 8 = -2 \]

### Case 2: Torus tangent externally along a circle with radius \( r_o \)
In this case, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle that lies on the inner surface of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of this circle is \( 11 - r_o \).

The center of the circle of tangency is also the center of a cross-section of the torus that is a circle with radius 3. The distance from the center of the torus to the center of this circle is 6. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 11 - r_o + 3 = 14 - r_o \).

Since this distance is also equal to the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that the torus is rotated around, we have:
\[ 14 - r_o = 6 \]
\[ r_o = 14 - 6 = 8 \]

### Difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \)
The difference between \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = -2 - 8 = -10 \]

Since we are asked for the absolute value of the difference, we have:
\[ |r_i - r_o| = 10 \]

The fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) is \(\frac{10}{1}\), where \( m = 10 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 10 + 1 = 11 \).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 50 jetoane (25 white and 25 black) in the 25 cells of a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one jeton, all jetoane in the same row and all jetoane in the same column have the same color, and any additional jeton placed on the grid would violate one of these conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations of the jetoane on the grid. Since all jetoane in the same row and all jetoane in the same column must have the same color, the grid must be divided into two regions: one region containing white jetoane and the other region containing black jetoane. Each row and each column must be entirely white or entirely black.

This means that the grid can be in one of the following states:
1. All cells are white.
2. All cells are black.
3. The grid is divided into two regions by a horizontal line, a vertical line, or a combination of both.

Let's count the number of such configurations:

1. There is 1 configuration where all cells are white.
2. There is 1 configuration where all cells are black.
3. There are 4 configurations where the grid is divided by a single line (one horizontal and one vertical line, and their combinations).

Thus, the total number of configurations is:
\[1 + 1 + 4 = 6\]

Therefore, the number of ways to place the jetoane on the grid is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",902,"[902, '902']",False
