"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 0 \) when \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 1 \) when \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \( g(1) = \left| \left| 1 \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{3}{4} \). Specifically, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 0 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \frac{3}{4} \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 1 \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) ranges from 0 to 3. Specifically, \( y = 0 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( y = 3 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 1 \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Similarly, since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to 1, and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{3}{4}\).

### Step 7: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
The function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) ranges from 0 to 3. Specifically, \( x = 0 \) when \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( x = 3 \) when \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = 1 \).

### Step 8: Find the intersection points
The graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are both periodic and symmetric. Each period of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1, and within each period, both functions range from 0 to 3. The number of intersection points in one period can be found by considering the number of times the graphs cross each other.

Since both functions are continuous and piecewise linear, they will intersect at 4 points in each period. Therefore, the total number of intersection points is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or one of these factors must be divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let's test small prime numbers to find the smallest \( p \).

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2},
   \]
   so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 2 \).

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \). We can test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   &1^4 + 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &2^4 + 1 = 17 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &3^4 + 1 = 82 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &4^4 + 1 = 257 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &5^4 + 1 = 626 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &6^4 + 1 = 1297 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &7^4 + 1 = 2402 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &8^4 + 1 = 4097 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}.

   \]
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 9 \).

3. **For \( p = 5 \):**
   We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). We can test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 24 \):

   &9^4 + 1 = 6562 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
   &10^4 + 1 = 10001 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
   &11^4 + 1 = 14642 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\

   &24^4 + 1 = 331777 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 25 \).

4. **For \( p = 17 \):**
   We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \). We can test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 16 \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   &1^4 + 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &2^4 + 1 = 17 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &3^4 + 1 = 82 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &4^4 + 1 = 257 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &5^4 + 1 = 626 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &6^4 + 1 = 1297 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &7^4 + 1 = 2402 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &8^4 + 1 = 4097 \equiv 0 \pmod{289}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   So, \( n = 8 \) is a solution. Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) is \( 17 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We already know that \( m = 8 \) is a solution. To check if there is a smaller \( m \), we can test \( m = 1, 2, \ldots, 7 \):
\[
\begin{aligned}
&1^4 + 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&2^4 + 1 = 17 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&3^4 + 1 = 82 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&4^4 + 1 = 257 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&5^4 + 1 = 626 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&6^4 + 1 = 1297 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&7^4 + 1 = 2402 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}.
\end{aligned}
\]
So, the smallest positive integer \( m \) is \( 8 \).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation:

\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Since both expressions equal \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we can set them equal to each other:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the game and determine the winning strategy for Bob. The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a pile of \( n \) tokens. The player who removes the last token wins.

First, let's identify the winning and losing positions in the game. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Base Cases:**
   - \( n = 0 \): This is a losing position because there are no tokens left to remove.
   - \( n = 1 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove the last token.
   - \( n = 2 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent.
   - \( n = 3 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent.
   - \( n = 4 \): This is a losing position because the player can only remove 1 or 4 tokens, leaving 3 or 0 tokens respectively, both of which are winning positions for the opponent.
   - \( n = 5 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent.
   - \( n = 6 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the opponent.
   - \( n = 7 \): This is a winning position because the player can remove 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the opponent.
   - \( n = 8 \): This is a losing position because the player can only remove 1 or 4 tokens, leaving 7 or 4 tokens respectively, both of which are winning positions for the opponent.

From the above base cases, we can see a pattern. The losing positions are \( n = 0, 4, 8, 12, \ldots \), which are all multiples of 4. The winning positions are all other positive integers.

### General Strategy

The general strategy is that a player can always force the opponent into a losing position if the current position is a winning position. Specifically, if \( n \) is not a multiple of 4, the player can always remove either 1 or 4 tokens to leave a multiple of 4 for the opponent.

### Counting the Winning Positions for Bob

Bob wants to ensure that he wins the game, so he needs to start with a losing position. The losing positions are the multiples of 4. We need to count the number of multiples of 4 that are less than or equal to 2024.

The multiples of 4 less than or equal to 2024 are \( 4, 8, 12, \ldots, 2024 \). This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a = 4 \), the common difference \( d = 4 \), and the last term \( l = 2024 \).

The number of terms \( k \) in this sequence can be found using the formula for the \( k \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ l = a + (k-1)d \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 2024 = 4 + (k-1) \cdot 4 \]
\[ 2024 = 4 + 4(k-1) \]
\[ 2024 = 4k \]
\[ k = \frac{2024}{4} \]
\[ k = 506 \]

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{506}\).","[506, '506']",809,"[809, '809']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins a prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the main prize.

We need to find \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \]

Since winning the main prize implies winning a prize, \( B \cap A = B \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that Jen wins the main prize. Jen wins the main prize if she selects all 4 of the 4 randomly chosen numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} \). There is only 1 way for Jen to select all 4 of the randomly chosen numbers. Therefore, the probability \( P(B) \) is:
\[ P(B) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210} \]

Now, we calculate \( P(A) \), the probability that Jen wins a prize. Jen wins a prize if she has at least 2 of the 4 randomly chosen numbers. We will use the complement rule to find this probability. The complement of event \( A \) is the event that Jen has fewer than 2 of the 4 randomly chosen numbers. There are two cases to consider for the complement:
1. Jen has 0 of the 4 randomly chosen numbers.
2. Jen has 1 of the 4 randomly chosen numbers.

**Case 1: Jen has 0 of the 4 randomly chosen numbers.**
The number of ways for Jen to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 4 numbers are already chosen) is \( \binom{6}{4} \). Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} \]

**Case 2: Jen has 1 of the 4 randomly chosen numbers.**
The number of ways for Jen to choose 1 number from the 4 randomly chosen numbers and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers is \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} \). Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \cdot 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21} \]

Adding these probabilities together gives the probability of the complement of event \( A \):
\[ \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42} \]

Therefore, the probability \( P(A) \) is:
\[ P(A) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42} \]

Now, we can find \( P(B \mid A) \):
\[ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115} \]

The probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she has won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Since 1 and 115 are coprime, we have \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U).

A path that changes direction exactly four times must have exactly four segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, a valid path could be RRRRUUUU RRRRUUUU, which changes direction at the 4th and 8th moves.

To count the number of such paths, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's such that there are exactly four segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 4 dividers in the sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's to create 5 segments (since the first segment can be either R or U, and the last segment will be the remaining direction).

However, a simpler approach is to consider the number of ways to arrange the sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's such that there are exactly four changes in direction. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (since there are 15 possible places to change direction in a sequence of 16 moves) to place the changes in direction.

The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

Therefore, the number of such paths is:
\[
\binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4!(15-4)!} = \frac{15!}{4!11!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365

"To find the maximum possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the reciprocal \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting \(z\) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96+144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96+144i)e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Using the Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).

Expanding both terms, we get:

Combining like terms, the real part of the expression is:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]
To maximize the real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\) and \(\phi\) is an angle such that \(\cos\phi = \frac{324}{R}\) and \(\sin\phi = \frac{-432}{R}\).

Calculating \(R\), we get:
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

Thus, the maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) is \(R = 540\).

Since every obyvatel owns at least one of these items, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
\[
900 = 1924 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) + (|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|

We know that:
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - 3|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 437
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - 4|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 234
\]
Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
900 = 1924 - (437 + 2|A \cap B \cap C \cap D|) + (234 + 3|A \cap B \cap C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
Simplifying further, we have:
\[
900 = 1924 - 437 + 234 - 2|A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
\[
900 = 1721 - 2|A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
\[
2|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 821
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 410

"To find the number of non-negative integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to this system. Let's consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a, b, c\):
\[
P(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = x^3 - (a+b+c)x^2 + (ab+bc+ca)x - abc.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
P(x) = x^3 - 300x^2 + 20,000x - abc.
\]

To find the possible values of \(a, b, c\), we can use the fact that \(a, b, c\) must be non-negative integers that satisfy both equations. Let's test some possible values for \(a, b, c\).

First, assume \(a = 100\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 200,
\]
\[
100b + 100c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 200 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
100b + 100(200 - b) + b(200 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 200b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
200b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(200 - b) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 200\), and if \(b = 200\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\).

Next, assume \(a = 200\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 100,
\]
\[
200b + 200c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 100 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
200b + 200(100 - b) + b(100 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 100b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
100b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(100 - b) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 100\), and if \(b = 100\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\).

Finally, assume \(a = 0\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 300,
\]
\[
bc = 20,000.
\]
The solutions to this quadratic equation are:
\[
b, c = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 20,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]
So, \(b = 200\) and \(c = 100\), or \(b = 100\) and \(c = 200\). Therefore, the solutions are \((0, 200, 100)\), \((0, 100, 200)\), and \((200, 0, 100)\), which are already counted.

Thus, the distinct solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), \((0, 100, 200)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\). There are 6 such solutions.

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, i.e., \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the 12th degree polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the product becomes \((2-2\cdot1+1^2)\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

Next, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\). This can be done by considering the polynomial \(Q(x) = P(x)P(\omega x)P(\omega^2 x) \cdots P(\omega^{12} x)\) and evaluating it at \(x = 1\).

First, we express \(P(x)\) in a different form:
\[P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1.\]
Thus,
\[P(\omega^k) = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1.\]

We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1)\). This is a bit complex, so we use a known result from algebraic number theory that states that for a prime \(p\), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{p-1} P(\omega^k)\) for a polynomial \(P(x) = x^2 + ax + b\) with integer coefficients is given by \(P(1)^{p-1}\) if \(p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\) and \(P(1)^{p-1} \cdot (-1)^{(p-1)/2}\) if \(p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\). Here, \(p = 13\), so \(p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\).

Therefore, we have:
\[\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k) = P(1)^{12} = (1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2)^{12} = 0^{12} = 0.\]

Thus, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). According to the definition of a \( b \)-beautiful number, we have:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = n \]
Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into the equation, we obtain:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( c \) to be an integer. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]
For \( c \) to be an integer, \( 4ab - 4a + 1 \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \):
\[ 4ab - 4a + 1 = k^2 \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = k^2 - 1 \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (k - 1)(k + 1) \]
Since \( k \) must be odd (because \( k^2 \) is odd), let \( k = 2m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2m + 1 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (2m)(2m + 2) \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = 4m(m + 1) \]
\[ a(b - 1) = m(m + 1) \]
This equation tells us that \( a(b - 1) \) must be the product of two consecutive integers. For each pair \((a, b)\), we can find the corresponding \( c \) and \( n \) as follows:
\[ c = \frac{-(2a - 1) \pm \sqrt{4ab - 4a + 1}}{2} = \frac{-(2a - 1) \pm (2m + 1)}{2} \]
\[ c = m \quad \text{or} \quad c = -a + m + 1 \]
Since \( c \) must be a digit in base \( b \), \( 0 \le c < b \). Therefore, \( c = m \) and \( c = -a + m + 1 \) must both satisfy this condition.

Now, we need to find the smallest \( b \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers. We will check values of \( b \) starting from 2 and count the number of solutions for each \( b \).

For \( b = 2 \):

\[ a = 1, \quad a(b - 1) = 13 \]
The pairs are \((1, 13)\) and \((13, 1)\), so there are two \( 14 \)-beautiful numbers: \( n = 1 \cdot 14 + 13 = 27 \) and \( n = 13 \cdot 14 + 1 = 183 \).

For \( b = 15 \):
\[ a = 1, \quad a(b - 1) = 14 \]
The pairs are \((1, 14)\) and \((14, 1)\), so there are two \( 15 \)-beautiful numbers: \( n = 1 \cdot 15 + 14 = 29 \) and \( n = 14 \cdot 15 + 1 = 211 \).

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible configurations of the rectangles.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle in this context is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices such that the line segments connecting these pairs are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the possible pairs of opposite vertices:**
   - Each vertex \( A_i \) can be paired with another vertex \( A_j \) such that the line segment \( A_iA_j \) is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.
   - The possible values for \( j \) relative to \( i \) are \( i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4, i+5, i+6 \) (mod 12).

2. **Count the number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite vertices:**
   - We need to choose two pairs \((A_i, A_{i+k})\) and \((A_j, A_{j+m})\) such that \( k \) and \( m \) are both in the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) and the pairs are not the same or adjacent.
   - This is equivalent to choosing 4 vertices from the dodecagon such that no two chosen vertices are adjacent or directly opposite each other.

3. **Use combinatorial arguments:**
   - The problem of choosing 4 vertices from a dodecagon such that no two chosen vertices are adjacent or directly opposite each other is a well-known combinatorial problem.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by the formula for the number of ways to choose 4 vertices from a 12-sided polygon with the given constraints, which is 144.

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, is \(\boxed{144}\).","[144, '144']",315,"[315, '315']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to place the digits 0, 1, 8, and 9 into a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column is 99.

First, let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
The two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
From this equation, we can see that \(a + d = 9\), \(b + e = 9\), and \(c + f = 9\).

Next, the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]
From this equation, we can see that \(a + b + c = 9\) and \(d + e + f = 9\).

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \(a + d = 9\)
2. \(b + e = 9\)
3. \(c + f = 9\)
4. \(a + b + c = 9\)
5. \(d + e + f = 9\)

We can solve these equations step by step. From equations 1, 2, and 3, we can express \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
d = 9 - a, \quad e = 9 - b, \quad f = 9 - c
\]
Substituting these into equations 4 and 5, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 9
\]
\[
(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 9 \implies 27 - (a + b + c) = 9 \implies 27 - 9 = 9 \implies 18 = 9
\]
The second equation is always true given the first equation. Therefore, we only need to find the number of solutions to the equation \(a + b + c = 9\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits and can be 0, 1, 8, or 9.

We will consider all possible combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
- If \(a = 9\), then \(b + c = 0\). The only solution is \(b = 0\) and \(c = 0\).
- If \(a = 8\), then \(b + c = 1\). The solutions are \(b = 1\) and \(c = 0\), or \(b = 0\) and \(c = 1\).
- If \(a = 1\), then \(b + c = 8\). The solutions are \(b = 8\) and \(c = 0\), or \(b = 0\) and \(c = 8\).
- If \(a = 0\), then \(b + c = 9\). The only solution is \(b = 9\) and \(c = 0\), or \(b = 0\) and \(c = 9\).

Thus, the possible combinations of \((a, b, c)\) are:
\[
(9, 0, 0), (8, 1, 0), (8, 0, 1), (1, 8, 0), (1, 0, 8), (0, 9, 0), (0, 0, 9)
\]
There are 7 such combinations. For each combination of \((a, b, c)\), there is a corresponding combination of \((d, e, f)\) given by \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), and \(f = 9 - c\). Therefore, there are 7 valid ways to place the digits in the grid.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \) when it is on the inner and outer sides, respectively. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis in its plane that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

First, let's find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that generates the torus. This distance is 6 units. The radius of the circle that generates the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the minimum distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the torus is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units, and the maximum distance is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units.

When the torus is on the outer side of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency is the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the circle along which the torus is tangent. This distance is 11 units. Let \( r_o \) be the radius of this circle. Then, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of this circle is \( 11 - r_o \). Since the center of this circle is also 6 units away from the center of the sphere, we have:
\[ 11 - r_o = 6 \]
Solving for \( r_o \), we get:
\[ r_o = 5 \]

When the torus is on the inner side of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency is the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the circle along which the torus is tangent. This distance is 11 units. Let \( r_i \) be the radius of this circle. Then, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of this circle is \( 11 + r_i \). Since the center of this circle is also 6 units away from the center of the sphere, we have:
\[ 11 + r_i = 6 \]
Solving for \( r_i \), we get:
\[ r_i = -5 \]

The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = -5 - 5 = -10 \]

Since we are asked for the absolute value of the difference, we have:
\[ |r_i - r_o| = 10 \]

The problem states that \( r_i - r_o \) can be written as \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers. Here, \( m = 10 \) and \( n = 1 \), so \( m + n = 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 25 white and 25 black indistinguishable tokens into a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that:

1. Each cell contains at most one token.
2. All tokens in the same row and all tokens in the same column have the same color.
3. Any additional token placed on the grid would violate one or both of the above conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations of tokens in the grid. Since all tokens in the same row and all tokens in the same column must have the same color, the tokens must form a subgrid of the \(5 \times 5\) grid where all cells in the subgrid have the same color. The subgrid can be of any size from \(1 \times 1\) to \(5 \times 5\).

For a subgrid of size \(k \times k\), there are \((6-k)^2\) possible positions on the \(5 \times 5\) grid. Since the tokens can be either white or black, there are 2 choices for the color of the subgrid. Therefore, the number of ways to place a \(k \times k\) subgrid of tokens is \(2 \times (6-k)^2\).

We need to sum this over all possible values of \(k\) from 1 to 5:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{5} 2 \times (6-k)^2 = 2 \times (5^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = 2 \times (25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1) = 2 \times 55 = 110
\]

Thus, the number of ways to place the tokens is \(\boxed{110}\).","[110, '110']",902,"[902, '902']",False
