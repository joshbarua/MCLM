"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Aya spends walking and in the coffee shop, and then find the time she spends walking when her speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( s \) is the speed in km/h when Aya walks.
- \( t \) is the time in minutes spent in the coffee shop.
- The distance Aya walks is 9 km.

When Aya walks at speed \( s \) km/h, the time she spends walking is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours. The total time spent walking and in the coffee shop is 4 hours. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
Multiplying through by 60 to clear the denominators, we get:
\[
\frac{540}{s} + t = 240 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

When Aya walks at speed \( s + 2 \) km/h, the time she spends walking is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours. The total time spent walking and in the coffee shop is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]
Multiplying through by 60 to clear the denominators, we get:
\[
\frac{540}{s+2} + t = 144 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(\frac{540}{s} + t = 240\)
2. \(\frac{540}{s+2} + t = 144\)

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s+2} = 96
\]
Factor out 540 from the left side:
\[
540 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = 96
\]
Combine the fractions inside the parentheses:
\[
540 \left( \frac{(s+2) - s}{s(s+2)} \right) = 96
\]
Simplify the numerator:
\[
540 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 96
\]
Multiply both sides by \( s(s+2) \):
\[
1080 = 96s(s+2)
\]
Divide both sides by 96:
\[
11.25 = s(s+2)
\]
Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]
Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

Now substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{540}{2.5} + t = 240
\]
\[
216 + t = 240
\]
\[
t = 24
\]

Now, we need to find the total time Aya spends walking and in the coffee shop when her speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h. The time she spends walking is \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours, which is 180 minutes. The time she spends in the coffee shop is still 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time is:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time Aya spends walking and in the coffee shop when her speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.","[204, '204']",204,"[204, '204']",True

"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is a piecewise function:
- For \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( |x| < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - |x| \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also a piecewise function:
- For \( |x| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = |x| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( |x| < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - |x| \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will be:
- For \( |\sin(2 \pi x)| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = |\sin(2 \pi x)| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( |\sin(2 \pi x)| < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\sin(2 \pi x)| \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will be:
- For \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = f(\sin(2 \pi x)) - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) ranges from 0 to 1.

### Step 6: Analyze \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will be:
- For \( |\cos(3 \pi y)| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = |\cos(3 \pi y)| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( |\cos(3 \pi y)| < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \frac{1}{2} - |\cos(3 \pi y)| \).

### Step 7: Analyze \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\), \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will be:
- For \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = f(\cos(3 \pi y)) - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \frac{1}{4} - f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \).

### Step 8: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
The function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) ranges from 0 to 1.

### Step 9: Find the intersection points
The intersection points of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) occur when:
\[ 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi (4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))))))) \]

Since both functions are periodic and symmetric, we need to count the number of solutions in one period. The functions \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) have periods of 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\), respectively. The least common multiple of 1 and \(\frac{2}{3}\) is 2, so we consider the interval \([0, 2]\).

In each period of 1, there are 4 intersection points (2 from each function). Therefore, in the interval \([0, 2]\), there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) intersection points.

Thus, the number of intersection points is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
However, since we are dealing with integers, we need to find a factorization over the integers. We can use the Sophie Germain identity:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1).
\]
We need to find a prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Let's check the smallest primes.

For \( p = 2 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2},
\]
so \( 2 \) does not divide \( n^4 + 1 \) for any \( n \).

For \( p = 3 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{3}.
\]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 3:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
So, \( 3 \) does not divide \( n^4 + 1 \) for any \( n \).

For \( p = 5 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{5}.
\]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
So, \( 5 \) does not divide \( n^4 + 1 \) for any \( n \).

For \( p = 17 \):
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{17}.
\]
We check the values of \( n \) modulo 17:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \).
So, \( 17 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \). We need to check if \( 17^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \):
\[
n = 17k + 2 \implies n^4 + 1 = (17k + 2)^4 + 1.
\]
Using the binomial theorem, we expand \( (17k + 2)^4 \):
\[
(17k + 2)^4 = 17^4k^4 + 4 \cdot 17^3k^3 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 17^2k^2 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 17k \cdot 8 + 16.
\]
All terms except the last two are divisible by \( 17^2 \):
\[
(17k + 2)^4 + 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 17k \cdot 8 + 16 + 1 \equiv 544k + 17 \equiv 17(32k + 1) \pmod{17^2}.
\]
For \( k = 0 \), we get:
\[
(17 \cdot 0 + 2)^4 + 1 = 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17,
\]
which is not divisible by \( 17^2 \). For \( k = 1 \), we get:
\[
(17 \cdot 1 + 2)^4 + 1 = 19^4 + 1.
\]
We need to check if \( 19^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \):
\[
19 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \implies 19^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \pmod{17^2}.
\]
So, \( 17^2 \) does not divide \( 19^4 + 1 \). Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \) is \( 17 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \). We already know that \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \) is a solution. The smallest positive \( m \) is \( 2 \).

"To solve the given problem, we start with the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). We will convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). By the definition of logarithms, this can be rewritten as:
\[ x^{10} = y^x. \]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Similarly, this can be rewritten as:
\[ y^{10} = x^{4y}. \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( x^{10} = y^x \)
2. \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \)

To eliminate one of the variables, we can take the logarithm of both sides of each equation. Let's take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the first equation:
\[ \ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x). \]
Using the property of logarithms that \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\), we get:
\[ 10 \ln(x) = x \ln(y). \]
Rearranging this equation, we obtain:
\[ \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{10}{x}. \]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:
\[ \ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}). \]
Again, using the property of logarithms, we get:
\[ 10 \ln(y) = 4y \ln(x). \]
Rearranging this equation, we obtain:
\[ \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}. \]

Now we have two expressions for \(\frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)}\):
\[ \frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}. \]
To solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[ 50 = 2xy. \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ 25 = xy. \]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can always win the game, we need to analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if any move from that position leads to a winning position, and a winning position is one from which there is at least one move to a losing position.

Let's define the positions:
- \( W \) is a winning position.
- \( L \) is a losing position.

The game starts with \( n \) tokens. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. Therefore, the possible moves from a position \( n \) are to \( n-1 \) or \( n-4 \).

We need to find the pattern of winning and losing positions. Let's start with the smallest values of \( n \):

- \( n = 1 \): The player can only remove 1 token and win. So, \( 1 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 2 \): The player can only remove 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who will win. So, \( 2 \) is a losing position \( L \).
- \( n = 3 \): The player can only remove 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent, who will lose. So, \( 3 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 4 \): The player can remove 4 tokens and win. So, \( 4 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 5 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will win. So, \( 5 \) is a losing position \( L \).
- \( n = 6 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the opponent, who will lose. So, \( 6 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 7 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the opponent, who will win. So, \( 7 \) is a losing position \( L \).
- \( n = 8 \): The player can remove 4 tokens, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will win. So, \( 8 \) is a losing position \( L \).

From the above, we observe a pattern:
- \( n = 2, 5, 8 \) are losing positions.
- \( n = 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 \) are winning positions.

The losing positions are \( n = 2 + 3k \) for non-negative integers \( k \). We need to find the number of such \( n \) that are less than or equal to 2024.

The largest \( k \) such that \( 2 + 3k \leq 2024 \) is:
\[ 3k \leq 2022 \]
\[ k \leq 674 \]

Thus, \( k \) can take any integer value from 0 to 674, inclusive. Therefore, there are \( 675 \) losing positions.

The number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can always win is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the大奖 given that she wins a奖品. We will do this by first determining the total number of ways Jen can choose 4 digits from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \), and then finding the number of ways she can win a奖品 and the number of ways she can win the大奖.

### Step 1: Total Ways to Choose 4 Digits
The total number of ways to choose 4 different digits from the set \( S \) is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
\]

### Step 2: Ways to Win a奖品
To win a奖品, Jen must choose at least two of the digits that are randomly selected from \( S \). We will calculate the number of ways she can choose 4 digits such that at least two of them are from the randomly selected digits.

Let \( k \) be the number of randomly selected digits from \( S \). The number of ways to choose 4 digits such that at least two are from the randomly selected digits can be calculated using the principle of complementary counting.

1. **Total ways to choose 4 digits from \( S \)**: \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \)
2. **Ways to choose 4 digits with none from the randomly selected digits**: If \( k \) digits are randomly selected, then \( 10 - k \) digits are not selected. The number of ways to choose 4 digits from these \( 10 - k \) digits is:

\[
\binom{10-k}{4}
\]

3. **Ways to choose 4 digits with exactly one from the randomly selected digits**: The number of ways to choose 1 digit from the \( k \) randomly selected digits and 3 from the \( 10 - k \) non-selected digits is:

\[
\binom{k}{1} \cdot \binom{10-k}{3} = k \cdot \binom{10-k}{3}
\]

Thus, the total number of ways to win a奖品 is:

\[
\text{Ways to win a奖品} = \binom{10}{4} - \binom{10-k}{4} - k \cdot \binom{10-k}{3}
\]

### Step 3: Ways to Win the大奖
To win the大奖, Jen must choose all 4 digits from the randomly selected digits. The number of ways to choose 4 digits from \( k \) randomly selected digits is:

\[
\binom{k}{4}
\]

### Step 4: Conditional Probability
The probability of winning the大奖 given that she wins a奖品 is:

\[
P(\text{大将} | \text{奖品}) = \frac{P(\text{大将} \cap \text{奖品})}{P(\text{奖品})}
\]

Since winning the大奖 is a subset of winning a奖品, we have:

\[
P(\text{大将} \cap \text{奖品}) = P(\text{大将}) = \frac{\binom{k}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}}
\]

Thus, the conditional probability becomes:

\[
P(\text{大将} | \text{奖品}) = \frac{\frac{\binom{k}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}}}{\frac{\binom{10}{4} - \binom{10-k}{4} - k \cdot \binom{10-k}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}}} = \frac{\binom{k}{4}}{\binom{10}{4} - \binom{10-k}{4} - k \cdot \binom{10-k}{3}}
\]

### Step 5: Simplifying the Expression
To find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( \frac{m}{n} \) is in simplest form, we need to evaluate the expression for specific values of \( k \). However, since the problem does not specify \( k \), we can assume \( k = 4 \) for simplicity, as this is the maximum number of randomly selected digits.

Calculating for \( k = 4 \):

\[
\binom{4}{4} = 1, \quad \binom{6}{4} = 15, \quad \binom{6}{3} = 20
\]

Thus, the probability becomes:

\[
P(\text{大将} | \text{奖品}) = \frac{1}{210 - 15 - 4 \cdot 20} = \frac{1}{210 - 15 - 80} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

### Final Step: Finding \( m + n \)
Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore:

\[
m + n = 1 + 115 = 116
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{116}

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the shapes involved.

First, we note that \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles, and \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. Additionally, \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle. This implies that \(ADGH\) is a cyclic quadrilateral.

Given the dimensions:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

We can find the lengths of the other sides of the rectangles:
- \(AD = BC = 16\)
- \(CD = AB = 107\)
- \(EH = FG = 17\)
- \(GH = EF = 184\)

Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can express \(CE\) as the sum of \(CD\) and \(DE\). To find \(DE\), we use the fact that \(ADGH\) is a cyclic quadrilateral. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ADG + \angle AHG = 180^\circ\).

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the diagonals \(AG\) and \(DH\):
- \(AG = \sqrt{AD^2 + DG^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + 184^2} = \sqrt{256 + 33856} = \sqrt{34112} = 16\sqrt{134}\)
- \(DH = \sqrt{CD^2 + CH^2} = \sqrt{107^2 + 17^2} = \sqrt{11449 + 289} = \sqrt{11738}\)

Since \(A, D, H, G\) are cyclic, the power of point \(D\) with respect to the circle is equal to the power of point \(D\) with respect to the circle formed by \(A, D, H, G\). This gives us:
\[DE \cdot DC = DG \cdot DH\]
\[DE \cdot 107 = 184 \cdot \sqrt{11738}\]

However, we can simplify the problem by recognizing that \(DE\) can be found directly using the collinearity and the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \(DEF\):
\[DE = \sqrt{EF^2 - DF^2} = \sqrt{184^2 - 16^2} = \sqrt{33856 - 256} = \sqrt{33600} = 180\]

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is:
\[CE = CD + DE = 107 + 180 = 287\]

"To find the maximum possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). This is because the magnitude of \(z\) is 4, and any complex number on the circle of radius 4 can be written in this form.

First, we substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

We now expand each term separately:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + (75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)i) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i,
\]
\[
(24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i.
\]

Adding these two results together, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i.
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize this real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, and its maximum value is the magnitude of the vector \((324, -432)\):
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus \(ABCD\). The equation of the hyperbola is:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be expressed as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\) respectively. The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\), so \(BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\).

Since \(A\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the hyperbola's equation:

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

We need to maximize \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) under this constraint. To do this, we express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):

\[
y_1^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{24}{20} x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5} x_1^2 - 24
\]

Substituting this into \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\), we get:

\[
x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_1^2 + \left( \frac{6}{5} x_1^2 - 24 \right) = \frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24
\]

To maximize \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\), we need to maximize \(\frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24\). Since \(x_1^2\) can be arbitrarily large, the expression \(\frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24\) can also be arbitrarily large. However, we are asked to find the maximum value of \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) that is less than \(BD^2\).

Given that \(BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\), we need to find the maximum value of \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) such that \(4(x_1^2 + y_1^2) < 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\). This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

The correct interpretation is to find the maximum value of \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) that is less than the maximum value of \(BD^2\). Since \(BD^2\) can be arbitrarily large, the maximum value of \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) that is less than \(BD^2\) is the maximum value of \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) is:

"To find the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy these equations. Let's assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we have \(c = 300 - a - b\). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:
\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]
To find the possible values of \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the quadratic formula. However, a more practical approach is to test possible values of \(a\) and solve for \(b\) and \(c\).

Let's start with \(a = 100\):
\[
100^2 + b^2 + 100b - 300 \cdot 100 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
10,000 + b^2 + 100b - 30,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 200) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 0 = 200\). If \(b = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 200 = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\).

Next, let's try \(a = 200\):
\[
200^2 + b^2 + 200b - 300 \cdot 200 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
40,000 + b^2 + 200b - 60,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 100b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 100) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 0 = 100\). If \(b = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 100 = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\) and \((200, 100, 0)\).

Finally, let's try \(a = 0\):
\[
0^2 + b^2 + 0b - 300 \cdot 0 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 20,000}}{2}\), we get:
\[
b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]
So, \(b = 200\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 0 - 200 = 100\). If \(b = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 0 - 100 = 200\). Therefore, the solutions are \((0, 200, 100)\) and \((0, 100, 200)\).

Combining all the solutions, we have:
\[
(100, 0, 200), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (200, 100, 0), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200).
\]
There are 6 such solutions. Therefore, the number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",601,"[601, '601']",True

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is in contact with the sphere \( S \) when it is externally tangent to \( S \) in two different configurations. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Step 1: Determine the inner radius \( r_i \)
When the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \) along a circle that is closest to the center of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units. The radius of the sphere is 11, so the radius \( r_i \) of the circle on the torus is:
\[
r_i = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

### Step 2: Determine the outer radius \( r_o \)
When the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \) along a circle that is farthest from the center of the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units. The radius of the sphere is 11, so the radius \( r_o \) of the circle on the torus is:
\[
r_o = 11 - 9 = 2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the inner radius and the outer radius is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 8 - 2 = 6
\]

### Step 4: Express the difference as a fraction and find \( m + n \)
The difference \( 6 \) can be written as the fraction \( \frac{6}{1} \), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 25 chips (13 white and 12 black) in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and the same column have the same color, and adding any extra chip would violate one of these conditions.

First, let's consider the color pattern of the grid. Since all chips in the same row and the same column must have the same color, the grid must be divided into two distinct regions: one region for white chips and one region for black chips. Each region must form a rectangle (or a square) within the grid.

Given that there are 13 white chips and 12 black chips, the white chips must form a rectangle with 13 cells, and the black chips must form a rectangle with 12 cells. The possible dimensions of the rectangle for the white chips are \(1 \times 13\), \(13 \times 1\), \(2 \times 6\), \(6 \times 2\), \(3 \times 4\), and \(4 \times 3\). However, since the grid is \(5 \times 5\), the only possible dimensions are \(3 \times 4\) and \(4 \times 3\).

For each of these dimensions, we need to count the number of ways to place the rectangle in the grid. For a \(3 \times 4\) rectangle, there are \(3\) possible rows and \(2\) possible columns (since the rectangle must fit within the grid), giving us \(3 \times 2 = 6\) ways. Similarly, for a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, there are \(2\) possible rows and \(3\) possible columns, giving us \(2 \times 3 = 6\) ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the white chips is \(6 + 6 = 12\). Once the white chips are placed, the black chips must occupy the remaining cells, and there is only one way to do this.

Thus, the total number of ways to place the chips in the grid is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",902,"[902, '902']",False
