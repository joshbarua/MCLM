"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time \( t \) that Aya spends in the café when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour. We start by analyzing the given information and setting up equations.

First, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the walk and the break is 4 hours. The time spent walking is the distance divided by the speed, which is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours. The time spent in the café is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours (since \( t \) is in minutes). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]

Next, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the walk and the break is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours. The time spent walking is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours, and the time spent in the café is again \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \(\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4\)
2. \(\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4\)

We can eliminate \(\frac{t}{60}\) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
\left( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 4 - 2.4
\]
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]

To solve for \( s \), we find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side:
\[
\frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s(s+2)
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s
\]
\[
1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0
\]

We can simplify this quadratic equation by dividing every term by 1.6:
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-11.25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]

This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \quad \text{or} \quad s = \frac{-9}{2} = -4.5
\]

Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) kilometers per hour.

Now we substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4
\]
\[
t = 0.4 \cdot 60
\]
\[
t = 24
\]

Therefore, the number of minutes that Aya spends in the café when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) kilometers per hour is \(\boxed{24}\).","[24, '24']",204,"[204, '204']",False

"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will be 0 at \( x = \frac{k}{2} \) for integers \( k \) and will be 1 at \( x = \frac{2k+1}{4} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will be 0 at \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and will be 1 at \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 4. It will be 0 at \( x = \frac{k}{2} \) for integers \( k \) and will be 4 at \( x = \frac{2k+1}{4} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will be 0 at \( y = \frac{2k}{3} \) for integers \( k \) and will be 1 at \( y = \frac{2k+1}{6} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 7: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will be 0 at \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and will be 1 at \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 8: Find the intersection points
The intersection points of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) occur when both functions take the same value. Since both functions range from 0 to 4, we need to find the number of solutions to \( 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) for \( x \) and \( y \) in the interval \([0, 1]\).

Given the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, we can see that there are 12 intersection points in the interval \([0, 1]\) for both \( x \) and \( y \).

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide one of the factors \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) with multiplicity at least 2. This implies that \( p \) must be a prime number such that \( -1 \) is a fourth power residue modulo \( p \).

We will check the smallest prime numbers to find the smallest \( p \) that satisfies this condition.

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2},
   \]
   so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{3}.
   \]
   We check the values of \( n \) modulo 3:
   - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 3 \).

3. **For \( p = 5 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{5}.
   \]
   We check the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
   - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 5 \).

4. **For \( p = 17 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{17}.
   \]
   We check the values of \( n \) modulo 17:
   - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \).
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17 \) when \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \). We need to check if \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \) for \( n = 2 \):
   \[
   2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17,
   \]
   which is not divisible by \( 289 \).

   \[
   13^4 + 1 = 28561 + 1 = 28562,

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions.

First, let's define the positions:
- A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
- A position is a losing position if any move the player makes leaves the opponent in a winning position.

We start by identifying the base cases:
- If \( n = 1 \), the player who is about to move can take the last token and win. Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 2 \), the player who is about to move can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who will then win. Therefore, \( n = 2 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 3 \), the player who is about to move can take 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. Therefore, \( n = 3 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 4 \), the player who is about to move can take all 4 tokens and win. Therefore, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 5 \), the player who is about to move can take 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. Therefore, \( n = 5 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 6 \), the player who is about to move can take 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the opponent, who will then win. Therefore, \( n = 6 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 7 \), the player who is about to move can take 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. Therefore, \( n = 7 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 8 \), the player who is about to move can take 4 tokens, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. Therefore, \( n = 8 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 9 \), the player who is about to move can take 1 token, leaving 8 tokens for the opponent, who will then win. Therefore, \( n = 9 \) is a losing position.

From the above, we observe a pattern: the losing positions are \( n = 2, 6, 10, 14, \ldots \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and common difference 4. The general form of the \( k \)-th term of this sequence is \( 4k - 2 \).

To find the number of losing positions less than or equal to 2024, we solve the inequality:
\[ 4k - 2 \leq 2024 \]
\[ 4k \leq 2026 \]
\[ k \leq 506.5 \]
Since \( k \) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \( k \) is 506. Therefore, there are 506 losing positions less than or equal to 2024.

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Dzena wins the grand prize given that she has won some prize. We will do this by first determining the total number of ways Dzena can win some prize and then finding the number of ways she can win the grand prize.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways Dzena can win some prize

Dzena wins some prize if at least two of her chosen numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers. We will use the complementary counting method to find this.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways Dzena does not win any prize, i.e., the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that none of them are among the four randomly chosen numbers. This is equivalent to choosing 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of ways Dzena wins some prize is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} - \binom{6}{4} = 210 - 15 = 195
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways Dzena can win the grand prize

Dzena wins the grand prize if all four of her chosen numbers are among the four randomly chosen numbers. This is equivalent to choosing 4 numbers from the four randomly chosen numbers:
\[
\binom{4}{4} = \frac{4!}{4!0!} = 1

### Step 3: Calculate the conditional probability

The conditional probability that Dzena wins the grand prize given that she has won some prize is the ratio of the number of ways she wins the grand prize to the number of ways she wins some prize:
\[
\frac{\binom{4}{4}}{\binom{10}{4} - \binom{6}{4}} = \frac{1}{195}
\]

### Step 4: Find \( m + n \)

In the fraction \(\frac{1}{195}\), \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 195 \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 1 + 195 = 196
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of paths of length 16 from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), and we need to count the number of sequences of these moves that change direction exactly four times.

A change in direction means that a right move is followed by an up move or vice versa. Therefore, we need to find the number of sequences of 8 R's and 8 U's where there are exactly four changes in direction.

To do this, we can think of the sequence as a sequence of blocks of consecutive R's and U's. If there are exactly four changes in direction, then there must be exactly five blocks in the sequence (since each change in direction creates a new block). For example, a valid sequence might look like RRRUURRRUUUUURRRU.

The problem now reduces to finding the number of ways to arrange 5 blocks, where each block is either a sequence of R's or a sequence of U's, and the total number of R's and U's in all blocks is 8 each. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 5 blocks such that the sum of the lengths of the R blocks is 8 and the sum of the lengths of the U blocks is 8.

The number of ways to arrange 5 blocks of R's and U's is the same as the number of ways to arrange 4 changes in direction in a sequence of 16 moves. This is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{4}\), which represents the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 16 for the changes in direction.

However, we need to consider that each block can be either a sequence of R's or a sequence of U's, and the order of the blocks matters. Therefore, we need to multiply by the number of ways to arrange 5 blocks, which is \(2^5 = 32\).

Thus, the total number of paths is:
\[
\binom{16}{4} \times 32
\]

First, we calculate \(\binom{16}{4}\):
\[
\binom{16}{4} = \frac{16!}{4! \cdot 12!} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1820
\]

Next, we multiply by 32:
\[
1820 \times 32 = 58240
\]

Therefore, the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times is \(\boxed{58240}\).","[58240, '58240']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the maximum possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta.
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (336\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i.
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize the real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\).

Calculating \(R\), we get:
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) is \(R = 540\).

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the hyperbola given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The diagonals of the rhombus \(ABCD\) intersect at the origin, which means that the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are symmetric with respect to the origin. Therefore, if \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), then \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\), \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), and \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\).

Since \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation of the hyperbola:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1.
\]

The diagonals of the rhombus are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given by:
\[
BD = 2\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}.
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\).

To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we need to express \(y_2^2\) in terms of \(x_2^2\) using the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \implies y_2^2 = \frac{24}{20}(x_2^2 - 20) = \frac{6}{5}(x_2^2 - 20).
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_2^2 + \frac{6}{5}(x_2^2 - 20)\right) = 4\left(x_2^2 + \frac{6}{5}x_2^2 - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11}{5}x_2^2 - 24\right) = \frac{44}{5}x_2^2 - 96.
\]

To minimize \(BD^2\), we need to find the minimum value of \(\frac{44}{5}x_2^2 - 96\). Since \(x_2^2\) can take any value greater than or equal to 20 (from the hyperbola equation), the minimum value occurs when \(x_2^2 = 20\):
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44}{5}(20) - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80.

"To find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by rewriting the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]

Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation to get:

\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]

Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we find:

\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we need to find all non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to the system of equations:

1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We can assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we have \(c = 300 - a - b\). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:

\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation in \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]

To find the possible values of \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the discriminant of the quadratic equation in \(a\):

\[
a^2 + (b-300)a + (b^2 - 300b + 20,000) = 0.
\]

The discriminant \(\Delta\) of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square:

\[
\Delta = (b-300)^2 - 4(b^2 - 300b + 20,000) = b^2 - 600b + 90,000 - 4b^2 + 1200b - 80,000 = -3b^2 + 600b + 10,000.
\]

We need \(-3b^2 + 600b + 10,000\) to be a perfect square. Let's find the range of \(b\). The quadratic \(-3b^2 + 600b + 10,000\) is a downward-opening parabola, and its maximum value occurs at \(b = 100\):

\[
-3(100)^2 + 600(100) + 10,000 = -30,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 = 40,000.
\]

The quadratic must be non-negative, so we solve the inequality:

\[
-3b^2 + 600b + 10,000 \geq 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation \(-3b^2 + 600b + 10,000 = 0\) are:

\[
b = \frac{-600 \pm \sqrt{600^2 - 4(-3)(10,000)}}{2(-3)} = \frac{-600 \pm \sqrt{360,000 + 120,000}}{-6} = \frac{-600 \pm \sqrt{480,000}}{-6} = \frac{-600 \pm 400\sqrt{3}}{-6}.
\]

Approximating the roots, we get:

\[
b \approx \frac{-600 \pm 692.82}{-6} \approx 22.14 \text{ or } 217.86.
\]

Thus, \(b\) must be an integer in the range \(22 \leq b \leq 217\). For each \(b\) in this range, we solve the quadratic equation for \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{300 - b \pm \sqrt{-3b^2 + 600b + 10,000}}{2}.
\]

Since \(a\) must be a non-negative integer, we check each \(b\) to see if the discriminant is a perfect square and if the resulting \(a\) is an integer. After checking, we find that the only solutions are \((a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100)\).

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, i.e., \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). First, observe that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity, so \(\omega^{2k} = \omega^m\) for some \(m \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\}\). The polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) is symmetric, and the expression \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) can be rewritten in terms of \(\omega^k\).

Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the product \(P(\omega^0) P(\omega^1) P(\omega^2) \cdots P(\omega^{12})\). Notice that \(P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1\), so \(P(\omega^k) = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\).

To simplify the product, we use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) can be factored over the complex numbers as \((x - \omega)(x - \omega^2) \cdots (x - \omega^{12})\). Therefore, the product we are interested in is the value of the polynomial \(Q(x) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} P(x)\) evaluated at \(x = 1\).

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of unity can be found using properties of symmetric polynomials and the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) is irreducible over the integers.

By direct computation or using known results, it is found that the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 13^3 = 2197\). To find the remainder when 2197 is divided by 1000, we compute \(2197 \mod 1000\).

"To determine the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the conditions under which a number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) has two digits in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) such that \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into the equation, we get:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{ab + c} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + (2a - 1)c + c^2 - ab = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( c \) to be an integer. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]
For \( c \) to be an integer, \( 4ab - 4a + 1 \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \):
\[ 4ab - 4a + 1 = k^2 \]
Rearranging, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = k^2 - 1 \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (k - 1)(k + 1) \]
Since \( k \) must be odd (because \( k^2 \) is odd), let \( k = 2m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2m + 1 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4a(b - 1) = (2m)(2m + 2) \]
\[ 4a(b - 1) = 4m(m + 1) \]
\[ a(b - 1) = m(m + 1) \]
This equation tells us that \( a(b - 1) \) must be the product of two consecutive integers. For each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \), there is a corresponding \( m \) such that \( m(m + 1) = a(b - 1) \). The number of solutions \( m \) is equal to the number of ways to write \( a(b - 1) \) as a product of two consecutive integers, which is always 1.

Therefore, for each \( a \) from 1 to \( b-1 \), there is exactly one corresponding \( c \) that satisfies the equation \( a + c = \sqrt{ab + c} \). This means there are \( b-1 \) \( b \)-beautiful numbers.

We need to find the smallest \( b \) such that \( b-1 > 10 \):

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible configurations of the rectangles.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle in this context is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides (or diagonals) of the dodecagon. This means we need to choose four vertices such that the line segments connecting them form a rectangle.

The key observation is that the vertices of the rectangle must be chosen such that the arcs between them (in either direction) are equal. This is because the sides of the rectangle must be parallel and equal in length, which is only possible if the vertices are symmetrically placed around the dodecagon.

Let's consider the possible configurations:
1. The vertices are chosen such that the arcs between them are 2, 2, 2, and 6 (or any permutation thereof).
2. The vertices are chosen such that the arcs between them are 1, 1, 5, and 5 (or any permutation thereof).
3. The vertices are chosen such that the arcs between them are 3, 3, 3, and 3.

For the first configuration (2, 2, 2, 6), we can choose any starting vertex \( A_i \) and then choose the next vertices \( A_{i+2} \), \( A_{i+4} \), and \( A_{i+6} \). This gives us 12 possible rectangles.

For the second configuration (1, 1, 5, 5), we can choose any starting vertex \( A_i \) and then choose the next vertices \( A_{i+1} \), \( A_{i+2} \), \( A_{i+7} \), and \( A_{i+8} \). This also gives us 12 possible rectangles.

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometric configuration of the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \). The torus \( T \) is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

First, let's determine the inner and outer radii of the torus \( T \):
- The inner radius \( r_i \) is the distance from the center of the torus to the inner surface of the torus, which is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \).
- The outer radius \( r_o \) is the distance from the center of the torus to the outer surface of the torus, which is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \).

Next, we need to find the radii of the circles of tangency between the torus and the sphere \( S \) when the torus is in its inner and outer positions.

### Inner Position
When the torus is in its inner position, the center of the torus is at a distance of 3 units from the center of the sphere. The radius of the circle of tangency \( r_i \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner surface of the torus minus the radius of the sphere:
\[
r_i = 11 - (6 - 3) = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

### Outer Position
When the torus is in its outer position, the center of the torus is at a distance of 9 units from the center of the sphere. The radius of the circle of tangency \( r_o \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus minus the radius of the sphere:
\[
r_o = 11 - (6 + 3) = 11 - 9 = 2
\]

### Difference Between the Radii
The difference between the inner and outer radii of the circles of tangency is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 8 - 2 = 6
\]

Thus, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) can be written as \(\frac{6}{1}\), where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 6 + 1 = 7 \).

First, let's consider the possible configurations. Since all chips in a row and all chips in a column must have the same color, the entire grid must be filled with either all white chips or all black chips. This is because if there were any row or column with a mix of colors, adding a chip of the same color to that row or column would not violate the conditions, which contradicts the requirement that adding any additional chip would violate one or both conditions.

Therefore, there are only two possible configurations:
1. The entire grid is filled with white chips.
2. The entire grid is filled with black chips.

Each of these configurations satisfies all the given conditions. There are no other possible configurations because any other configuration would either have a row or column with a mix of colors, allowing for the addition of another chip without violating the conditions.
