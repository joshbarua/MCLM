"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Aya to travel 9 kilometers, including the time spent in the coffee shop, when she drives at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) kilometers per hour. We will use the information given for the other two speeds to find the values of \( s \) and \( t \).

First, let's denote the time spent driving as \( T \) hours. The total time for the trip, including the time spent in the coffee shop, is \( T + \frac{t}{60} \) hours.

### Step 1: Set up the equations for the given speeds
1. When Aya drives at \( s \) kilometers per hour, the driving time is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours. The total time is \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \) hours, which is given as 4 hours:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]
2. When Aya drives at \( s + 2 \) kilometers per hour, the driving time is \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours. The total time is \( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \) hours, which is given as 2 hours and 24 minutes, or 2.4 hours:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations
First, isolate \( \frac{t}{60} \) in both equations:
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 4 - \frac{9}{s}
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \frac{9}{s+2}
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \( \frac{t}{60} \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
4 - \frac{9}{s} = 2.4 - \frac{9}{s+2}
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving \( s \):
\[
4 - 2.4 = \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2}
\]
\[
1.6 = \frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)}
\]
\[
1.6 = \frac{18}{s(s+2)}
\]

Multiply both sides by \( s(s+2) \):
\[
1.6s(s+2) = 18
\]
\[
1.6s^2 + 3.2s = 18
\]
\[
16s^2 + 32s = 180
\]
\[
8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0
\]
\[
4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
\]

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -45 \):
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-45)}}{2 \cdot 4}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8}
\]
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
\]

This gives us two possible solutions:
\[
s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \quad \text{(since speed cannot be negative, we discard the other solution)}
\]

### Step 3: Find the value of \( t \)
Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4
\]
\[
t = 24
\]

### Step 4: Determine the time for the new speed
Now, we need to find the time it takes for Aya to travel 9 kilometers at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) kilometers per hour, including the time spent in the coffee shop:
\[
\text{Driving time} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 3 + \frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Time in minutes} = 3.4 \times 60 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the number of minutes Aya spends on the trip, including the time spent in the coffee shop, is \(\boxed{204}\).","[204, '204']",204,"[204, '204']",True

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon can be rotated such that all its blue vertices are in their original positions, given that each vertex is colored either blue or black with equal probability.

First, let's consider the total number of possible colorings of the octagon. Since there are 8 vertices and each vertex can be either blue or black, the total number of colorings is:
\[ 2^8 = 256. \]

Next, we need to count the number of colorings for which the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices are in their original positions. This means that the number of blue vertices must be a multiple of 8 (since rotating the octagon by any number of vertices that is not a multiple of 8 will not keep all blue vertices in their original positions). The only possible number of blue vertices that satisfies this condition is 0 or 8.

1. If there are 0 blue vertices, there is only 1 coloring (all vertices are black).
2. If there are 8 blue vertices, there is only 1 coloring (all vertices are blue).

Therefore, the total number of favorable colorings is:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2. \]

The probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all its blue vertices are in their original positions is the ratio of the number of favorable colorings to the total number of colorings:
\[ \frac{2}{256} = \frac{1}{128}. \]

In this fraction, the numerator \( m \) is 1 and the denominator \( n \) is 128. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are relatively prime, we have:
\[ m + n = 1 + 128 = 129. \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{129}. \]","[129, '129']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"To determine the number of points of intersection of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = x - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \frac{1}{2} - x \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < 0 \), \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \frac{1}{2} + x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = -x - \frac{1}{2} \).

Thus, \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = x - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{1}{4} - x \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq x < 0 \), \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{1}{4} + x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = -x - \frac{1}{4} \).

Thus, \( g(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 5: Find the points of intersection
The graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are both symmetric about the line \( y = x \) and range from 0 to 1. To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]

Since both functions are symmetric and periodic, we can consider the interval \([0, 1]\) and find the number of solutions. By symmetry and periodicity, there will be 6 points of intersection in the interval \([0, 1]\) for each variable, giving a total of 6 points of intersection.

Thus, the number of points of intersection is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or one of these factors must be divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let's check the smallest primes. If \( p = 2 \), then:
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{4}.
\]
For \( n \) even, \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \). For \( n \) odd, \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 4 \).

Next, let's check \( p = 3 \). We need to find \( n \) such that:
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}.
\]
We can check the values of \( n \) modulo 9:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\
&1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{9}, \\
&2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}, \\
&3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\
&4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 5 \pmod{9}, \\
&5^4 + 1 \equiv 625 + 1 \equiv 626 \equiv 5 \pmod{9}, \\
&6^4 + 1 \equiv 1296 + 1 \equiv 1297 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\
&7^4 + 1 \equiv 2401 + 1 \equiv 2402 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}, \\
&8^4 + 1 \equiv 4096 + 1 \equiv 4097 \equiv 2 \pmod{9}.
\end{aligned}
\]
None of these values are congruent to 0 modulo 9, so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 9 \).

Next, let's check \( p = 5 \). We need to find \( n \) such that:
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
\]
We can check the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}, \\
&1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}, \\
&2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}, \\
&3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}, \\
&4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}.
\end{aligned}
\]
None of these values are congruent to 0 modulo 5, so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 5 \).

Finally, let's check \( p = 17 \). We need to find \( n \) such that:
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289}.
\]
We can check the values of \( n \) modulo 17:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&0^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{17}, \\
&1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17}, \\
&2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{17}.
\end{aligned}
\]
So, \( n = 2 \) is a solution, and \( 2^4 + 1 = 17 \) is divisible by \( 17 \). We need to check if \( 2^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \):
\[
2^4 + 1 = 17 \quad \text{(not divisible by 289)}.
\]
However, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \). We can use the fact that \( n = 2 \) is a solution to the congruence \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \). The solutions to this congruence are \( n \equiv 2, 8, 9, 15 \pmod{17} \). We need to check these values modulo 289:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&2^4 + 1 = 17, \\
&8^4 + 1 = 4097 \equiv 17 \pmod{289}, \\
&9^4 + 1 = 6562 \equiv 17 \pmod{289}, \\
&15^4 + 1 = 50626 \equiv 17 \pmod{289}.
\end{aligned}
\]
None of these values are divisible by 289, so we need to find another approach. We can use the fact that \( n = 2 \) is a solution to the congruence \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \). The solutions to this congruence are \( n \equiv 2, 8, 9, 15 \pmod{17} \). We need to check these values modulo 289:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&2^4 + 1 = 17, \\
&8^4 + 1 = 4097 \equiv 17 \pmod{289}, \\
&9^4 + 1 = 6562 \equiv 17 \pmod{289}, \\
&15^4 + 1 = 50626 \equiv 17 \pmod{289}.
\end{aligned}
\]
None of these values are divisible by 289, so we need to find another approach. The correct approach is to use the fact that \( n = 2 \) is a solution to the congruence \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \). The solutions to this congruence are \( n \equiv 2, 8, 9, 15 \pmod{17} \). The smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \( m = 2 \).

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",110,"[110, '110']",False

"To solve the given problem, we start with the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). We will convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). By the definition of logarithms, this means:
\[
x^{10} = y^x.
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Similarly, this means:
\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(x^{10} = y^x\),
2. \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\).

To eliminate the exponents, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:
\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}.
\]

Next, for the second equation:
\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}.
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}.
\]

To solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25.

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( n \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, given that Alice starts and each player can remove either 1 or 4 shenies from the pile of \( n \) shenies. The player who removes the last shenies wins.

First, let's analyze the game by considering the possible outcomes based on the number of shenies left. We will use dynamic programming to identify the winning and losing positions.

### Step 1: Identify the Base Cases
- If \( n = 0 \), the player to move loses because there are no shenies left to remove. So, \( n = 0 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 1 \), the player to move wins by removing the last sheney. So, \( n = 1 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 2 \), the player to move wins by removing 1 sheney, leaving 1 sheney for the opponent. So, \( n = 2 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 3 \), the player to move wins by removing 1 sheney, leaving 2 shenies for the opponent. So, \( n = 3 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 4 \), the player to move wins by removing all 4 shenies. So, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 5 \), the player to move loses because no matter whether they remove 1 or 4 shenies, they will leave a winning position for the opponent. So, \( n = 5 \) is a losing position.

### Step 2: Generalize the Pattern
From the base cases, we can see that the losing positions are \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 5 \). Let's check the next few values to see if we can identify a pattern:
- If \( n = 6 \), the player to move wins by removing 1 sheney, leaving 5 shenies for the opponent. So, \( n = 6 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 7 \), the player to move wins by removing 1 sheney, leaving 6 shenies for the opponent. So, \( n = 7 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 8 \), the player to move wins by removing 1 sheney, leaving 7 shenies for the opponent. So, \( n = 8 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 9 \), the player to move wins by removing 1 sheney, leaving 8 shenies for the opponent. So, \( n = 9 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 10 \), the player to move wins by removing 4 shenies, leaving 6 shenies for the opponent. So, \( n = 10 \) is a winning position.

From this, we can see that the losing positions are \( n = 5k \) for non-negative integers \( k \). This is because if \( n = 5k \), no matter whether the player to move removes 1 or 4 shenies, they will leave a winning position for the opponent.

### Step 3: Find the Values of \( n \) Less Than or Equal to 2024
We need to find the number of integers \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \) is not a multiple of 5. The number of multiples of 5 in this range is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404
\]
Therefore, the number of integers \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \) is not a multiple of 5 is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the maximum prize given that she wins at least some prize. This involves determining the number of favorable outcomes for each condition and then using conditional probability.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, we need to find the number of ways Jen can win at least some prize. Jen wins at least some prize if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers drawn. We will use the complement principle to find this. The complement is the number of ways Jen does not win any prize, which is the number of ways she chooses 4 numbers such that none of them are among the 4 numbers drawn.

If Jen does not win any prize, she must choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since 4 numbers are drawn and 6 are not). The number of ways to do this is:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of ways Jen wins at least some prize is:
\[
\binom{10}{4} - \binom{6}{4} = 210 - 15 = 195
\]

Now, we need to find the number of ways Jen wins the maximum prize, which is the number of ways she chooses all 4 numbers correctly. There is only 1 way for this to happen:
\[

\[
\frac{\binom{4}{4}}{\binom{10}{4} - \binom{6}{4}} = \frac{1}{195}

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{1}{195}\). Since \(m = 1\) and \(n = 195\) are relatively prime, we have:

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties involved.

1. **Identify the Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
   The quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic because all its vertices lie on the same circle. This implies that the opposite angles of \(ADHG\) sum to \(180^\circ\).

2. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, we can use the Power of a Point theorem at point \(E\) with respect to the circle on which \(A, D, H, G\) lie. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \(E\) outside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one secant line through \(E\) are equal to the products of the lengths of the segments of another secant line through \(E\). Here, the secant lines are \(EBC\) and \(EFG\).

   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   EB \cdot EC = EF \cdot EG
   \]

3. **Express \(EB\) and \(EG\) in terms of known lengths:**
   We know that \(EB = AB - AE\) and \(EG = EF + FG\). However, we don't have the lengths of \(AE\) and \(EG\) directly, but we can use the fact that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and the cyclic property to find a relationship between \(EB\) and \(EG\).

4. **Use the Similarity of Triangles:**
   Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, the triangles \(ABE\) and \(FCE\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion (because \(\angle ABE = \angle FCE\) and \(\angle AEB = \angle FEC\)). Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
   \[
   \frac{AB}{FC} = \frac{EB}{EC}
   \]
   Similarly, the triangles \(ADG\) and \(HCF\) are also similar, so:
   \[
   \frac{AD}{HC} = \frac{AG}{CF}
   \]

5. **Use the given lengths to find \(CE\):**
   We know \(AB = 107\), \(BC = 16\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\). Since \(E\) is a point on the line \(BC\) and \(F\) is a point on the line \(FG\), we can use the Power of a Point theorem directly:
   \[
   EB \cdot EC = EF \cdot EG
   \]
   Let \(EB = x\) and \(EC = y\). Then \(x + y = BC = 16\). Also, \(EG = EF + FG = 184 + 17 = 201\). Therefore:
   \[
   x \cdot y = 184 \cdot 201
   \]
   We need to solve the system of equations:
   \[
   x + y = 16
   \]
   \[
   x \cdot y = 184 \cdot 201
   \]
   The quadratic equation whose roots are \(x\) and \(y\) is:
   \[
   t^2 - 16t + 184 \cdot 201 = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of paths of length 16 that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, and that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), and the direction change occurs when a right move is followed by an up move or vice versa.

A path that changes direction exactly four times will have exactly five segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, a path might look like RRRRUUUU RRRRUUUU or UUUURRRR UUUURRRR, etc. The number of such paths is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange 5 segments of R's and U's such that there are exactly 8 R's and 8 U's in total.

This is a combinatorial problem where we need to choose 4 positions out of 15 (since there are 15 direction changes possible in a path of 16 moves) to place the direction changes. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

However, we need to consider that each segment of R's and U's must be non-empty. This is a more complex problem, but it can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or by using a recursive approach. For simplicity, we will use the known result for this type of problem, which is given by the formula for the number of lattice paths with exactly \(k\) direction changes.

The number of paths of length \(2n\) from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that change direction exactly \(k\) times is given by:
\[
\binom{2n}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i \binom{k}{i} \binom{2n-2i}{n-i}
\]

For \(n=8\) and \(k=4\), this formula becomes:
\[
\binom{16}{8} \sum_{i=0}^{4} (-1)^i \binom{4}{i} \binom{16-2i}{8-i}
\]

Calculating this, we get:
\[
\binom{16}{8} = 12870
\]
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{4} (-1)^i \binom{4}{i} \binom{16-2i}{8-i} = \binom{16}{8} - 4 \binom{14}{7} + 6 \binom{12}{6} - 4 \binom{10}{5} + \binom{8}{4}
\]
\[
= 12870 - 4 \cdot 3432 + 6 \cdot 924 - 4 \cdot 252 + 70
\]
\[
= 12870 - 13728 + 5544 - 1008 + 70

Therefore, the number of paths of length 16 that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid, and that change direction exactly four times, is:

"To find the largest real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta.
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (336\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i.
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize the real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\) and \(\phi\) is an angle such that \(\cos\phi = \frac{324}{R}\) and \(\sin\phi = \frac{432}{R}\).

First, we calculate \(R\):
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) can be written as:
\[
540\cos(\theta + \phi).

The maximum value of \(\cos(\theta + \phi)\) is 1, so the maximum value of the real part is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the triangle \(ABC\) given the information about the circles tangent to its sides. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties involved.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are 8 circles with radius 34 that are tangent to each other in a sequence and also tangent to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\).
   - There are 2024 circles with radius 1 that are tangent to each other in a similar manner and also tangent to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\).
   - We need to find the area of triangle \(ABC\) and express it as \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, and then find \(m+n\).

2. **Geometric Analysis:**
   - The centers of the 8 circles with radius 34 form a regular octagon. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is \(2 \times 34 = 68\).
   - The distance from the center of each circle to the side \(AB\) or \(BC\) is 34.
   - Similarly, the centers of the 2024 circles with radius 1 form a regular octagon with a side length of \(2 \times 1 = 2\).
   - The distance from the center of each circle to the side \(AB\) or \(BC\) is 1.

3. **Finding the Side Length of the Triangle:**
   - The side length of the triangle \(ABC\) is the sum of the distances from the centers of the circles to the sides plus the distance between the centers of the outermost circles.
   - For the 8 circles, the side length of the triangle is \(2 \times 34 + 68 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 68 + 68 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 68 \left(2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 68 \left(2 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 68 \left(\frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 34 \left(4 + \sqrt{2}\right)\).
   - For the 2024 circles, the side length of the triangle is \(2 \times 1 + 2 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 2 + 2 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 2 \left(2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 2 \left(2 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 2 \left(\frac{4 + \sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 4 + \sqrt{2}\).

4. **Finding the Area of the Triangle:**
   - The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\).
   - For the side length \(34 \left(4 + \sqrt{2}\right)\), the area is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left(34 \left(4 + \sqrt{2}\right)\right)^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 34^2 \times \left(4 + \sqrt{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 1156 \times \left(16 + 8\sqrt{2} + 2\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 1156 \times \left(18 + 8\sqrt{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 1156 \times 2 \left(9 + 4\sqrt{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 1156 \times \left(9 + 4\sqrt{2}\right) = 578 \sqrt{3} \left(9 + 4\sqrt{2}\right) = 5102 \sqrt{3} + 2312 \sqrt{6}\).

5. **Simplifying the Area:**
   - The area of the triangle is \(\frac{5102 \sqrt{3} + 2312 \sqrt{6}}{1}\).
   - Since the problem asks for the area in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers, we need to find the sum \(m + n\).

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is \(\frac{5102 \sqrt{3} + 2312 \sqrt{6}}{1}\), so \(m = 5102 \sqrt{3} + 2312 \sqrt{6}\) and \(n = 1\).
   - Therefore, \(m + n = 5102 + 2312 = 7414\).

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the hyperbola given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). The diagonals of the rhombus \(ABCD\) intersect at the origin, so we can assume that the vertices of the rhombus are symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and the y-axis. Let the coordinates of the vertices be \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(B = (-x_1, -y_1)\), \(C = (-x_1, y_1)\), and \(D = (x_1, -y_1)\).

Since \(A\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1\). The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2y_1\) and the length of the diagonal \(AC\) is \(2x_1\). The area of the rhombus can be expressed as \(\frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x_1 \times 2y_1 = 2x_1 y_1\).

We need to find the minimum value of \(BD^2 = (2y_1)^2 = 4y_1^2\) under the constraint \(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1\). From the hyperbola equation, we can express \(x_1^2\) in terms of \(y_1^2\):
\[
x_1^2 = 20 \left(1 + \frac{y_1^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{5y_1^2}{6}.
\]
To minimize \(4y_1^2\), we need to find the value of \(y_1^2\) that satisfies the hyperbola equation. Since \(x_1^2\) must be positive, \(y_1^2\) can take any non-negative value. However, we are asked to find the minimum value of \(BD^2\) for the rhombus, which is simply \(4y_1^2\).

From the hyperbola equation, we see that as \(y_1^2\) increases, \(x_1^2\) also increases, but the minimum value of \(y_1^2\) is 0, which is not possible since it would make \(x_1^2 = 20\), and the rhombus would degenerate into a line segment. Therefore, the minimum value of \(y_1^2\) is 24, which gives:
\[
4y_1^2 = 4 \times 24 = 96.

Thus, the minimum value of \(BD^2\) is \(\boxed{96}\).","[96, '96']",480,"[480, '480']",False
"To find the number of banors in Aimeville that zotërojnë exactly four of the four given things, we will use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the set of banors that zotërojnë një unazë diamanti.
- Let \( B \) be the set of banors that zotërojnë një set shkopinj golfi.
- Let \( C \) be the set of banors that zotërojnë një lopatë kopshti.
- Let \( D \) be the set of banors that zotërojnë një qese me zemra karamele.

We are given the following information:
- \( |A| = 195 \)
- \( |B| = 367 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- \( |D| = 900 \) (since every banor zotëron qese me zemra karamele)
- \( |A \cup B| = 437 \)
- \( |A \cup C| = 437 \)
- \( |A \cup D| = 437 \)
- \( |B \cup C| = 437 \)
- \( |B \cup D| = 437 \)
- \( |C \cup D| = 437 \)
- \( |A \cup B \cup C| = 234 \)
- \( |A \cup B \cup D| = 234 \)
- \( |A \cup C \cup D| = 234 \)
- \( |B \cup C \cup D| = 234 \)

We need to find the number of banors that zotërojnë exactly four of these things, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

First, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for three sets to find the number of banors that zotërojnë exactly three of the things. For example, for \( |A \cap B \cap C| \):
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|

\[
234 = 195 + 367 + 562 - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|

\[
234 = 1124 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |B \cap C|) + |A \cap B \cap C|

|A \cap B \cap D| = 890
\]
\[
|A \cap C \cap D| = 890
\]
\[
|B \cap C \cap D| = 890

Now, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for four sets to find the number of banors that zotërojnë exactly four of the things:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|

Since every banor zotëron qese me zemra karamele, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \):

\[
900 = 5484 - (|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D|) - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D|
\]
\[
|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| + |B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| = 4584

We know that:

|A \cap B| + |A \cap C| + |A \cap D| = 890

\[
|B \cap C| + |B \cap D| + |C \cap D| = 890

"To find the number of triples \((a, b, c)\) of non-negative integers that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to this system. Let's assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we have \(c = 300 - a - b\). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:
\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]
To find possible values for \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the quadratic formula. However, a more practical approach is to test some values for \(a\) and solve for \(b\).

Let's start with \(a = 100\):
\[
100^2 + b^2 + 100b - 300 \cdot 100 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
10,000 + b^2 + 100b - 30,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 200) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 0 = 200\). If \(b = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 200 = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\).

Next, let's test \(a = 200\):
\[
200^2 + b^2 + 200b - 300 \cdot 200 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
40,000 + b^2 + 200b - 60,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 100b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 100) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 0 = 100\). If \(b = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 100 = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\) and \((200, 100, 0)\).

Finally, let's test \(a = 0\):
\[
0^2 + b^2 + 0 \cdot b - 300 \cdot 0 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20,000}}{2 \cdot 1}\), we get:
\[
b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2},
\]
\[
b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2},
\]
\[
b = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]
So, \(b = 200\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 0 - 200 = 100\). If \(b = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 0 - 100 = 200\). Therefore, the solutions are \((0, 200, 100)\) and \((0, 100, 200)\).

Combining all the solutions, we have:
\[
(100, 0, 200), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (200, 100, 0), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the unique point \(C\) on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\) such that it does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) with length 1, where \(P\) is on the x-axis and \(Q\) is on the y-axis.

First, let's find the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The slope of the line \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}

Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we get:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

So, the equation of the line \(\overline{AB}\) is:

A point \((x, y)\) on the line \(\overline{AB}\) can be written as \((x, -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\). For this point to not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) with length 1, the distance from \(C\) to the x-axis and the y-axis must be such that the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by these distances is not 1.

The distance from \(C\) to the x-axis is \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and the distance from \(C\) to the y-axis is \(x\). The hypotenuse of the right triangle is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}}

We need this hypotenuse to be equal to 1:
\[
\sqrt{4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}} = 1 \implies 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 1 \implies 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 4 \implies 16x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 16\), \(b = -12\), and \(c = -1\):
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 64}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{208}}{32} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{13}}{32} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
Since \(C\) is on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), \(x\) must be between 0 and \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, we take the smaller root:
\[
x = \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}
\]
The corresponding \(y\)-coordinate is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{-3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8}
\]
The coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)\). The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39}}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(3 - \sqrt{13})^2 + (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{39})^2}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{9 - 6\sqrt{13} + 13 + 3 + 2\sqrt{117} + 39}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{64}{64}} = 1
\]
However, we need to find the unique point \(C\) that does not lie on any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). This point is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\):
\[
C = \left(\frac{\frac{1}{2} + 0}{2}, \frac{0 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)
\]
The distance \(OC\) is:
\[
OC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{16}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, \(p = 1\) and \(q = 4\), and \(p + q = 5\).

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, i.e., \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{12} + \omega^{11} + \cdots + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). First, we note that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the product becomes \((2-2\cdot1+1^2)\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

Next, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\). Notice that \(P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1\). Therefore, \(P(\omega^k) = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\).

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). The polynomial \(P(x)\) evaluated at these roots can be related to the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) by considering the polynomial \(R(x) = P(x)P(x^2) \cdots P(x^{12})\). The constant term of \(R(x)\) is \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\).

To find the constant term of \(R(x)\), we can use the fact that \(P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1\). Therefore, \(P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\). The polynomial \(R(x)\) is a polynomial of degree 24, and its constant term is the product of the constant terms of \(P(x)\) evaluated at the roots of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\), which is \(2^{12} = 4096\).

However, we need to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. We have \(4096 \mod 1000 = 96\).

Thus, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{96}\).","[96, '96']",321,"[321, '321']",False
"To find the smallest base \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the definition of a \( b \)-beautiful number. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it is a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write \( n = ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). According to the definition, we have:
\[
a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c

Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[
a^2 + (2c - b)a + c^2 - c = 0
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \( a \). For \( a \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant is:
\[
(2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c) = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2 - 4c^2 + 4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c

"To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed by selecting sides or diagonals of a regular dodecagon, we need to consider the different ways to choose four vertices of the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. A rectangle in a regular dodecagon can be formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12}\) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle is formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices. For example, if we choose vertices \(A_i\) and \(A_{i+6}\), then the other two vertices must be \(A_j\) and \(A_{j+6}\) where \(j \neq i\) and \(j \neq i+6\).

The number of ways to choose the first pair of opposite vertices is 6 (since there are 12 vertices, and each pair of opposite vertices is counted twice). After choosing the first pair, the number of ways to choose the second pair of opposite vertices is 5 (since we cannot choose the same pair again).

However, since the order in which we choose the pairs does not matter, we need to divide by 2. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is:
\[
\frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15
\]

Thus, the number of rectangles that can be formed is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",315,"[315, '315']",True

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) table with digits such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the digits from left to right in each row is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the digits from top to bottom in each column is 99.

Let's denote the table as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
where \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) are digits from 0 to 9.

### Step 1: Sum of the numbers in each row
The number formed by the digits in the first row is \(100a + 10b + c\), and the number formed by the digits in the second row is \(100d + 10e + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 999:
\[
(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
\]
From this equation, we can see that:
\[
a + d = 9, \quad b + e = 9, \quad c + f = 9
\]

### Step 2: Sum of the numbers in each column
The number formed by the digits in the first column is \(10a + d\), the number formed by the digits in the second column is \(10b + e\), and the number formed by the digits in the third column is \(10c + f\). According to the problem, their sum is 99:
\[
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
\]
From this equation, we can see that:
\[
a + b + c = 9, \quad d + e + f = 9
\]

### Step 3: Solving the system of equations
We have the following system of equations:
1. \(a + d = 9\)
2. \(b + e = 9\)
3. \(c + f = 9\)
4. \(a + b + c = 9\)
5. \(d + e + f = 9\)

From equations 1, 2, and 3, we can express \(d, e,\) and \(f\) in terms of \(a, b,\) and \(c\):
\[
d = 9 - a, \quad e = 9 - b, \quad f = 9 - c
\]
Substituting these into equations 4 and 5, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 9
\]
\[
(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 9 \implies 27 - (a + b + c) = 9 \implies 27 - 9 = 9 \implies 18 = 9
\]
The second equation is always true given the first equation. Therefore, the only constraint is \(a + b + c = 9\).

### Step 4: Counting the number of solutions
We need to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(a + b + c = 9\). This is a classic ""stars and bars"" problem, and the number of solutions is given by:
\[
\binom{9 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{11}{2} = \frac{11 \times 10}{2 \times 1} = 55

"To solve the given system of equations, we start with the equations:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations together, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the problem. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, and the sum of the coefficients in the system of equations is 3. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, and the sum of the coefficients in the system of equations is 3.

Thus, we have:

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4 \left(-\frac{13}{12}\right) = -\frac{52}{12} = -\frac{13}{3}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is:

\[
\left|-\frac{13}{3}\right| = \frac{13}{3}
\]

The values of \(m\) and \(n\) are 13 and 3, respectively. Thus, \(m + n = 13 + 3 = 16\).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometric configuration of the torus \( T \) and the sphere \( S \). The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around a line in its plane that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

When the torus \( T \) is in the outer region of the sphere \( S \) and is tangent to \( S \) along a circle, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle of tangency is the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the circle of tangency. This distance is also the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the radius of the torus.

The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is the distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of rotation of the torus plus the radius of the circle that is rotated to form the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the axis of rotation of the torus is 6 units, and the radius of the circle is 3 units. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units.

When the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, the radius of the circle of tangency \( r_i \) is given by:
\[ r_i = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

When the torus is in the inner region of the sphere and is tangent to \( S \) along a circle, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle of tangency is the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the circle of tangency. This distance is also the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the radius of the torus.

The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is still 9 units. Therefore, the radius of the circle of tangency \( r_o \) is given by:
\[ 9 - r_o = 11 \]
\[ r_o = 9 - 11 = -2 \]

The difference between the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 2 - (-2) = 4 \]

Thus, the difference \( r_i - r_o \) can be written as \( \frac{4}{1} \), where \( m = 4 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 50 chess pieces (25 black and 25 white) on a \(5 \times 5\) chessboard such that each row and each column contains at most one piece, and all pieces in the same row or column have the same color. Additionally, each piece placed on the board must satisfy the condition that it either meets the row condition or the column condition, but not necessarily both.

First, let's consider the placement of the pieces. Since each row and each column can contain at most one piece, the pieces form a permutation of the rows and columns. This means we can represent the placement of pieces as a permutation of the numbers from 1 to 5, where the \(i\)-th number in the permutation indicates the column in which the piece in the \(i\)-th row is placed.

For each permutation, we need to decide the color of each piece. There are two choices for the color of the piece in each row: black or white. However, since all pieces in the same row must have the same color, we only need to choose the color for each row independently. Therefore, there are \(2^5 = 32\) ways to assign colors to the pieces for a given permutation.

The number of permutations of 5 elements is \(5!\). Therefore, the total number of ways to place the pieces is the product of the number of permutations and the number of color assignments for each permutation:
\[
5! \times 32 = 120 \times 32 = 3840
\]

Thus, the number of ways to place the pieces on the chessboard is \(\boxed{3840}\).","[3840, '3840']",902,"[902, '902']",False
