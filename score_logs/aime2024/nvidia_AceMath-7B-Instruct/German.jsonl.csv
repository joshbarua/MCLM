"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will be 0 at \( x = \frac{k}{2} \) for integers \( k \) and will be 1 at \( x = \frac{2k+1}{4} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will be 0 at \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and will be 1 at \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 4. It will be 0 at \( x = \frac{k}{2} \) for integers \( k \) and will be 4 at \( x = \frac{2k+1}{4} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will be 0 at \( y = \frac{2k}{3} \) for integers \( k \) and will be 1 at \( y = \frac{2k+1}{6} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 7: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 4. It will be 0 at \( y = \frac{2k}{3} \) for integers \( k \) and will be 4 at \( y = \frac{2k+1}{6} \) for integers \( k \).

### Step 8: Find the intersection points
The graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will intersect at points where \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are equal. Since both functions are periodic and symmetric, we need to count the number of intersection points in one period and then extend to the entire domain.

By analyzing the periodicity and symmetry, we find that there are 12 intersection points in one period of \( x \) and \( y \). Therefore, the total number of intersection points is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]","[12, '12']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide one of the factors \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) in some extension field of the integers modulo \( p \). This implies that \( -1 \) must be a fourth power residue modulo \( p \).

We need to find the smallest prime \( p \) for which \( -1 \) is a fourth power residue modulo \( p \). This is equivalent to finding the smallest prime \( p \) such that the order of \( -1 \) modulo \( p \) is a divisor of \( 4 \). The order of \( -1 \) modulo \( p \) is \( 2 \) if \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) and \( 1 \) if \( p = 2 \). Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) for which \( -1 \) is a fourth power residue modulo \( p \) is \( 17 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \). We know that \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \). We can check the values of \( m \) modulo \( 17 \) to find the smallest \( m \) that satisfies this condition.

By trial, we find:
\[
1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{17}, \quad 2^4 \equiv 16 \pmod{17}, \quad 3^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 13 \pmod{17}, \quad 4^4 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{17},
\]
\[
5^4 \equiv 625 \equiv 13 \pmod{17}, \quad 6^4 \equiv 1296 \equiv 16 \pmod{17}, \quad 7^4 \equiv 2401 \equiv 1 \pmod{17},
\]
\[
8^4 \equiv 4096 \equiv 16 \pmod{17}, \quad 9^4 \equiv 6561 \equiv 13 \pmod{17}, \quad 10^4 \equiv 10000 \equiv 1 \pmod{17},
\]
\[
11^4 \equiv 14641 \equiv 16 \pmod{17}, \quad 12^4 \equiv 20736 \equiv 13 \pmod{17}, \quad 13^4 \equiv 28561 \equiv 1 \pmod{17},
\]
\[
14^4 \equiv 38416 \equiv 16 \pmod{17}, \quad 15^4 \equiv 50625 \equiv 13 \pmod{17}, \quad 16^4 \equiv 65536 \equiv 1 \pmod{17}.
\]
We see that \( m \equiv 2, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 \pmod{17} \) satisfy \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \). The smallest positive \( m \) is \( 2 \).

To check if \( 2^4 + 1 = 17 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \), we need to check if \( 2^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17 \). Since \( 2^4 + 1 = 17 \), it is divisible by \( 17 \) but not by \( 17^2 \). Therefore, we need to find the next \( m \) that satisfies \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \) and check if \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \).

The next \( m \) is \( 6 \). We check:
\[
6^4 + 1 = 1296 + 1 = 1297.
\]
We need to check if \( 1297 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We find:
\[
1297 \div 289 \approx 4.4844.
\]
Since \( 1297 \) is not divisible by \( 289 \), we need to find the next \( m \).

The next \( m \) is \( 7 \). We check:
\[
7^4 + 1 = 2401 + 1 = 2402.
\]
We need to check if \( 2402 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We find:
\[
2402 \div 289 \approx 8.3065.
\]
Since \( 2402 \) is not divisible by \( 289 \), we need to find the next \( m \).

The next \( m \) is \( 11 \). We check:
\[
11^4 + 1 = 14641 + 1 = 14642.
\]
We need to check if \( 14642 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We find:
\[
14642 \div 289 = 50.6644.
\]
Since \( 14642 \) is not divisible by \( 289 \), we need to find the next \( m \).

The next \( m \) is \( 13 \). We check:
\[
13^4 + 1 = 28561 + 1 = 28562.
\]
We need to check if \( 28562 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We find:
\[
28562 \div 289 = 98.854.
\]
Since \( 28562 \) is not divisible by \( 289 \), we need to find the next \( m \).

The next \( m \) is \( 14 \). We check:
\[
14^4 + 1 = 38416 + 1 = 38417.
\]
We need to check if \( 38417 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We find:
\[
38417 \div 289 = 133.
\]
Since \( 38417 \) is divisible by \( 289 \), the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \( 14 \).

"To solve the given problem, we start with the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). We will convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). By the definition of logarithms, this means:
\[
x^{10} = y^x.
\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Similarly, this means:
\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(x^{10} = y^x\),
2. \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\).

To eliminate the exponents, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:
\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}.
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:
\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}.
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}.
\]

To solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25.
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if any move from that position leads to a winning position, and a winning position is one from which there is at least one move to a losing position.

Let's start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If \( n = 1 \), Alice wins by taking the last stone.
- If \( n = 2 \), Alice wins by taking 1 stone, leaving Bob with 1 stone.
- If \( n = 3 \), Alice wins by taking 1 stone, leaving Bob with 2 stones.
- If \( n = 4 \), Alice wins by taking all 4 stones.
- If \( n = 5 \), Alice wins by taking 1 stone, leaving Bob with 4 stones.
- If \( n = 6 \), Alice wins by taking 1 stone, leaving Bob with 5 stones.
- If \( n = 7 \), Alice wins by taking 1 stone, leaving Bob with 6 stones.
- If \( n = 8 \), Alice wins by taking 4 stones, leaving Bob with 4 stones.

From the above, we see that \( n = 8 \) is a losing position because any move Alice makes will leave Bob with a winning position. Let's check the next few positions:
- If \( n = 9 \), Alice wins by taking 1 stone, leaving Bob with 8 stones.
- If \( n = 10 \), Alice wins by taking 1 stone, leaving Bob with 9 stones.
- If \( n = 11 \), Alice wins by taking 1 stone, leaving Bob with 10 stones.
- If \( n = 12 \), Alice wins by taking 4 stones, leaving Bob with 8 stones.

We observe that \( n = 8 \) is a losing position and \( n = 12 \) is also a losing position because any move Alice makes will leave Bob with a winning position. This suggests a pattern where the losing positions are of the form \( 8k \) for non-negative integers \( k \).

To confirm this pattern, we need to show that if \( n = 8k \), then any move Alice makes will leave Bob with a winning position. If Alice takes 1 stone, the position becomes \( 8k - 1 \), which is a winning position. If Alice takes 4 stones, the position becomes \( 8k - 4 \), which is also a winning position. Therefore, \( n = 8k \) is indeed a losing position.

Now, we need to count the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \) is a multiple of 8. The largest multiple of 8 that is less than or equal to 2024 is \( 2024 \) itself. The sequence of multiples of 8 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a = 8 \) and the common difference \( d = 8 \). The \( k \)-th term of this sequence is given by:
\[ a_k = 8k \]
We need to find the largest \( k \) such that \( 8k \leq 2024 \):
\[ k \leq \frac{2024}{8} = 253 \]
Thus, there are 253 positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \) is a multiple of 8.

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and Bob has a winning strategy is:

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U), and the direction change occurs when a right move is followed by an up move or vice versa.

A path that changes direction exactly four times must have exactly four ""R"" followed by ""U"" and four ""U"" followed by ""R"". This means that the sequence of moves can be thought of as a sequence of 5 blocks of ""R"" and ""U"" where each block is either ""R"" or ""U"" and the blocks alternate in length. For example, a valid sequence could be ""RRRUUUURRRUUUURRRU"" or ""UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"".

The problem then reduces to finding the number of ways to arrange 8 ""R"" and 8 ""U"" such that there are exactly four ""R"" followed by ""U"" and four ""U"" followed by ""R"". This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 5 blocks of ""R"" and ""U"" where each block is either ""R"" or ""U"" and the blocks alternate in length.

The number of such sequences is given by the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 7 for the ""R"" followed by ""U"" (or equivalently, the ""U"" followed by ""R""), which is \(\binom{7}{4}\).

However, we need to consider that the first move can be either ""R"" or ""U"", and the rest of the sequence will be determined by the number of direction changes. Therefore, the total number of paths is \(2 \times \binom{7}{4}\).

Calculating \(\binom{7}{4}\), we get:
\[
\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = 35
\]

Thus, the total number of paths is:
\[
2 \times 35 = 70

Therefore, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{70}\).","[70, '70']",294,"[294, '294']",False
"To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta.

Since \(i^2 = -1\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (348\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta)i.
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize the real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\).

Calculating \(R\), we get:
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

Thus, the maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) is \(R = 540\).

"To find the number of triples of non-negative integers \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the conditions \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to this system. Consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a, b, c\):
\[
P(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = x^3 - (a+b+c)x^2 + (ab+bc+ca)x - abc.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
P(x) = x^3 - 300x^2 + 20,000x - abc.
\]
To find the possible values of \(a, b, c\), we can use the fact that \(a, b, c\) must be integers that satisfy both equations. Let's test some possible values for \(a, b, c\).

First, assume \(a = 100\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 200,
\]
\[
100b + 100c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 200 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
100b + 100(200 - b) + b(200 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 200b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
200b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(200 - b) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 200\), and if \(b = 200\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\).

Next, assume \(a = 200\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 100,
\]
\[
200b + 200c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 100 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
200b + 200(100 - b) + b(100 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 100b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
100b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(100 - b) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 100\), and if \(b = 100\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\).

Finally, assume \(a = 0\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 300,
\]
\[
bc = 20,000.
\]
The solutions to this quadratic equation are:
\[
b, c = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 20,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]
So, \(b = 200\) and \(c = 100\), or \(b = 100\) and \(c = 200\). Therefore, the solutions are \((0, 200, 100)\), \((0, 100, 200)\), and \((200, 0, 100)\), which are already counted.

Thus, the distinct solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), \((0, 100, 200)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\). There are 6 such solutions.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle in this context is defined by choosing two pairs of opposite sides, where each pair is formed by vertices that are either adjacent or connected by a diagonal.

### Step 1: Identify the possible pairs of vertices
For a rectangle, we need to choose two pairs of vertices such that the vertices in each pair are either adjacent or connected by a diagonal. This means we need to choose two pairs of vertices that are not directly opposite each other but are symmetric with respect to the center of the dodecagon.

### Step 2: Count the number of valid pairs
Consider a vertex \( A_i \). The possible vertices that can form a rectangle with \( A_i \) are \( A_{i+2}, A_{i+4}, A_{i+6}, A_{i+8}, A_{i+10} \) ( indices taken modulo 12). This is because these vertices are either adjacent or connected by a diagonal and are not directly opposite \( A_i \).

For each vertex \( A_i \), there are 5 possible vertices that can form a rectangle with it. Since there are 12 vertices in the dodecagon, and each rectangle is counted twice (once for each pair of opposite sides), the total number of rectangles is:
\[
\frac{12 \times 5}{2} = 30
\]

Thus, the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon is \(\boxed{30}\).","[30, '30']",315,"[315, '315']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) and the sets \( B \) that Bob lists. Bob lists all finite non-empty subsets \( B \) of positive integers such that the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). Let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \).

For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the subsets \( B \) that Bob lists are all subsets of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i\} \) that include \( a_i \). The number of such subsets is the number of subsets of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, a_i-1\} \), which is \( 2^{a_i-1} \).

Since Bob's list contains 2024 subsets, we have:
\[
2^{a_1-1} + 2^{a_2-1} + \cdots + 2^{a_n-1} = 2024
\]

To find the sum of the elements of \( A \), we need to determine the values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). First, we express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2:
\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2
\]

This means:
\[
2^{a_1-1} = 2^2, \quad 2^{a_2-1} = 2^3, \quad 2^{a_3-1} = 2^4, \quad 2^{a_4-1} = 2^5, \quad 2^{a_5-1} = 2^6, \quad 2^{a_6-1} = 2^7, \quad 2^{a_7-1} = 2^8, \quad 2^{a_8-1} = 2^9, \quad 2^{a_9-1} = 2^{10}
\]

From these equations, we get:
\[
a_1 = 3, \quad a_2 = 4, \quad a_3 = 5, \quad a_4 = 6, \quad a_5 = 7, \quad a_6 = 8, \quad a_7 = 9, \quad a_8 = 10, \quad a_9 = 11
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 63

Thus, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

"To find the largest four-digit positive integer \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we start by expressing \( N \) in the form \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are digits and \( a \neq 0 \).

We need to check the divisibility of the numbers obtained by changing each digit to 1:
1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)
2. \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)

Since each of these numbers must be divisible by 7, we can use modular arithmetic to find the conditions on \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).

First, we note that \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), and \( 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \). Therefore, the conditions become:
1. \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

We can simplify these congruences:
1. \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

From the fourth congruence, we get:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

We can now use these congruences to find the values of \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). We start by testing the largest possible value for \( a \), which is 9. Substituting \( a = 9 \) into the second and third congruences, we get:
\[ 6(9) + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \implies 54 + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \implies 5 + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \implies 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6(9) + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \implies 54 + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \implies 5 + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \implies 2b + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

We also have:
\[ 6(9) + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 54 + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 5 + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \implies 2b + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

We now have the system of congruences:
1. \( 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 2b + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 2b + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

From the first congruence, we get \( d \equiv -3c \pmod{7} \). Substituting \( d \) into the second congruence, we get:
\[ 2b - 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

We now have the system:
1. \( 2b - 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 2b + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

Adding these two congruences, we get:
\[ 4b \equiv 7 \pmod{7} \implies 4b \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies b \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies b = 7 \]

Substituting \( b = 7 \) into the second congruence, we get:
\[ 2(7) + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \implies 14 + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \implies 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

The multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7 is 5, so:
\[ c \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \implies c = 5 \]

Substituting \( c = 5 \) into the first congruence, we get:
\[ d \equiv -3(5) \pmod{7} \implies d \equiv -15 \pmod{7} \implies d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \implies d = 6 \]

Therefore, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is \( 9756 \). To find \( Q \) and \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000, we have:
\[ Q = \left\lfloor \frac{9756}{1000} \right\rfloor = 9 \]
\[ R = 9756 - 9 \cdot 1000 = 756 \]

Finally, \( Q + R = 9 + 756 = 765 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) at which the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \) when \( T \) is on the outside of \( S \) in two different configurations. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Step 1: Determine the inner radius \( r_i \)
When the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \) along a circle with radius \( r_i \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is the sum of the radius of the sphere and the inner radius of the torus. The inner radius of the torus is the distance from the center of the circle on the torus to the inner surface of the torus, which is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units.

Thus, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is \( 11 + 3 = 14 \) units. This distance is also equal to the radius of the circle on the torus, which is \( r_i \). Therefore, we have:
\[ r_i = 14 \]

### Step 2: Determine the outer radius \( r_o \)
When the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \) along a circle with radius \( r_o \), the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is the difference between the radius of the sphere and the outer radius of the torus. The outer radius of the torus is the distance from the center of the circle on the torus to the outer surface of the torus, which is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units.

Thus, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) units. This distance is also equal to the radius of the circle on the torus, which is \( r_o \). Therefore, we have:
\[ r_o = 2 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the inner radius and the outer radius is:
\[ r_i - r_o = 14 - 2 = 12 \]

Since 12 is already in its simplest form, we have \( m = 12 \) and \( n = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 12 + 1 = 13 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some chips in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color, and any additional chip would violate one of these conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations of the chips. Since all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must have the same color, the chips must form a pattern where each row and each column contains chips of the same color. This means that the chips must form a collection of complete subgrids where each subgrid is filled with chips of the same color.

The possible subgrids are:
- A single cell (1 row and 1 column)
- A single row (1 row and multiple columns)
- A single column (multiple rows and 1 column)
- A subgrid of size \(2 \times 2\)
- A subgrid of size \(3 \times 3\)
- A subgrid of size \(4 \times 4\)
- A subgrid of size \(5 \times 5\)

However, since we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, the only possible subgrids are the \(5 \times 5\) grid itself, the \(5 \times 1\) and \(1 \times 5\) subgrids, and the \(2 \times 2\), \(3 \times 3\), and \(4 \times 4\) subgrids.

Let's count the number of ways to place the chips for each case:
1. **The entire \(5 \times 5\) grid:**
   - There are 2 ways to color the entire grid (all white or all black).

2. **A single row or a single column:**
   - There are 5 rows and 5 columns, and each row or column can be either white or black.
   - Therefore, there are \(10\) ways to place the chips in a single row or a single column.

3. **A \(2 \times 2\) subgrid:**
   - There are \(\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{5}{2} = 10 \times 10 = 100\) ways to choose the \(2 \times 2\) subgrid.
   - Each subgrid can be either white or black.
   - Therefore, there are \(200\) ways to place the chips in a \(2 \times 2\) subgrid.

4. **A \(3 \times 3\) subgrid:**
   - There are \(\binom{5}{3} \times \binom{5}{3} = 10 \times 10 = 100\) ways to choose the \(3 \times 3\) subgrid.
   - Each subgrid can be either white or black.
   - Therefore, there are \(200\) ways to place the chips in a \(3 \times 3\) subgrid.

5. **A \(4 \times 4\) subgrid:**
   - There are \(\binom{5}{4} \times \binom{5}{4} = 5 \times 5 = 25\) ways to choose the \(4 \times 4\) subgrid.
   - Each subgrid can be either white or black.
   - Therefore, there are \(50\) ways to place the chips in a \(4 \times 4\) subgrid.

Adding up all the possible ways, we get:
\[2 + 10 + 200 + 200 + 50 = 462\]

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{462}\).","[462, '462']",902,"[902, '902']",False
