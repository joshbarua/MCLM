"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time Aya spends walking each day and then add the time she spends in the café. Let's start by finding the walking speed \( s \) and the time \( t \) she spends in the café.

First, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the caminata is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in the café. The time she spends walking is \( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. Since the distance she walks is 9 kilometers, we can write:
\[
s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9
\]

Next, we know that when Aya walks at a speed of \( s+2 \) kilometers per hour, the total time for the caminata is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \( t \) minutes in the café. The time she spends walking is \( 2 + \frac{24}{60} - \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \) hours. So, we can write:
\[
(s+2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9
\]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( s \left( 4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9 \)
2. \( (s+2) \left( 2.4 - \frac{t}{60} \right) = 9 \)

Let's expand and simplify these equations. Starting with the first equation:
\[
4s - \frac{st}{60} = 9 \implies st = 240s - 540
\]

Next, expanding the second equation:
\[
2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60} = 9 \implies 2.4s + 4.8 - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60} = 9 \implies 2.4s - \frac{st}{60} - \frac{2t}{60} = 4.2
\]

Substituting \( st = 240s - 540 \) into the second equation:
\[
2.4s - \frac{240s - 540}{60} - \frac{2t}{60} = 4.2 \implies 2.4s - 4s + 9 - \frac{2t}{60} = 4.2 \implies -1.6s + 9 - \frac{2t}{60} = 4.2 \implies -1.6s + 4.8 = \frac{2t}{60} \implies -96s + 288 = 2t \implies t = 144 - 48s
\]

Substituting \( t = 144 - 48s \) back into the first equation:
\[
s \left( 4 - \frac{144 - 48s}{60} \right) = 9 \implies s \left( 4 - 2.4 + 0.8s \right) = 9 \implies s \left( 1.6 + 0.8s \right) = 9 \implies 1.6s + 0.8s^2 = 9 \implies 0.8s^2 + 1.6s - 9 = 0 \implies 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -45 \):
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 720}}{8} = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8} = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
\]
This gives us two solutions: \( s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \) and \( s = \frac{-36}{8} = -4.5 \). Since speed cannot be negative, we have \( s = 2.5 \) kilometers per hour.

Now, we find \( t \):
\[
t = 144 - 48 \cdot 2.5 = 144 - 120 = 24
\]

Finally, we need to find the time Aya spends walking if she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) kilometers per hour. The time she spends walking is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]
Adding the time she spends in the café:
\[
3 \text{ hours} + \frac{24}{60} \text{ hours} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours and } 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the number of minutes that Aya takes for the caminata, including the \( t \) minutes she spends in the café, is:

"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in the circle \(\omega\), we start by using the properties of the tangents and the power of a point theorem.

First, we note that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\). By the power of a point theorem, the power of point \(D\) with respect to \(\omega\) is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from \(D\) to \(\omega\), which is \(DB^2 = DC^2\). This power is also equal to \(DA \cdot DP\).

Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), \(D\) lies on the polar of \(A\) with respect to \(\omega\). Therefore, \(DA \cdot DP = DB^2 = DC^2\).

We can use the fact that \(D\) is the excenter of \(\triangle ABC\) opposite to \(A\). The length \(DB\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent from a vertex to the point of tangency of the excircle:
\[ DB = \frac{ac}{s-a} \]
where \(a = BC = 9\), \(b = AC = 10\), \(c = AB = 5\), and \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\):
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{9 + 10 + 5}{2} = 12. \]
Thus,
\[ DB = \frac{ac}{s-a} = \frac{5 \cdot 9}{12 - 9} = \frac{45}{3} = 15. \]
So, \(DB^2 = 15^2 = 225\).

Now, using the power of a point theorem, we have:
\[ DA \cdot DP = 225. \]

Next, we need to find \(DA\). The length \(DA\) can be found using the formula for the length of the cevian from a vertex to the point of intersection of the tangents at the other two vertices:
\[ DA = \frac{bc}{s} = \frac{10 \cdot 5}{12} = \frac{50}{12} = \frac{25}{6}. \]

Now, we can solve for \(DP\):
\[ DP = \frac{225}{DA} = \frac{225}{\frac{25}{6}} = 225 \cdot \frac{6}{25} = 54. \]

Therefore, the length \(AP\) is:
\[ AP = DA - DP = \frac{25}{6} - 54 = \frac{25}{6} - \frac{324}{6} = \frac{25 - 324}{6} = \frac{-299}{6}. \]

Since we are asked for the positive length \(AP\), we take the absolute value:
\[ AP = \frac{299}{6}. \]

The integers \(m\) and \(n\) are 299 and 6, respectively, and they are coprime. Thus, \(m + n = 299 + 6 = 305\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{305}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that an octagon with vertices colored either red or blue can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up in positions where there were originally red vertices. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Total Number of Colorings:**
   Each vertex of the octagon can be either red or blue, so there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

2. **Identifying Valid Colorings:**
   We need to count the number of colorings such that the octagon can be rotated to a position where all blue vertices are in positions originally occupied by red vertices. This means that the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the set of red vertices after some rotation.

3. **Symmetry and Orbits:**
   The octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8. Therefore, we need to consider the action of the cyclic group \(C_8\) on the set of colorings. Each coloring can be grouped into an orbit under this action. We need to count the number of colorings that are fixed by some rotation.

4. **Fixed Colorings:**
   A coloring is fixed by a rotation if the set of blue vertices is invariant under that rotation. This can only happen if the set of blue vertices is a union of complete sets of vertices that are equivalent under the rotation. For example, if the octagon is rotated by 45 degrees (i.e., by 1 vertex), the set of blue vertices must be either empty or the entire set of vertices. If the octagon is rotated by 90 degrees (i.e., by 2 vertices), the set of blue vertices must be a union of two sets of 4 vertices each, and so on.

5. **Counting Valid Colorings:**
   The only way for the set of blue vertices to be a subset of the set of red vertices after some rotation is if the set of blue vertices is empty. This is because if there is at least one blue vertex, it must be possible to rotate the octagon such that this blue vertex ends up in a position originally occupied by a red vertex, which means there must be a red vertex in the position originally occupied by the blue vertex. Therefore, the set of blue vertices must be empty.

6. **Conclusion:**
   There is only one coloring where all vertices are red, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, there is only 1 valid coloring out of the 256 possible colorings.

7. **Probability:**
   The probability is the number of valid colorings divided by the total number of colorings, which is \(\frac{1}{256}\).

8. **Final Answer:**
   The fraction \(\frac{1}{256}\) is already in its simplest form, so \(m = 1\) and \(n = 256\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 256 = 257\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{257}\).","[257, '257']",371,"[371, '371']",False
"To find the number of intersections of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is a piecewise function based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \left| x \right| \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) is a piecewise function based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - \left| x \right| \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Consequently, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
The function \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Consequently, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 5: Find the number of intersections
Since both \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are periodic and range from 0 to 1, we need to determine how many times their graphs intersect within the unit square \([0, 1] \times [0, 1]\).

The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) is symmetric about \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) and has a period of 1. Similarly, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) is symmetric about \( y = \frac{1}{2} \) and has a period of 1.

To find the number of intersections, we can consider the behavior of these functions over one period. The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) has 4 points where it reaches its maximum value of 1 and 4 points where it reaches its minimum value of 0 within the interval \([0, 1]\). Similarly, the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) has 6 points where it reaches its maximum value of 1 and 6 points where it reaches its minimum value of 0 within the interval \([0, 1]\).

Since the functions are continuous and piecewise linear, they will intersect at each point where their values are equal. Given the symmetry and periodicity, the number of intersections is the product of the number of points where each function reaches its maximum and minimum values, which is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

Therefore, the number of intersections of the graphs is \(\boxed{24}\).","[24, '24']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide one of the factors \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) with multiplicity at least 2. This implies that \( p \) must be a prime number such that \( -1 \) is a fourth power residue modulo \( p \).

We will check the smallest primes to find the smallest \( p \) that satisfies this condition.

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2},
   \]
   so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{3}.
   \]
   We check the values of \( n \) modulo 3:
   - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 3 \).

3. **For \( p = 5 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{5}.
   \]
   We check the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
   - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 5 \).

4. **For \( p = 17 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{17}.
   \]
   We check the values of \( n \) modulo 17:
   - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \).
   - If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \).
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17 \) when \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \). We need to check if \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \) for \( n = 2 \):

"To find the point \( I \) inside the tetrahedron \( ABCD \) such that the distances from \( I \) to each of the faces are equal, we need to determine the incenter of the tetrahedron. The incenter is the point where the four internal angle bisectors of the tetrahedron meet, and it is equidistant from all four faces.

First, we need to calculate the volume \( V \) of the tetrahedron \( ABCD \). We can use the Cayley-Menger determinant for this purpose. The determinant is given by:

\[
288 V^2 = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\

1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0

\]

Calculating the determinant, we find:

\[
288 V^2 = -288000 \implies V^2 = 1000 \implies V = 10\sqrt{10}
\]

Next, we need to find the surface area \( S \) of the tetrahedron. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four faces. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of each face. For face \( ABC \):

\[
s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]

The area \( K_{ABC} \) is given by:

\[
K_{ABC} = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)}
\]

Similarly, we can find the areas of the other faces \( ABD \), \( ACD \), and \( BCD \). However, due to the symmetry of the tetrahedron, all faces have the same area. Therefore, we can calculate the area of one face and multiply by 4.

Using the fact that the volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron is also given by:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
\]

we can find the height from any vertex to the opposite face. The inradius \( r \) is the distance from the incenter to any face, and it is given by:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{S}
\]

Since all faces have the same area, we can use the area of one face to find \( S \). The area of one face is:

\[
K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]

where \( s \) is the side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the edges. However, due to the symmetry and the given edge lengths, we can use the fact that the inradius is the same for all faces.

Finally, we find that the inradius \( r \) is:

\[
r = \frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}
\]

where \( m = 10 \), \( n = 10 \), and \( p = 1 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangular box as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area of the box is given by:

\[2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\]

The volume of the box is given by:

\[abc = 23\]

We need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The radius \(r\) is half of the space diagonal of the box, which is given by:

\[r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}\]

Thus, we need to find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\). We can use the identity for the square of a sum:

\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)\]

From the surface area equation, we know:

\[2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \implies ab + bc + ca = 27\]

So, we have:

\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54\]

To find \(a+b+c\), we use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial:

\[t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0\]

Substituting the known values:

\[t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0\]

We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of \(-23\), which are \(\pm 1, \pm 23\). Testing these values, we find:

For \(t = 1\):

\[1^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot 1^2 + 27 \cdot 1 - 23 = 1 - (a+b+c) + 27 - 23 = 5 - (a+b+c)\]

For \(t = -1\):

\[-1^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot (-1)^2 + 27 \cdot (-1) - 23 = -1 - (a+b+c) - 27 - 23 = -51 - (a+b+c)\]

For \(t = 23\):

\[23^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot 23^2 + 27 \cdot 23 - 23 = 12167 - (a+b+c) \cdot 529 + 621 - 23 = 12765 - (a+b+c) \cdot 529\]

For \(t = -23\):

\[-23^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot (-23)^2 + 27 \cdot (-23) - 23 = -12167 - (a+b+c) \cdot 529 - 621 - 23 = -12811 - (a+b+c) \cdot 529\]

None of these values are zero, so the polynomial does not have any rational roots. However, we can use numerical methods or further algebraic techniques to find the roots, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots \(a+b+c\) can be found using the polynomial's properties or symmetry.

Given the complexity, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the roots can be found directly from the polynomial's coefficients and the known values. We know:

\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 54\]

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the roots is related to the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time and the product of the roots. However, for the purpose of this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the roots is a known value that can be found by solving the polynomial or using numerical methods.

After finding \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we can find \(r^2\):

\[r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4}\]

Given the problem constraints and the known values, we find:

\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 50\]

Thus:

\[r^2 = \frac{50}{4} = \frac{25}{2}\]

The value of \(r^2\) is \(\frac{25}{2}\), where \(p = 25\) and \(q = 2\). Therefore, \(p + q = 25 + 2 = 27\).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\), we have:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation, \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we have:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(x^{10} = y^x\)
2. \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\)

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation to simplify them. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:

\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we can set them equal to each other:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

To solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), we cross-multiply:

\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25

"To determine the number of integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions.

First, let's define the winning and losing positions:
- A position is a **winning position** if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
- A position is a **losing position** if any move the player makes leaves the opponent in a winning position.

We start by identifying the base cases:
- \( n = 1 \): Alice wins by taking the last chip.
- \( n = 2 \): Alice wins by taking the last chip.
- \( n = 3 \): Alice wins by taking the last chip.
- \( n = 4 \): Alice wins by taking the last chip.
- \( n = 5 \): Alice wins by taking 1 chip, leaving Bob with 4 chips (a winning position for Alice).

From \( n = 5 \), we see that Alice can always force Bob into a position where Bob has a winning strategy. Therefore, \( n = 5 \) is a losing position for Alice.

Next, we continue this analysis:
- \( n = 6 \): Alice wins by taking 1 chip, leaving Bob with 5 chips (a losing position for Bob).
- \( n = 7 \): Alice wins by taking 1 chip, leaving Bob with 6 chips (a winning position for Alice).
- \( n = 8 \): Alice wins by taking 1 chip, leaving Bob with 7 chips (a winning position for Alice).
- \( n = 9 \): Alice wins by taking 1 chip, leaving Bob with 8 chips (a winning position for Alice).
- \( n = 10 \): Alice wins by taking 1 chip, leaving Bob with 9 chips (a winning position for Alice).

We observe a pattern: \( n = 5k \) (where \( k \) is a non-negative integer) are losing positions for Alice. This is because any move Alice makes will leave Bob with a number of chips that is not a multiple of 5, and Bob can always force Alice back to a multiple of 5.

To find the number of integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy, we need to count the number of integers \( n \) that are not multiples of 5.

The number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404
\]

Therefore, the number of integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are not multiples of 5 is:
\[
2024 - 404 = 1620
\]

Thus, the number of integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. We will do this by using conditional probability.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins the grand prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins a prize.

We need to find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. By the definition of conditional probability, we have:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]
Since winning the grand prize implies winning a prize, \( A \cap B = A \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Next, we calculate \( P(A) \), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. Jen wins the grand prize if the four numbers she chose are exactly the same as the four numbers chosen at random. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} \). Since there is only one way for Jen's chosen numbers to match the four numbers chosen at random, we have:
\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210}
\]

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that Jen wins a prize. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her chosen numbers are among the four numbers chosen at random. We will use the complement rule to find this probability. The complement of event \( B \) is the event that fewer than two of Jen's chosen numbers are among the four numbers chosen at random. There are two cases to consider for the complement:
1. None of Jen's chosen numbers are among the four numbers chosen at random.
2. Exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the four numbers chosen at random.

**Case 1: None of Jen's chosen numbers are among the four numbers chosen at random.**

If none of Jen's chosen numbers are among the four numbers chosen at random, then all four numbers chosen at random must be from the remaining 6 numbers. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 6 is \( \binom{6}{4} \). Therefore, the probability for this case is:
\[
\frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14}
\]

**Case 2: Exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the four numbers chosen at random.**

If exactly one of Jen's chosen numbers is among the four numbers chosen at random, then one number is chosen from Jen's 4 numbers and the other three numbers are chosen from the remaining 6 numbers. The number of ways to choose 1 number out of 4 and 3 numbers out of 6 is \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} \). Therefore, the probability for this case is:
\[
\frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \cdot 20}{210} = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21}
\]

Adding the probabilities of these two cases, we get the probability of the complement of event \( B \):
\[
\frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42}
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jen wins a prize is:
\[
P(B) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

Now, we can find \( P(A \mid B) \):
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

The probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Since 1 and 115 are coprime, we have \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the shapes involved.

First, we note that \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are rectangles, and the points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear. Additionally, the points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle. This implies that quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic.

Given the dimensions:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

We need to find the length of \(CE\).

### Step 1: Determine the coordinates of the points
Let's place the rectangles in the coordinate plane for convenience:
- Place \(D\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- Place \(C\) at \((16, 0)\) since \(BC = 16\).
- Place \(B\) at \((16, 107)\) since \(AB = 107\).
- Place \(A\) at \((0, 107)\).

### Step 2: Place points \(E\) and \(F\)
Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear, \(E\) and \(F\) must lie on the x-axis. Let \(E\) be at \((x, 0)\) and \(F\) be at \((x + 17, 0)\) since \(EF = 17\).

### Step 3: Use the cyclic quadrilateral property
Since \(A, D, H, G\) are cyclic, the opposite angles of quadrilateral \(ADHG\) sum to \(180^\circ\). This property will help us find the coordinates of \(H\) and \(G\).

### Step 4: Determine the coordinates of \(H\) and \(G\)
- Place \(H\) at \((x, y)\) and \(G\) at \((x + 17, y)\) since \(FG = 17\).

### Step 5: Use the circle property
The points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle, so the power of a point theorem can be applied. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral intersect at right angles if they are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

### Step 6: Calculate the length of \(CE\)
Since \(E\) and \(C\) are on the x-axis, the length \(CE\) is simply the distance between \(E\) and \(C\):
\[ CE = |x - 16| \]

### Step 7: Use the given dimensions to find \(x\)
We know that \(E\) and \(F\) are on the x-axis, and \(F\) is 17 units to the right of \(E\). We also know that \(A, D, H, G\) are cyclic, which implies that the diagonals \(AG\) and \(DH\) intersect at right angles.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABE\):
\[ AE^2 + BE^2 = AB^2 \]
\[ (x - 0)^2 + (0 - 107)^2 = 107^2 \]
\[ x^2 + 107^2 = 107^2 \]
\[ x^2 = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

Thus, \(E\) is at \((0, 0)\), which is the same as \(D\).

### Step 8: Calculate \(CE\)
Since \(E\) is at \((0, 0)\) and \(C\) is at \((16, 0)\):
\[ CE = |0 - 16| = 16 \]

Therefore, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To find the number of paths of length 16 from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Path Representation**: Each path consists of exactly 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. A change in direction occurs when an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R.

2. **Identifying Direction Changes**: If a path changes direction exactly four times, it means there are exactly four R's followed by U's and four U's followed by R's. This implies that the sequence of moves can be divided into five segments of consecutive R's and U's. For example, a valid sequence might look like RRRUURRRUUURRRU.

3. **Counting the Sequences**: We need to count the number of ways to arrange these five segments. Each segment is either a block of R's or a block of U's, and there are exactly four changes between these blocks. The number of ways to arrange 5 segments (where each segment is either R or U) is the same as the number of ways to arrange 4 changes between 5 segments, which is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of 7 for the changes (since the first segment can be either R or U, and the changes must occur between the segments).

4. **Calculating the Number of Sequences**: The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 7 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{4}\). However, we need to consider that the first segment can be either R or U, so we multiply by 2. Therefore, the total number of sequences is \(2 \times \binom{7}{4}\).

5. **Final Calculation**: The binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{4}\) is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35

   Therefore, the total number of paths is:
   \[
   2 \times 35 = 70

"To find the maximum real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). This is because the magnitude of \(z\) is 4, and any complex number on the circle of radius 4 can be written in this form.

First, we substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).

We now expand each term:
\[
4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize this real part, we need to find the maximum value of the function \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, and its maximum value is given by the magnitude of the vector \((324, -432)\):
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given the information about the arrangement of circles and their radii.

First, let's analyze the arrangement of the circles. We have 8 circles of radius 34 that are tangentially connected in a chain, and two additional circles of radius 34 that are tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\), respectively. This forms a configuration where the centers of these 10 circles lie on a straight line parallel to \(AC\).

The distance between the centers of two consecutive circles of radius 34 is \(2 \times 34 = 68\). Since there are 8 circles in the chain, the total distance between the centers of the first and the last circle in the chain is:
\[
7 \times 68 = 476
\]
This distance is also the length of the segment parallel to \(AC\) that is 68 units away from \(AC\) and lies between the points where the two additional circles are tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\).

Now, let's consider the 2024 circles of radius 1 that can be arranged in the same manner. The distance between the centers of two consecutive circles of radius 1 is \(2 \times 1 = 2\). Since there are 2024 circles in the chain, the total distance between the centers of the first and the last circle in the chain is:
\[
2023 \times 2 = 4046
\]
This distance is also the length of the segment parallel to \(AC\) that is 2 units away from \(AC\) and lies between the points where the two additional circles are tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\).

The inradius \(r\) of triangle \(ABC\) is the distance from the incenter to side \(AC\). Since the two additional circles of radius 34 are tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\), the distance from the incenter to \(AB\) and \(BC\) is \(34 + r\). The distance between the points where the two additional circles are tangent to \(AB\) and \(BC\) is the same as the length of the segment parallel to \(AC\) that is \(34 + r\) units away from \(AC\).

The ratio of the distances between the centers of the circles in the two configurations is the same as the ratio of the radii of the circles:
\[
\frac{4046}{476} = \frac{2023}{238} = \frac{289}{34} = \frac{17}{2}
\]
This ratio is also the ratio of the distances from the incenter to the sides of the triangle:
\[
\frac{34 + r}{34} = \frac{17}{2}
\]
Solving for \(r\):
\[
34 + r = 578 \implies r = 544

The inradius of triangle \(ABC\) is \(544\). Since \(544\) is already in its simplest form, we have \(m = 544\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 544 + 1 = 545\).

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus. The equation of the hyperbola is:

\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]

Since the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be represented as \((x_1, y_1)\), \((-x_1, -y_1)\), \((-x_1, y_1)\), and \((x_1, -y_1)\) respectively. The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is given by:

\[
BD = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}
\]

Thus, \(BD^2\) is:

\[
BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)

Since \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the hyperbola's equation:

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

We can express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):

\[
y_1^2 = 24\left(\frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24}{20}x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24

Substituting \(y_1^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\):

\[
BD^2 = 4\left(x_1^2 + \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11}{5}x_1^2 - 24\right) = \frac{44}{5}x_1^2 - 96
\]

To find the minimum value of \(BD^2\), we need to determine the minimum value of \(x_1^2\). Since \(x_1^2\) must be greater than or equal to 20 (from the hyperbola equation), the minimum value of \(x_1^2\) is 20. Substituting \(x_1^2 = 20\) into the expression for \(BD^2\):

BD^2 = \frac{44}{5}(20) - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80

"To solve for \( AB \cdot AC \) in the given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \), incenter \( I \), and the conditions \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \), we can use several geometric properties and formulas.

First, recall that the distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus,
\[
OI = \sqrt{13}
\]

Next, since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we can use the fact that in a triangle, the product of the segments of the angle bisector from the vertex to the points where it intersects the circumcircle and the incircle is equal to the product of the other two sides of the triangle. However, a simpler approach is to use the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of its sides and inradius, and the formula for the area in terms of its circumradius and sides.

The area \( K \) of the triangle can be expressed as:
\[
K = r \cdot s
\]
where \( s \) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. It can also be expressed as:
\[
K = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
where \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), and \( c = AB \).

Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]
Substituting \( r = 6 \) and \( R = 13 \), we have:
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52}
\]
\[
abc = 312s
\]

We also know that the semiperimeter \( s \) can be expressed in terms of the sides as:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]

To find \( AB \cdot AC \), we need to use the fact that in a triangle with \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the sides satisfy a specific relationship. One such relationship is:
\[
AB \cdot AC = c \cdot b = \frac{abc}{a} = \frac{312s}{a}
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that in a triangle with \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the product of the sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) can be directly found using the formula:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 4R^2 - 4Rr
\]
Substituting \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we get:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 4 \cdot 13^2 - 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 4 \cdot 169 - 4 \cdot 78 = 676 - 312 = 364

"To find the number of triples of non-negative integers \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - abc.
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - abc = 6,000,000.
\]

We also know that \(a + b + c = 300\). Let's consider the case where one of the variables is zero. Without loss of generality, assume \(c = 0\). Then the equations simplify to:
\[
a + b = 300 \quad \text{and} \quad ab(a + b) = 6,000,000.
\]
Substituting \(a + b = 300\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
ab \cdot 300 = 6,000,000 \implies ab = 20,000.
\]
Now we need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = 300\) and \(ab = 20,000\). These pairs are the roots of the quadratic equation:
\[
t^2 - 300t + 20,000 = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 20,000}}{2}\), we get:
\[
t = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]
Thus, the solutions are:
\[
t = 200 \quad \text{and} \quad t = 100.
\]
So, the pairs \((a, b)\) are \((200, 100)\) and \((100, 200)\). Therefore, the triples \((a, b, c)\) are \((200, 100, 0)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\), \((0, 100, 200)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), and \((100, 0, 200)\).

There are 6 such triples. To confirm that there are no other solutions, we consider the case where \(a, b, c\) are all positive. In this case, we need to check if the equation \((a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - abc = 6,000,000\) can be satisfied with \(a + b + c = 300\). However, it is known that for positive integers \(a, b, c\) such that \(a + b + c = 300\), the expression \((a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - abc\) is maximized when \(a, b, c\) are as close to each other as possible, and it is less than 6,000,000. Therefore, there are no other solutions.

Thus, the number of triples of non-negative integers \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given equations is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",601,"[601, '601']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given points and the family of segments \(\mathcal{F}\). The points are \(O = (0,0)\), \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\), and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The family \(\mathcal{F}\) consists of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1, where \(P\) is on the x-axis and \(Q\) is on the y-axis.

First, we need to find the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, the equation of \(\overline{AB}\) is:
\[
y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we consider a segment \(\overline{PQ}\ in \(\mathcal{F}\). Let \(P = (a, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, b)\). Since the length of \(\overline{PQ}\) is 1, we have:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 1 \implies a^2 + b^2 = 1
\]
The equation of the line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is:
\[
y = -\frac{b}{a}x + b
\]

We need to find the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not lie on any other segment \(\overline{PQ}\) except \(\overline{AB}\). This point \(C\) must be the point where the line \(\overline{AB}\) is tangent to the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). The distance from the origin \(O\) to the line \(\overline{AB}\) is given by the formula for the distance from a point to a line:
\[
\text{distance} = \frac{|0 + 0 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|}{\sqrt{1 + (\sqrt{3})^2}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Since the radius of the circle is 1, the point \(C\) is at a distance of 1 from the origin. Therefore, the coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[
OC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Thus, \(OC^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{16}\).

Finally, we have \(p = 3\) and \(q = 16\), so \(p + q = 3 + 16 = 19\).

"To find the residue of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) when divided by 1000, we start by considering the properties of the 13th roots of unity. Let \(\omega\) be a primitive 13th root of unity, so \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(1 \leq k < 13\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the product becomes \((2-2\cdot1+1^2)\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

Next, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\). To do this, we can use the fact that the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) has roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We can express the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\) as the resultant of the polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\).

The resultant of two polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) can be computed using the determinant of their Sylvester matrix. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial can be found by evaluating a related polynomial at a specific point.

In this case, we can use the fact that the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\) is equal to the constant term of the polynomial \(P(x)^{12}\) divided by the leading coefficient of \(Q(x)\) raised to the degree of \(P(x)\). The constant term of \(P(x)^{12}\) is \(2^{12} = 4096\), and the leading coefficient of \(Q(x)\) is 1, so the product is \(4096\).

Finally, we need to find the residue of 4096 when divided by 1000. We do this by computing \(4096 \mod 1000\):
\[4096 \div 1000 = 4 \text{ remainder } 96.\]
Therefore, the residue is \(\boxed{096}\).","[96, '096']",321,"[321, '321']",False

"To find the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the vertices of the dodecagon**: A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, which we can label as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \).

2. **Understanding the structure of rectangles**: A rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of vertices such that the vertices are not adjacent and do not share the same side. This means we need to select two pairs of vertices that are not directly connected by an edge.

3. **Counting the vertices**: We can choose any two vertices from the 12 vertices to form the corners of the rectangle. However, we need to ensure that the selected vertices do not form a side of the dodecagon.

4. **Choosing vertices**: Let's denote the vertices of the rectangle as \( A_i, A_j, A_k, A_l \) such that \( i < j < k < l \). The vertices must be chosen in such a way that they do not form a side of the dodecagon.

5. **Calculating combinations**: We can choose 4 vertices from the 12 vertices in \( \binom{12}{4} \) ways. However, we need to subtract the cases where the chosen vertices form a side of the dodecagon.

6. **Excluding adjacent vertices**: The number of ways to choose 4 vertices such that they form a side of the dodecagon is equal to the number of sides of the dodecagon, which is 12. Each side can be considered as a rectangle with sides of length 1 and 0.

7. **Calculating valid rectangles**: The total number of rectangles can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total rectangles} = \binom{12}{4} - 12

8. **Calculating \( \binom{12}{4} \)**:
   \[
   \binom{12}{4} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 495

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in its exponential form. The system is:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the equations. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). The integers \(m\) and \(n\) are 39 and 4, respectively, and their sum is:

"To find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, we start by expressing \( N \) in the form \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are digits and \( a \neq 0 \).

We need to check the divisibility of the following numbers by 7:
1. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)
2. \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \) (this is \( N \))
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \) (this is \( N \))
5. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \) (this is \( N \))

First, we note that \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), and \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \). Therefore, the conditions become:
1. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

From the second condition, we get:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]

From the third condition, we get:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b + d \equiv -3c \pmod{7} \]

Equating the two expressions for \( 6a + 2b + d \), we get:
\[ 4 \equiv -3c \pmod{7} \implies 4 \equiv 4c \pmod{7} \implies c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Since \( c \) is a digit, \( c = 1 \). Substituting \( c = 1 \) into the first condition, we get:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b + 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \implies 6a + 2b \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \implies 3a + b \equiv \frac{3}{2} \pmod{7} \]

To solve \( 3a + b \equiv \frac{3}{2} \pmod{7} \), we need the modular inverse of 2 modulo 7, which is 4. Therefore:
\[ 3a + b \equiv 3 \cdot 4 \pmod{7} \implies 3a + b \equiv 12 \pmod{7} \implies 3a + b \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

We now need to find the largest \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( 3a + b \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \). The largest possible value for \( a \) is 9, so we substitute \( a = 9 \):
\[ 3 \cdot 9 + b \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \implies 27 + b \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \implies 6 + b \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \implies b \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \implies b \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

Thus, \( b = 6 \). Therefore, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is:
\[ N = 1000 \cdot 9 + 100 \cdot 6 + 10 \cdot 1 + 1 = 9611 \]

We now find \( Q \) and \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000:
\[ Q = \left\lfloor \frac{9611}{1000} \right\rfloor = 9 \]
\[ R = 9611 - 9 \cdot 1000 = 611 \]

Finally, we find \( Q + R \):

When the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) externally along a circle, the radius of this circle is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the radius of the sphere. The center of the torus is 6 units away from the axis of rotation, and the radius of the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 + 6 = 17 units.

The radius of the circle of tangency \( r_i \) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus minus the radius of the sphere:
\[
r_i = 17 - 11 = 6

When the torus \( T \) is tangent to the sphere \( S \) externally along another circle, the radius of this circle is the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus plus the radius of the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5 units.

The key insight is that the placement of chips is equivalent to choosing a subset of rows and a subset of columns, and then placing chips of the same color in the intersection of these rows and columns. The color of the chips in each block is determined by the color of the chips in the chosen rows and columns.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Choose the rows and columns:**
   - There are \(2^5 = 32\) subsets of rows (including the empty subset).
   - There are \(2^5 = 32\) subsets of columns (including the empty subset).

2. **Determine the color of the chips:**
   - For each pair of subsets of rows and columns, we can choose the color of the chips in the intersection of these rows and columns. There are 2 choices for the color (black or white).

3. **Exclude the empty configuration:**
   - The empty configuration, where no rows and no columns are chosen, is not valid because it does not satisfy the condition that any additional chip placed would violate one or both of the conditions. Therefore, we exclude this configuration.

The total number of valid configurations is:
\[
(32 - 1)(32 - 1) \times 2 = 31 \times 31 \times 2 = 1922
\]

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{1922}\).","[1922, '1922']",902,"[902, '902']",False
