"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we start by using the Power of a Point theorem. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one secant line and the other secant line drawn from \(D\) are equal. In this problem, \(D\) is the point where the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\) to the circumcircle \(\omega\) intersect, and \(AD\) is a secant line intersecting the circle at points \(P\) and \(A\).

First, we need to find the length of \(BD\) and \(CD\). Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\), the lengths of the tangents from a point outside a circle to the points of tangency are equal. Therefore, \(BD = CD\).

Using the Power of a Point theorem at point \(D\), we have:
\[BD^2 = AB \cdot AC\]
\[CD^2 = AB \cdot AC\]

Substituting the given side lengths:
\[BD^2 = 5 \cdot 10 = 50\]
\[CD^2 = 5 \cdot 10 = 50\]

Thus, \(BD = CD = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}\).

Now, we use the Power of a Point theorem again at point \(A\):
\[AD \cdot AP = AB \cdot AC\]

We already know \(AB \cdot AC = 50\). To find \(AD\), we use the fact that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents from \(B\) and \(C\), and the length \(AD\) can be found using the formula for the length of the tangent segment from a point to a circle:
\[AD = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{AB + AC}\]

Substituting the given side lengths:
\[AD = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{5 + 10} = \frac{50}{15} = \frac{10}{3}\]

Now, we substitute \(AD\) and \(AB \cdot AC\) into the Power of a Point theorem:
\[\frac{10}{3} \cdot AP = 50\]

Solving for \(AP\):
\[AP = \frac{50 \cdot 3}{10} = 15\]

Thus, \(AP = \frac{15}{1}\), where \(m = 15\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 15 + 1 = 16\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that after rotating the regular octagon, all the blue vertices will be in the positions where the red vertices were initially, given that each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability.

First, let's consider the total number of possible colorings of the octagon. Since each of the 8 vertices can be either red or blue, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings.

Next, we need to count the number of colorings where all the blue vertices are in the positions where the red vertices were initially after some rotation. This means that the pattern of red and blue vertices must be such that rotating the octagon by any multiple of \(45^\circ\) (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 positions) results in the same pattern.

The only way this can happen is if the pattern is symmetric and repeats every 8 positions. The only such pattern is the one where all vertices are the same color. There are exactly 2 such patterns: one where all vertices are red and one where all vertices are blue.

Therefore, there are 2 colorings that satisfy the condition. The probability of such a coloring is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is:
\[
\frac{2}{256} = \frac{1}{128}
\]

In the problem, this probability is given as \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers. Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 128\). Thus, \(m + n = 1 + 128 = 129\).

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and then find the points of intersection of the graphs of the given equations.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \left| x \right| \).

So, \( f(x) \) is a piecewise linear function that looks like a ""W"" shape with vertices at \( \left( \pm \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \) and \( (0, \frac{1}{2}) \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) can be broken down into cases based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - \left| x \right| \).

So, \( g(x) \) is a piecewise linear function that looks like a ""W"" shape with vertices at \( \left( \pm \frac{1}{4}, 0 \right) \) and \( (0, \frac{1}{4}) \).

### Step 3: Define the given equations
The given equations are:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]

### Step 4: Determine the range of \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) both range from \(-1\) to \(1\), we need to find the range of \( f(x) \) on \([-1, 1]\):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \), which ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \left| x \right| \), which ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

So, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) both range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Step 5: Determine the range of \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) both range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\), we need to find the range of \( g(x) \) on \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \), which ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - \left| x \right| \), which ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

So, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) both range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

### Step 6: Determine the range of \( y \) and \( x \)
Since \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \), \( y \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).
Since \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), \( x \) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).

### Step 7: Find the points of intersection
The equations \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are symmetric and periodic. By analyzing the symmetry and periodicity, we can see that there are 4 points of intersection in the interval \([0, 1] \times [0, 1]\).

Therefore, the number of points of intersection is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or one of these factors must be divisible by \( p^2 \). However, since \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) are not integers, we need to consider the polynomial modulo \( p \).

Let's test small prime numbers to find the smallest \( p \).

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]
   If \( n \) is even, \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \).
   If \( n \) is odd, \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \).
   Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2 \) but not by \( 4 \).

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{3}.
   \]
   If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
   If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
   If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), \( n^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
   Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is not divisible by \( 3 \).

3. **For \( p = 5 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{5}.
   \]
   If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), \( n^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
   If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), \( n^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), \( n^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), \( n^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), \( n^4 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
   Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is not divisible by \( 5 \).

4. **For \( p = 17 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{17}.
   \]
   If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{17} \), \( n^4 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \).
   If \( n \equiv 13 \pmod{17} \), \( n^4 \equiv 28561 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \).
   If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \), \( n^4 \equiv 16 \pmod{17} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \).
   If \( n \equiv 15 \pmod{17} \), \( n^4 \equiv 50625 \equiv 16 \pmod{17} \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 17 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \).
   Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17 \) and \( 17^2 = 289 \).

Thus, the smallest prime number \( p \) is \( 17 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \). We already know that \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \) or \( m \equiv 15 \pmod{17} \) satisfy \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \). We need to check if either of these values satisfies \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \).

If \( m = 2 \), then \( m^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \), which is not divisible by \( 289 \).

If \( m = 15 \), then \( m^4 + 1 = 50625 + 1 = 50626 \). We need to check if \( 50626 \) is divisible by \( 289 \):
\[
50626 \div 289 = 175.00345454545454,
\]
which is not an integer. Therefore, \( m = 15 \) is not a solution.

We need to find the next \( m \) that satisfies \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \). We can use the fact that \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \) or \( m \equiv 15 \pmod{17} \) and check the next values.

If \( m = 17 \), then \( m^4 + 1 = 83521 + 1 = 83522 \). We need to check if \( 83522 \) is divisible by \( 289 \):
\[
83522 \div 289 = 288.55017301038064,
\]
which is not an integer. Therefore, \( m = 17 \) is not a solution.

If \( m = 34 \), then \( m^4 + 1 = 1336336 + 1 = 1336337 \). We need to check if \( 1336337 \) is divisible by \( 289 \):
\[
1336337 \div 289 = 4619,
\]
which is an integer. Therefore, \( m = 34 \) is a solution.

Thus, the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",110,"[110, '110']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can completely contain a rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius \( r \) is half the length of the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \( d \) of a rectangular box with dimensions \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is given by:

\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]

Thus, the radius \( r \) is:

\[ r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2} \]

We need to find \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) given the surface area and volume of the box. The surface area \( S \) and volume \( V \) of the box are:

\[ S = 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \]
\[ V = abc = 23 \]

We can use the identity for the square of the sum of the sides of a rectangular box:

\[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \]

From the surface area, we have:

\[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \implies ab + bc + ca = 27 \]

Substituting this into the identity, we get:

\[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 54 \]

We also know that \( abc = 23 \). To find \( a + b + c \), we can use the fact that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the roots of the cubic polynomial:

\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0 \]

We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By trial and error or using numerical methods, we can find that the roots are approximately \( a \approx 1 \), \( b \approx 2 \), and \( c \approx 11.5 \). However, for exact calculation, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots \( a + b + c \) can be found using the polynomial's properties or numerical methods, but for simplicity, we can use the known values to find \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \).

Using the approximate values, we can calculate:

\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \approx 1^2 + 2^2 + 11.5^2 = 1 + 4 + 132.25 = 137.25 \]

However, for exact calculation, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots \( a + b + c \) can be found using the polynomial's properties or numerical methods, but for simplicity, we can use the known values to find \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \).

Using the exact values, we can find:

\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 137 \]

Thus, the radius \( r \) is:

\[ r = \frac{\sqrt{137}}{2} \]

The square of the radius \( r^2 \) is:

\[ r^2 = \frac{137}{4} \]

Here, \( p = 137 \) and \( q = 4 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 137 + 4 = 141 \).

"To solve the given problem, we start with the equations provided:

\[
\log_x\left(y^x\right) = 10
\]
\[
\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right) = 10

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
y^x = x^{10}
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
x^{4y} = y^{10}
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \( y^x = x^{10} \)
2. \( x^{4y} = y^{10} \)

We will solve these equations step by step. Let's start by taking the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation.

For the first equation:

\[
\ln(y^x) = \ln(x^{10})
\]
\[
x \ln(y) = 10 \ln(x)
\]
\[
\frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{10}{x}

For the second equation:

\[
\ln(x^{4y}) = \ln(y^{10})
\]
\[
4y \ln(x) = 10 \ln(y)
\]
\[
\frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}

"To determine the probability that the player wins the main prize given that they have won any prize, we need to calculate the probability that the player's 4 chosen numbers are all among the 4 winning numbers, given that at least 2 of the chosen numbers are among the winning numbers.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least 2 of them are among the winning numbers. We will use the complementary counting method. First, we calculate the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that fewer than 2 of them are among the winning numbers.

1. **Number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that none of them are among the winning numbers:**
\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15
\]

2. **Number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that exactly 1 of them is among the winning numbers:**
\[
\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \cdot \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 4 \cdot 20 = 80
\]

Adding these together, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that fewer than 2 of them are among the winning numbers is:
\[

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least 2 of them are among the winning numbers is:

Since the probability is given in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, we have \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 115 = 116\).

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the rectangles and the circle.

First, we note that rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are such that points \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear. Additionally, points \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(G\) lie on a circle. This implies that quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic.

Given the dimensions:
- \(BC = 16\)
- \(AB = 107\)
- \(FG = 17\)
- \(EF = 184\)

we can find the lengths of the other sides of the rectangles:
- \(CD = AB = 107\)
- \(DA = BC = 16\)
- \(GH = EF = 184\)
- \(EH = FG = 17\)

Since \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(G\) are cyclic, we can use the Power of a Point theorem at point \(C\) with respect to the circle. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of one secant line and the other secant line are equal. Here, the secant lines are \(CD\) and \(CE\) intersecting the circle at \(D\) and \(E\) respectively, and \(CH\) and \(CF\) intersecting the circle at \(H\) and \(F\) respectively.

Thus, we have:
\[CD \cdot CE = CH \cdot CF\]

We know:
\[CD = 107\]
\[CH = CD + DH = 107 + 16 = 123\]
\[CF = CD + DF = 107 + 17 = 124\]

Substituting these values into the Power of a Point theorem, we get:
\[107 \cdot CE = 123 \cdot 124\]

First, we calculate \(123 \cdot 124\):
\[123 \cdot 124 = 123 \cdot (120 + 4) = 123 \cdot 120 + 123 \cdot 4 = 14760 + 492 = 15252\]

Solving for \(CE\):
\[CE = \frac{15252}{107} = 142.54205607476636\]

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get:

"To solve the problem of finding the number of 16-length paths on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction only at the corners of the grid, we need to consider the following:

1. **Path Length and Direction Changes**:
   - Each path consists of exactly 16 steps.
   - Since the path starts at the bottom-left corner and ends at the top-right corner, it must include exactly 8 right steps and 8 up steps.
   - The path can change direction only at the corners of the grid, meaning it can only change from right to up or from up to right at the grid points.

2. **Path Representation**:
   - We can represent each path as a sequence of 8 'R' (right) steps and 8 'U' (up) steps.
   - The problem then reduces to finding the number of valid sequences of 8 'R's and 8 'U's where the sequence can be divided into segments of 'R's and 'U's, and each segment corresponds to a straight line segment on the grid.

3. **Counting Valid Sequences**:
   - The number of valid sequences is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange 8 'R's and 8 'U's such that no two 'R's are adjacent and no two 'U's are adjacent.
   - This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and can be solved using the concept of Catalan numbers. The \(n\)-th Catalan number \(C_n\) is given by:
     \[
     C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}
     \]
   - For \(n = 8\), the 8th Catalan number is:
     \[
     C_8 = \frac{1}{9} \binom{16}{8}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient**:
   - The binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\) is:
     \[
     \binom{16}{8} = \frac{16!}{8!8!} = 12870
     \]
   - Therefore, the 8th Catalan number is:

"To find the maximum real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 36\sin\theta) + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i.
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To maximize this real part, we need to maximize the function \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\) and \(\phi\) is an angle such that \(\cos\phi = \frac{324}{R}\) and \(\sin\phi = \frac{432}{R}\).

First, we calculate \(R\):
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) is \(R = 540\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of the triangle \(ABC\) given that the radii of the eight smaller circles are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, and the radii of the two larger circles are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1 as well. The radii of the smaller circles are \(r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6, r_7, r_8\) and the radii of the larger circles are \(R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5, R_6, R_7, R_8, R_9, R_{10}, R_{11}, R_{12}, R_{13}, R_{14}, R_{15}, R_{16}\).

First, let's find the radii of the smaller circles. Since the radii are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, we can write:
\[ r_1 = r, \quad r_2 = r+1, \quad r_3 = r+2, \quad r_4 = r+3, \quad r_5 = r+4, \quad r_6 = r+5, \quad r_7 = r+6, \quad r_8 = r+7. \]
The sum of the radii of the smaller circles is:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 + r_6 + r_7 + r_8 = 8r + 28. \]

Next, let's find the radii of the larger circles. Since the radii are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, we can write:
\[ R_1 = R, \quad R_2 = R+1, \quad R_3 = R+2, \quad R_4 = R+3, \quad R_5 = R+4, \quad R_6 = R+5, \quad R_7 = R+6, \quad R_8 = R+7, \quad R_9 = R+8, \quad R_{10} = R+9, \quad R_{11} = R+10, \quad R_{12} = R+11, \quad R_{13} = R+12, \quad R_{14} = R+13, \quad R_{15} = R+14, \quad R_{16} = R+15. \]
The sum of the radii of the larger circles is:
\[ R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 + R_5 + R_6 + R_7 + R_8 + R_9 + R_{10} + R_{11} + R_{12} + R_{13} + R_{14} + R_{15} + R_{16} = 16R + 120. \]

The sum of the radii of all 24 circles is:
\[ (8r + 28) + (16R + 120) = 8r + 16R + 148. \]

The sum of the radii of the circles is also equal to the sum of the distances from the incenter of the triangle to the sides of the triangle, which is equal to the inradius \(r\) times the semiperimeter \(s\) of the triangle. Therefore, we have:
\[ 8r + 16R + 148 = r \cdot s. \]

Since the radii of the smaller circles are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 34, we have:
\[ r_8 - r_1 = 7 \cdot 34 = 238. \]
Thus, \(r + 7 = r + 238\), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the sum of the radii of the smaller circles is equal to the sum of the radii of the larger circles, which is:
\[ 8r + 28 = 16R + 120. \]
Solving for \(R\), we get:
\[ 8r + 28 = 16R + 120 \implies 8r - 16R = 92 \implies r - 2R = 11.5. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\).

The hyperbola is given by:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]
This is a hyperbola centered at the origin with a horizontal transverse axis. The asymptotes of this hyperbola are given by:
\[
y = \pm \frac{\sqrt{24}}{\sqrt{20}} x = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{20}} x = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x
\]

Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola, its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other and intersect at the center of the hyperbola, which is the origin. Let the diagonals be \(AC\) and \(BD\). The length of \(BD\) is what we need to maximize, given that \(BD^2\) is less than the maximum possible value.

The vertices of the rhombus can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of the intersection points of the diagonals with the hyperbola. Let the coordinates of the intersection points of \(AC\) with the hyperbola be \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((-x_1, -y_1)\), and the coordinates of the intersection points of \(BD\) with the hyperbola be \((x_2, y_2)\) and \((-x_2, -y_2)\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the product of the slopes of the diagonals is \(-1\). The slope of \(AC\) is \(\frac{y_1}{x_1}\) and the slope of \(BD\) is \(\frac{y_2}{x_2}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{y_1}{x_1} \cdot \frac{y_2}{x_2} = -1 \implies y_1 y_2 = -x_1 x_2
\]

The points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) lie on the hyperbola, so they satisfy the hyperbola's equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(4x_2^2 + 4y_2^2\). Using the relationship \(y_1 y_2 = -x_1 x_2\), we can express \(y_2\) in terms of \(x_2\):
\[
y_2 = -\frac{x_1 x_2}{y_1}
\]

Substituting \(y_2\) into the hyperbola's equation for \(BD\):
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{\left(-\frac{x_1 x_2}{y_1}\right)^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{x_1^2 x_2^2}{24 y_1^2} = 1
\]

Using the hyperbola's equation for \(AC\):
\[
y_1^2 = \frac{24}{20} x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5} x_1^2 - 24
\]

Substituting \(y_1^2\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{x_1^2 x_2^2}{24 \left(\frac{6}{5} x_1^2 - 24\right)} = 1
\]

Simplifying the expression:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{x_2^2}{24 \left(\frac{6}{5} - \frac{24}{x_1^2}\right)} = 1
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to consider the maximum possible value of \(x_2^2\). The maximum value of \(x_2^2\) occurs when the hyperbola is at its asymptotes, which is not possible for a rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola. However, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is achieved when the rhombus is a square, and the diagonals are equal.

For a square inscribed in the hyperbola, the diagonals are equal, and the length of each diagonal is:
\[
BD = 2\sqrt{20 + 24} = 2\sqrt{44} = 4\sqrt{11}
\]

Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:
\[
BD^2 = (4\sqrt{11})^2 = 16 \cdot 11 = 176

"To solve for \( AB \cdot AC \) in the given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we start by using the given conditions and properties of the triangle.

1. **Given Data:**
   - Circumradius \( R = 13 \)
   - Inradius \( r = 6 \)
   - \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \)

2. **Using the Perpendicularity Condition:**
   The condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) implies that the incenter \( I \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OA \). This circle is known as the Apollonius circle of \( \triangle ABC \) with respect to vertex \( A \).

3. **Distance Between \( O \) and \( I \):**
   The distance \( OI \) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle can be expressed using the formula:
   \[
   OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   OI = \sqrt{13}
   \]

4. **Using the Perpendicularity Condition Again:**
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the length \( IA \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OIA \):
   \[
   IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2
   \]
   Here, \( OA = R = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \):
   \[
   IA^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2 = 13^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   IA^2 + 13 = 169
   \]
   \[
   IA^2 = 156
   \]
   \[
   IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}

5. **Using the Inradius and Semiperimeter:**
   The inradius \( r \) is also given by:
   \[
   r = \frac{A}{s}
   \]
   where \( A \) is the area of the triangle and \( s \) is the semiperimeter. The area \( A \) can also be expressed as:
   \[
   A = \frac{abc}{4R}
   \]
   where \( a = BC \), \( b = CA \), and \( c = AB \). The semiperimeter \( s \) is:
   \[
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
   \]

6. **Using the Product \( AB \cdot AC \):**
   We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \). Using the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \) and the properties of the triangle, we can use the formula for the product of two sides in terms of the circumradius and inradius:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = \frac{c \cdot b}{\sin C}

   However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that in a triangle with \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be directly related to the circumradius and inradius:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = 4Rr
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 312

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. \]

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca). \]
Substituting \( a + b + c = 300 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000. \]
Solving for \( ab + bc + ca \), we find:
\[ ab + bc + ca = \frac{6,000,000}{300} = 20,000. \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300, \]
\[ ab + bc + ca = 20,000. \]

We need to find the values of \( a, b, \) and \( c \). Let's assume \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[ t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0. \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0. \]

To find \( abc \), we can use the fact that \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are integers. Let's try some possible values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \). Suppose \( a = 100 \). Then:
\[ b + c = 200, \]
\[ 100b + 100c + bc = 20,000. \]
Substituting \( b + c = 200 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 100(200) + bc = 20,000, \]
\[ 20,000 + bc = 20,000, \]
\[ bc = 0. \]
This implies that either \( b = 0 \) or \( c = 0 \). Without loss of generality, let \( b = 0 \). Then \( c = 200 \). Therefore, the solution is:
\[ (a, b, c) = (100, 0, 200). \]

The product \( abc \) is:
\[ abc = 100 \cdot 0 \cdot 200 = 0. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the 13th root of unity \(\omega\), where \(\omega \neq 1\) and \(\omega^{13} = 1\). We need to find the value of the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) modulo 1000.

First, observe that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity. The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:
\[
(x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0.
\]
Thus, the 13th roots of unity, except 1, are the roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]
Notice that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the product becomes:
\[
(2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1^2) \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

Next, consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\). The roots of \(P(x)\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to evaluate the product:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}).
\]

To simplify this, we use the fact that \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity. We can rewrite the expression inside the product as:
\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}.
\]

We can use the identity for the sum of a geometric series to find the value of the product. The polynomial \(P(x)\) can be written as:
\[
P(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}.
\]

The product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) can be evaluated by considering the polynomial \(Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) and its roots. The value of the product is the constant term of the polynomial \(Q(2 - 2x + x^2)\) evaluated at \(x = 1\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) such that the largest \( b \)-beautiful number is less than or equal to 10. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it is a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express a two-digit number in base \( b \). A two-digit number in base \( b \) can be written as \( ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) such that \( 1 \leq a < b \) and \( 0 \leq c < b \). The sum of the digits is \( a + c \), and we need this sum to be equal to \( \sqrt{ab + c} \). Therefore, we have the equation:
\[
a + c = \sqrt{ab + c}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(a + c)^2 = ab + c
\]
Expanding the left side, we have:
\[
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0
\]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[
c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( c = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \), where \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2a - 1 \), and \( C = a^2 - ab \). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
c = \frac{-(2a - 1) \pm \sqrt{(2a - 1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (a^2 - ab)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-(2a - 1) \pm \sqrt{4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab}}{2} = \frac{-(2a - 1) \pm \sqrt{4ab - 4a + 1}}{2}

"To determine how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular 12-sided polygon (dodecagon) such that each side of the rectangle is along a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to consider the properties of the dodecagon and the possible configurations of the rectangles.

First, let's label the vertices of the dodecagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \) in a clockwise manner. A rectangle inside the dodecagon must have its sides parallel to the sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. This means that the vertices of the rectangle must be chosen such that they form a quadrilateral with sides parallel to the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

We can break this problem down by considering the possible lengths of the sides of the rectangle. The side lengths of the rectangle can be any combination of the distances between the vertices of the dodecagon, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 vertices apart (since the dodecagon is symmetric, the distance 6 vertices apart is a diameter, and the distance 7 vertices apart is the same as 5 vertices apart, and so on).

However, a key insight is that the number of such rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 pairs of parallel sides from the dodecagon. This is because each pair of parallel sides uniquely determines a rectangle.

The dodecagon has 12 sides, and we can choose 2 pairs of parallel sides in the following way:
- There are 6 pairs of parallel sides (since each side is parallel to the side directly opposite it).

The number of ways to choose 2 pairs of parallel sides from these 6 pairs is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{2} \):
\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of rectangles that can be formed inside the dodecagon is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",315,"[315, '315']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions and then calculate the sum of their squares. Let's break down the conditions step by step:

1. **The sum of the integers is 30.**
2. **The mode of the list is 9.** This means that 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list.
3. **The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.**

Let's start by considering the mode and median conditions. Since the mode is 9, the number 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's assume that 9 appears \( k \) times. The median is the middle number in the list when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

Let's try to construct a list that satisfies all these conditions. We will start with a list of 7 elements (since 7 is an odd number, the median will be a single element).

If 9 appears 3 times, the list could be something like \( [9, 9, 9, a, b, c, d] \) where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are positive integers different from 9. The median of this list is \( b \), and it must be a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Therefore, \( b \neq 9 \).

The sum of the elements is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 9 + a + b + c + d = 27 + a + b + c + d = 30 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ a + b + c + d = 3 \]

Since \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are positive integers and \( b \neq 9 \), the only possible values for \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are 1, 1, 1, and 0, but 0 is not a positive integer. Therefore, we need to consider a different approach.

Let's try a list of 8 elements (since 8 is an even number, the median will be the average of the two middle elements).

If 9 appears 4 times, the list could be something like \( [9, 9, 9, 9, a, b, c, d] \) where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are positive integers different from 9. The median of this list is the average of the 4th and 5th elements, which must be a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Therefore, the average of the 4th and 5th elements must be a positive integer that is not 9.

The sum of the elements is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + a + b + c + d = 36 + a + b + c + d = 30 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ a + b + c + d = -6 \]

Since \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are positive integers, this is not possible. Therefore, we need to consider a different approach.

Let's try a list of 6 elements (since 6 is an even number, the median will be the average of the two middle elements).

If 9 appears 3 times, the list could be something like \( [9, 9, 9, a, b, c] \) where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are positive integers different from 9. The median of this list is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements, which must be a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Therefore, the average of the 3rd and 4th elements must be a positive integer that is not 9.

The sum of the elements is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 9 + a + b + c = 27 + a + b + c = 30 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ a + b + c = 3 \]

Since \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are positive integers and \( b \neq 9 \), the only possible values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are 1, 1, and 1. Therefore, the list is \( [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1] \).

The median of this list is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements, which is:
\[ \frac{9 + 1}{2} = 5 \]
The median 5 does not appear in the list.

Now, we calculate the sum of the squares of the elements:
\[ 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 246 \]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the elements is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to fill a \(2 \times 3\) grid with digits such that the sum of the digits in each column (from left to right) is 999 for the two-digit numbers and 99 for the three-digit numbers.

First, let's denote the digits in the grid as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
where \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) are digits from 0 to 9.

The conditions given are:
1. The sum of the digits in each column (from left to right) is 999 for the two-digit numbers and 99 for the three-digit numbers. This means:
   - \(10a + d = 999\)
   - \(10b + e = 999\)
   - \(10c + f = 999\)
   - \(a + d = 99\)
   - \(b + e = 99\)
   - \(c + f = 99\)

From the equations \(10a + d = 999\) and \(a + d = 99\), we can solve for \(a\) and \(d\):
\[
10a + d = 999 \implies d = 999 - 10a
\]
\[
a + d = 99 \implies a + (999 - 10a) = 99 \implies 999 - 9a = 99 \implies 900 = 9a \implies a = 100
\]
Since \(a\) is a digit (0-9), there is no valid solution for \(a\). Therefore, it is impossible to fill the grid such that the sum of the digits in each column (from left to right) is 999 for the two-digit numbers and 99 for the three-digit numbers.

Thus, the number of ways to fill the grid is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",45,"[45, '45']",False
"To solve the given system of equations, we start with the equations:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(xyz)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding these three equations together, we get:

\[
(\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z)) + (\log_2(y) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(z)) + (\log_2(z) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
-\log_2(x) - \log_2(y) - \log_2(z) = -\log_2(xyz)
\]

So, we have:

\[
-\log_2(xyz) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus:

\[
\log_2(xyz) = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\log_2(x) + \log_2(y) + \log_2(z) = -\frac{13}{12}\) into the expression for \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

We can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(xyz)\) and the given equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in the expression for \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\) is 9, and the sum of the coefficients in the original equations is 6. Therefore, we can use the fact that:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) = 4 \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{13}{12} = \frac{52}{12} = \frac{13}{3}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{13}{3}\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:

\[
m + n = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find the length of the sides of the regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) where the sums of the opposite sides are equal and the areas of the triangles formed by the sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) are given as 200, 240, and 300 respectively, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the properties of the hexagon:**
   Since the hexagon is regular and the sums of the opposite sides are equal, we can denote the side lengths as follows:
   \[
   AB = a, \quad BC = b, \quad CD = c, \quad DE = d, \quad EF = e, \quad FA = f
   \]
   Given that the sums of the opposite sides are equal, we have:
   \[
   a + d = b + e = c + f
   \]

2. **Relate the areas of the triangles to the side lengths:**
   The area of a triangle formed by two sides of a regular hexagon and the line segment connecting their endpoints can be expressed in terms of the side lengths of the hexagon. For a regular hexagon, the area of the triangle formed by sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides and the circumradius of the hexagon.

3. **Use the given areas to find the side lengths:**
   The areas of the triangles are given as 200, 240, and 300. These areas can be used to set up equations involving the side lengths. However, since the hexagon is regular, the side lengths are equal, and the areas of the triangles formed by the sides are proportional to the squares of the side lengths.

4. **Calculate the side length of the hexagon:**
   Since the hexagon is regular, all sides are equal. Let the side length be \(s\). The area of the triangle formed by sides \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(EF\) can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
   \]
   Given the areas 200, 240, and 300, we can set up the following equations:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 200, \quad \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 240, \quad \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 300

   Solving these equations, we get:
   \[
   s^2 = \frac{800}{\sqrt{3}}, \quad s^2 = \frac{960}{\sqrt{3}}, \quad s^2 = \frac{1200}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]
   Since the side length \(s\) must be the same for all sides, we take the average of the side lengths:
   \[
   s = \sqrt{\frac{800 + 960 + 1200}{3\sqrt{3}}} = \sqrt{\frac{3960}{3\sqrt{3}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1320}{\sqrt{3}}} = \sqrt{440\sqrt{3}}

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the set \( A \) chosen by Alice and the set \( B \) chosen by Bob. Bob's set \( B \) consists of all non-empty subsets of \( A \) such that the maximum element of each subset is also an element of \( A \). The number of such subsets is given as 2024.

First, let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). The maximum element of any subset in \( B \) must be one of the elements of \( A \). For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the subsets in \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as the maximum element are all subsets of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}, a_i\} \) that include \( a_i \). The number of such subsets is \( 2^{i-1} \) because we can either include or exclude each of the elements \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1} \).

Therefore, the total number of subsets in \( B \) is the sum of the number of subsets for each maximum element:
\[
2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1
\]
We are given that the number of subsets in \( B \) is 2024, so we have:
\[
2^n - 1 = 2024
\]
Adding 1 to both sides, we get:
\[
2^n = 2025
\]
The value of \( n \) that satisfies this equation is \( n = 11 \) because \( 2^{11} = 2048 \) and \( 2^{10} = 1024 \). Therefore, \( n = 11 \).

Now, we need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \). Since \( A \) has 11 elements, we can denote them as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11} \). The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{11}
\]
However, we do not have the specific values of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11} \). But we know that the sum of the elements of \( A \) is the sum of the first 11 positive integers, which is:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 11 = \frac{11(11+1)}{2} = 66
\]

Therefore, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest positive integer \( N \) such that when any digit of \( N \) is replaced by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Additionally, we need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000, and then compute \( Q + R \).

First, let's consider the properties of \( N \). If we replace any digit of \( N \) by 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. This implies that the difference between \( N \) and the number obtained by replacing any digit by 1 must be divisible by 7.

Let's denote \( N \) as a \( k \)-digit number:
\[ N = a_k \cdot 10^{k-1} + a_{k-1} \cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + a_1 \cdot 10 + a_0 \]
where \( a_i \) are the digits of \( N \).

If we replace the digit \( a_i \) by 1, the resulting number is:
\[ M_i = a_k \cdot 10^{k-1} + a_{k-1} \cdot 10^{k-2} + \cdots + 1 \cdot 10^{k-i-1} + \cdots + a_1 \cdot 10 + a_0 \]

The difference between \( N \) and \( M_i \) is:
\[ N - M_i = (a_i - 1) \cdot 10^{k-i-1} \]

For \( M_i \) to be divisible by 7, \( N - M_i \) must be divisible by 7. Therefore, \( (a_i - 1) \cdot 10^{k-i-1} \) must be divisible by 7. Since 10 is not divisible by 7, \( a_i - 1 \) must be divisible by 7. The only possible value for \( a_i \) is 8 (because \( a_i \) is a digit from 0 to 9).

Thus, \( N \) must be a number consisting entirely of the digit 8. The largest such number is the largest 9-digit number, which is:
\[ N = 888888888 \]

Next, we need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000:
\[ N = 888888888 \]
\[ 888888888 \div 1000 = 888888 \text{ remainder } 888 \]

So, \( Q = 888888 \) and \( R = 888 \). Therefore, \( Q + R \) is:
\[ Q + R = 888888 + 888 = 889776 \]

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of ways to place chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains at most one chip, all chips are of the same color, and no two chips are in the same row or column. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 5 chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one chip, and all chips are of the same color.

This is a classic problem of finding the number of permutations of 5 elements, where each permutation corresponds to a unique way to place the chips. The number of permutations of 5 elements is given by \(5!\) (5 factorial).

Let's calculate \(5!\):

\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",902,"[902, '902']",False
