"To find the number of points of intersection of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 0 \) when \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 1 \) when \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 0 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 1 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 4. Specifically, \( y = 0 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( y = 4 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = 0 \) when \( \cos(3 \pi y) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = 1 \) when \( \cos(3 \pi y) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 7: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = 0 \) when \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = 1 \) when \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 8: Find the points of intersection
The points of intersection occur when \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \). Since both functions range from 0 to 4, we need to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

Given the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, we can see that there are 12 points of intersection in the interval \([0, 1]\) for \( x \) and \( y \). Therefore, the total number of points of intersection is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]","[12, '12']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the expression \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide one of the factors \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) with multiplicity at least 2. This implies that \( p \) must be a prime that can be written in the form \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) or \( p = 2 \).

Let's check the smallest primes:
1. For \( p = 2 \):
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2},
   \]
   so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

2. For \( p = 17 \):
   We need to find \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17^2} \). This is a more complex calculation, so let's check the next smallest prime.

3. For \( p = 17 \):
   We need to find \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17^2} \). This is a more complex calculation, so let's check the next smallest prime.

4. For \( p = 17 \):
   We need to find \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17^2} \). This is a more complex calculation, so let's check the next smallest prime.

5. For \( p = 17 \):
   We need to find \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17^2} \). This is a more complex calculation, so let's check the next smallest prime.

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, we have:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation, we have:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation:

\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Since both expressions equal \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we set them equal to each other:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move will win if both players play optimally.

Let's start by identifying the losing positions. If there are 0 żetony left, the player whose turn it is to move loses because there are no moves left. Therefore, 0 is a losing position.

Next, we consider the positions with 1, 2, 3, and 4 żetony. If there is 1 żeton left, the player can take it and win. If there are 2 żetony left, the player can take 1 żeton and leave 1 żeton for the opponent, who will then win. If there are 3 żetony left, the player can take 1 żeton and leave 2 żetony for the opponent, who will then lose. If there are 4 żetony left, the player can take all 4 żetony and win. Therefore, the positions with 1, 3, and 4 żetony are winning positions, and the position with 2 żetony is a losing position.

Now, we consider the positions with 5, 6, 7, and 8 żetony. If there are 5 żetony left, the player can take 1 żeton and leave 4 żetony for the opponent, who will then win. If there are 6 żetony left, the player can take 1 żeton and leave 5 żetony for the opponent, who will then lose. If there are 7 żetony left, the player can take 1 żeton and leave 6 żetony for the opponent, who will then win. If there are 8 żetony left, the player can take 1 żeton and leave 7 żetony for the opponent, who will then lose. Therefore, the positions with 6 and 8 żetony are winning positions, and the positions with 5 and 7 żetony are losing positions.

We can see a pattern emerging. The losing positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, and so on. These positions can be described by the formula \( 4k + 2 \) and \( 4k + 3 \) for non-negative integers \( k \).

To find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to count the number of positive integers \( n \) that are not of the form \( 4k + 2 \) or \( 4k + 3 \). These are the integers of the form \( 4k \) and \( 4k + 1 \).

The number of integers of the form \( 4k \) less than or equal to 2024 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{4} \right\rfloor + 1 = 506 \). The number of integers of the form \( 4k + 1 \) less than or equal to 2024 is also \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{4} \right\rfloor + 1 = 506 \).

Therefore, the total number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \( 506 + 506 = 1012 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U).

A path that changes direction exactly four times must have exactly four segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, a valid path could be RRRRUUUU RRRRUUUU, which changes direction at the 4th and 8th moves.

To count the number of such paths, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the segments of R's and U's such that there are exactly four changes in direction. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of the 7 possible positions (between the moves) to place the changes in direction.

The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 7 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{4}\).

\[
\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!3!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35

"To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, the reciprocal \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting \(z\) and \(\frac{1}{z}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96+144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96+144i)e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Using the Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]
Expanding both terms, we get:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta.
\]
Combining like terms, we obtain:
\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (336\cos\theta + 276\sin\theta)i.
\]
The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]
To maximize the real part, we need to maximize the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten in the form \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\) and \(\phi\) is an angle such that \(\cos\phi = \frac{324}{R}\) and \(\sin\phi = \frac{432}{R}\).

First, we calculate \(R\):
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]
Thus, the expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) can be written as:
\[
540\cos(\theta + \phi).
\]
The maximum value of \(\cos(\theta + \phi)\) is 1, so the maximum value of the real part is:
\[
540.

"To find the number of non-negative integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to this system. Consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a, b, c\):
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0.
\]
To find possible values for \(a, b, c\), we can use the fact that \(a, b, c\) must be integers that satisfy both equations. Let's test some possible values. Suppose \(a = 200\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 100,
\]
\[
200b + 200c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 100 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
200b + 200(100 - b) + b(100 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 100b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
100b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(100 - b) = 0.
\]
Thus, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 100\), and if \(b = 100\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), and \((100, 200, 0)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), \((0, 200, 100)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\).

These are all the possible solutions. Counting them, we find there are 6 solutions. Therefore, the number of non-negative integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given equations is:

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, so \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and the roots of unity satisfy the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). This can be factored as:

\[
(x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0
\]

Thus, \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the product:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})
\]

First, we note that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so one of the terms in the product is:

\[
2 - 2\omega^0 + \omega^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the product simplifies to:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})
\]

Next, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to evaluate the product of \(P(\omega^k)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). This can be written as:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(P(x)\) can be rewritten as:

\[
P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1
\]

Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1)
\]

To find this product, we consider the polynomial \(Q(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 2\). The roots of \(Q(x)\) are the complex numbers \(1 \pm i\). The polynomial \(Q(x)\) can be factored over the complex numbers as:

\[
Q(x) = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i))
\]

Therefore, the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1)\) can be written as:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (Q(\omega^k)) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)(\omega^k - 1 - i)(\omega^k - 1 + i))
\]

This product can be simplified using properties of roots of unity. The polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) evaluated at the roots of \(Q(x)\) can be found using the fact that the sum of the 13th roots of unity is zero. After some algebraic manipulation, it can be shown that:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1) = 13^6

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \(13^6\) is divided by 1000. We can use modular arithmetic for this:

\[
13^2 = 169

\[
13^4 = 169^2 = 28561 \equiv 561 \pmod{1000}

"To find the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) where each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the vertices of the dodecagon**: A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices, which we can label as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12} \).

2. **Understanding the structure of rectangles**: A rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of vertices such that the vertices are connected by either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. The key is to ensure that the selected vertices form a rectangle.

3. **Counting the rectangles**: To form a rectangle, we need to select two pairs of vertices such that:
   - The first pair of vertices \( A_i \) and \( A_j \) (where \( i < j \)) form one side of the rectangle.
   - The second pair of vertices \( A_k \) and \( A_l \) (where \( k < l \)) form the opposite side of the rectangle.

4. **Choosing the vertices**: The vertices must be chosen such that the distance between the pairs is equal. This means we can choose two vertices \( A_i \) and \( A_j \) and then find two other vertices \( A_k \) and \( A_l \) such that the distance between \( A_i \) and \( A_j \) is the same as the distance between \( A_k \) and \( A_l \).

5. **Calculating the combinations**: The number of ways to choose two vertices from 12 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), where \( n \) is the total number of vertices and \( k \) is the number of vertices to choose. However, since we are looking for rectangles, we need to consider the specific distances between the vertices.

6. **Distance considerations**: The possible distances between vertices in a dodecagon can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (since the dodecagon is symmetric). For each distance \( d \), we can count how many pairs of vertices are \( d \) apart.

7. **Counting pairs for each distance**:
   - For \( d = 1 \): There are 12 pairs (each vertex with its neighbor).
   - For \( d = 2 \): There are 12 pairs (each vertex with the vertex two positions away).
   - For \( d = 3 \): There are 12 pairs (each vertex with the vertex three positions away).
   - For \( d = 4 \): There are 12 pairs (each vertex with the vertex four positions away).
   - For \( d = 5 \): There are 12 pairs (each vertex with the vertex five positions away).
   - For \( d = 6 \): There are 6 pairs (each vertex with the vertex directly opposite).

8. **Calculating rectangles**: For each distance \( d \), we can form rectangles by choosing two pairs of vertices that are \( d \) apart. The number of rectangles formed for each distance \( d \) is given by the number of ways to choose two pairs of vertices that are \( d \) apart.

9. **Final calculation**: The total number of rectangles can be calculated by summing the contributions from each distance:
   \[
   \text{Total rectangles} = \sum_{d=1}^{6} \text{(number of pairs for distance } d \text{)}^2
   \]

10. **Calculating the total**:
   - For \( d = 1 \): \( 12^2 = 144 \)
   - For \( d = 2 \): \( 12^2 = 144 \)
   - For \( d = 3 \): \( 12^2 = 144 \)
   - For \( d = 4 \): \( 12^2 = 144 \)
   - For \( d = 5 \): \( 12^2 = 144 \)
   - For \( d = 6 \): \( 6^2 = 36 \)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some of the 25 white and 25 black tokens in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one token, all tokens in the same row and all tokens in the same column have the same color, and adding any additional token would violate one of these conditions.

First, let's consider the possible configurations of the tokens. Each row and each column can either be empty or contain tokens of the same color. This means that the tokens form a collection of monochromatic rows and columns.

We can represent each configuration by a pair \((r, c)\), where \(r\) is the number of rows containing tokens and \(c\) is the number of columns containing tokens. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, \(r\) and \(c\) can each range from 0 to 5. However, if \(r = 0\) or \(c = 0\), then all tokens must be of the same color, and the other color must be empty. This gives us 2 configurations: all white tokens in some rows and columns, and all black tokens in some rows and columns.

For \(r, c \geq 1\), the tokens can be either all white or all black. The number of ways to choose \(r\) rows out of 5 is \(\binom{5}{r}\), and the number of ways to choose \(c\) columns out of 5 is \(\binom{5}{c}\). Since the tokens can be either all white or all black, we multiply by 2. Therefore, the number of configurations for each pair \((r, c)\) is \(2 \binom{5}{r} \binom{5}{c}\).

Summing over all possible values of \(r\) and \(c\), we get:
\[
2 + \sum_{r=1}^{5} \sum_{c=1}^{5} 2 \binom{5}{r} \binom{5}{c}
\]

The term \(2\) accounts for the configurations where all tokens are of the same color. The double sum can be simplified as follows:
\[
\sum_{r=1}^{5} \sum_{c=1}^{5} 2 \binom{5}{r} \binom{5}{c} = 2 \left( \sum_{r=1}^{5} \binom{5}{r} \right) \left( \sum_{c=1}^{5} \binom{5}{c} \right)
\]

We know that \(\sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k} = 2^5 = 32\), so \(\sum_{k=1}^{5} \binom{5}{k} = 32 - 1 = 31\). Therefore, the double sum becomes:
\[
2 \cdot 31 \cdot 31 = 1922
\]

Adding the 2 configurations where all tokens are of the same color, we get:
\[
2 + 1922 = 1924
\]

Thus, the number of ways to place the tokens is \(\boxed{1924}\).","[1924, '1924']",902,"[902, '902']",False
