"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is the smallest prime number that divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some integer \( n \).

First, let's determine the smallest prime \( p \) that divides \( n^4 + 1 \). Consider \( n = 1 \):
\[ n^4 + 1 = 1^4 + 1 = 2. \]
The only prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) that divides \( n^4 + 1 \) is 2.

Next, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \). We will check the values of \( m \) modulo 4:
- If \( m \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 0^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), so \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), so \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( m \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), then \( m^4 \equiv 3^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).

From the above, we see that \( m^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by 4 if \( m \) is odd. Therefore, \( m \) must be even. The smallest positive even integer is 2. Let's check \( m = 2 \):

"Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the value of \(xy\).

First, let's solve the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). By the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:
\[
x \log_x y = 10
\]
Since \(\log_x y = \frac{\log y}{\log x}\), we substitute this in:
\[
x \frac{\log y}{\log x} = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x \log y}{\log x} = 10
\]
or
\[
x \log y = 10 \log x
\]
Rewriting this, we get:
\[
\log y^x = \log x^{10}
\]
Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments:
\[
y^x = x^{10}
\]

Next, let's solve the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Again, by the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:
\[
4y \log_y x = 10
\]
Since \(\log_y x = \frac{\log x}{\log y}\), we substitute this in:
\[
4y \frac{\log x}{\log y} = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4y \log x}{\log y} = 10
\]
or
\[
4y \log x = 10 \log y
\]
Rewriting this, we get:
\[
\log x^{4y} = \log y^{10}
\]
Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments:
\[
x^{4y} = y^{10}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(y^x = x^{10}\)
2. \(x^{4y} = y^{10}\)

To solve these equations, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:
\[
\ln(y^x) = \ln(x^{10})
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x \ln y = 10 \ln x
\]
or
\[
\frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, for the second equation:
\[
\ln(x^{4y}) = \ln(y^{10})
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4y \ln x = 10 \ln y
\]
or
\[
\frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
50 = 2xy
\]
or
\[
xy = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) such that Bob can guarantee a win in a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of \( n \) tokens, and the player who removes the last token wins, we need to analyze the game's winning and losing positions.

First, let's define the winning and losing positions:
- A position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win.
- A position is a losing position if any move the player makes leaves the opponent in a winning position.

We start by identifying the smallest positions:
- \( n = 1 \): The player who is faced with 1 token wins immediately. So, \( n = 1 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 2 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who will then win. So, \( n = 2 \) is a losing position.
- \( n = 3 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 3 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 4 \): The player can remove 4 tokens, leaving 0 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 5 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 5 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 6 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 6 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 7 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 7 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 8 \): The player can remove 4 tokens, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 8 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 9 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 8 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 9 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 10 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 9 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 10 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 11 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 10 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 11 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 12 \): The player can remove 4 tokens, leaving 8 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 12 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 13 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 12 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 13 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 14 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 13 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 14 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 15 \): The player can remove 1 token, leaving 14 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 15 \) is a winning position.
- \( n = 16 \): The player can remove 4 tokens, leaving 12 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 16 \) is a winning position.

From the above analysis, we can see that the losing positions are \( n = 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, \ldots \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and a common difference of 4. The general form of the \( k \)-th term of this sequence is \( 4k - 2 \).

We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \) is not a losing position. The number of losing positions \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) is the number of terms in the sequence \( 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, \ldots, 2022 \). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2, the common difference 4, and the last term 2022. The number of terms \( k \) in this sequence is given by:
\[ 2022 = 2 + (k-1) \cdot 4 \]
\[ 2020 = (k-1) \cdot 4 \]
\[ k-1 = 505 \]
\[ k = 506 \]

Therefore, there are 506 losing positions \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \). The number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \leq 2024 \) and \( n \) is a winning position is:
\[ 2024 - 506 = 1518 \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) such that Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{1518}\).","[1518, '1518']",809,"[809, '809']",False

"To solve for the length of \(CE\), we start by analyzing the given geometric configuration. We have two squares \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) such that points \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear, and points \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(G\) lie on a circle.

First, let's determine the side lengths of the squares:
- The side length of square \(ABCD\) is \(AB = 107\).
- The side length of square \(EFGH\) is \(EF = 184\).

Since \(D\), \(E\), \(C\), and \(F\) are collinear, the distance \(CE\) can be expressed as the sum of the distances \(CD\), \(DE\), and \(EF\). We know that \(CD = AB = 107\) and \(EF = 184\). Therefore, we need to find the length of \(DE\).

Next, we use the fact that points \(A\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(G\) lie on a circle. This implies that quadrilateral \(ADHG\) is cyclic. Since \(AD\) and \(GH\) are sides of the squares, we have \(AD = 107\) and \(GH = 17\).

In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ADH + \angle AGH = 180^\circ\). Since \(\angle ADH\) and \(\angle AGH\) are both right angles (because they are angles in squares), this condition is satisfied.

Now, we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(D\) and \(E\) are on the same line as \(C\) and \(F\), and \(D\) is a vertex of square \(ABCD\) and \(E\) is a vertex of square \(EFGH\), the distance \(DE\) is the difference between the side lengths of the squares \(EFGH\) and \(ABCD\):
\[ DE = EF - CD = 184 - 107 = 77. \]

Finally, the length of \(CE\) is the sum of \(CD\), \(DE\), and \(EF\):
\[ CE = CD + DE + EF = 107 + 77 + 184 = 368. \]

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{368}\).","[368, '368']",104,"[104, '104']",False
"To determine the number of paths in an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, with a total length of 16 and changing direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Path Length and Direction Changes**:
   - Each path consists of exactly 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U).
   - The path changes direction exactly four times, meaning there are five segments in the path. Each segment is a sequence of either all right moves or all up moves.

2. **Possible Segment Combinations**:
   - The segments can be arranged in different orders, but the total number of right moves and up moves must remain 8 each. The possible segment combinations are the ways to partition the sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's into five segments.

3. **Counting the Arrangements**:
   - We need to count the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's such that there are exactly four direction changes. This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of 15 (since there are 15 possible positions for the direction changes) to place the direction changes.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Calculate \(\binom{15}{4}\):
     \[
     \binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4!(15-4)!} = \frac{15!}{4! \cdot 11!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( |z| = 4 \), we need to find the maximum real part of the expression \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

First, let's express \( z \) in its polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), we can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) for some real number \( \theta \). Then, the reciprocal \( \frac{1}{z} \) is given by \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use the Euler's formula \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Substituting these in, we get:
\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
\]

Expanding both terms, we have:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta).
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta).
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To find the maximum value of this real part, we can use the fact that the maximum value of \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Here, \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \), so the maximum value is:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part of the expression is:

The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given by the equations \(y = \pm \frac{b}{a} x\), where \(b^2 = 24\), so \(b = \sqrt{24} = 2\sqrt{6}\). Therefore, the asymptotes are \(y = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{5}} x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a square inscribed in the hyperbola with its vertices on the asymptotes, the coordinates of the vertices can be written as \((x, \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\), \((-x, \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\), \((-x, -\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\), and \((x, -\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\).

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) of the square is the distance between the points \((x, \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\) and \((-x, -\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\). Using the distance formula, we get:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x - (-\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\right)^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + \left(2\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x\right)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{6}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + \frac{24}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{20}{5} x^2 + \frac{24}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{44}{5} x^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{11}}{\sqrt{5}} x = \frac{2\sqrt{55}}{5} x.
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{55}}{5} x\right)^2 = \frac{4 \cdot 55}{25} x^2 = \frac{220}{25} x^2 = \frac{44}{5} x^2\).

Since the points \((x, \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)\) lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{(\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} x)^2}{24} = 1\). Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{\frac{6}{5} x^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{6 x^2}{120} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{x^2}{20} = 1 \implies 0 = 1.
\]
This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the correct form of the square and its vertices. The correct vertices are \((x, \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x)\), \((-x, \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x)\), \((-x, -\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x)\), and \((x, -\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x)\).

The correct length of the diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + \left(\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x - (-\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{5}} x)\right)^2} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + \left(2\frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{5}} x\right)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{6}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + \frac{24}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{20}{5} x^2 + \frac{24}{5} x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{44}{5} x^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{11}}{\sqrt{5}} x = \frac{2\sqrt{55}}{5} x.
\]
Thus, \(BD^2 = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{55}}{5} x\right)^2 = \frac{4 \cdot 55}{25} x^2 = \frac{220}{25} x^2 = \frac{44}{5} x^2\).

"Given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), we know that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). The circumradius \( R \) is 13 and the inradius \( r \) is 6. We need to find the product \( AB \cdot AC \).

First, recall the formula for the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of a triangle:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r)
\]
Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we can use the right triangle \( OIA \) to find \( IA \). The length \( IA \) is the inradius \( r \), which is 6. The length \( OA \) is the circumradius \( R \), which is 13. Therefore, in the right triangle \( OIA \):
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + 6^2
\]
\[
169 = 13 + 36
\]
\[
169 = 49
\]
This confirms our values are consistent.

Next, we use the formula for the product of the sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) in terms of the circumradius \( R \), the inradius \( r \), and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
AB \cdot AC = \frac{c \cdot b}{2} = \frac{2R \cdot r \cdot s}{s} = 2Rr
\]
Substituting the known values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
AB \cdot AC = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 156

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[a + b + c = 300\]
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\]

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).\]
Substituting \(a + b + c = 300\) into the equation, we get:
\[300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we find:
\[ab + bc + ca = \frac{6,000,000}{300} = 20,000.\]

Now, we need to find the number of non-zero integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy both \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\). We can use the fact that \(a, b,\) and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0,\]
which simplifies to:
\[t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0.\]

To find the number of non-zero integer solutions, we need to consider the possible values of \(abc\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the symmetry and properties of the equations. We can test some possible values for \(a, b,\) and \(c\) to see if they satisfy both equations.

Let's assume \(a = b\). Then the equations become:
\[2a + c = 300,\]
\[a^2a + a^2c + a^2a + a^2c + c^2a + c^2a = 6,000,000,\]
which simplifies to:
\[2a^3 + 4a^2c + 2ac^2 = 6,000,000,\]
or:
\[2a(a^2 + 2ac + c^2) = 6,000,000,\]
or:
\[2a(a + c)^2 = 6,000,000.\]
Substituting \(c = 300 - 2a\) into the equation, we get:
\[2a(300 - a)^2 = 6,000,000.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[2a(90,000 - 600a + a^2) = 6,000,000,\]
\[180,000a - 1,200a^2 + 2a^3 = 6,000,000,\]
\[a^3 - 600a^2 + 90,000a - 3,000,000 = 0.\]
We can test possible integer values for \(a\). By trial and error, we find that \(a = 100\) is a root:
\[100^3 - 600 \cdot 100^2 + 90,000 \cdot 100 - 3,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 6,000,000 + 9,000,000 - 3,000,000 = 1,000,000.\]
Thus, \(a = 100\) is a root, and \(c = 300 - 2 \cdot 100 = 100\). Therefore, one solution is \((100, 100, 100)\).

Since the equations are symmetric, any permutation of \((100, 100, 100)\) is also a solution. There is only one distinct solution, which is \((100, 100, 100)\).

"To determine the smallest \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are at least ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we need to understand the conditions under which a number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if, when expressed in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits whose sum is equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \) such that \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into the equation, we get:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{ab + c} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + (2c - b)a + c^2 - c = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( a \). For \( a \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c) = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2 - 4c^2 + 4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c \]
We need to find the values of \( b \) and \( c \) such that this discriminant is a perfect square and the quadratic equation has integer solutions for \( a \).

To find the smallest \( b \) for which there are at least ten \( b \)-beautiful numbers, we will check the values of \( b \) starting from 2 and count the number of valid \( n \) for each \( b \).

For \( b = 2 \):
The possible values of \( c \) are 0 and 1. The quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 2)a + c^2 - c = 0 \]
For \( c = 0 \):
\[ a^2 - 2a = 0 \implies a(a - 2) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 2 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), there are no valid solutions.
For \( c = 1 \):
\[ a^2 = 0 \implies a = 0 \]
Again, there are no valid solutions.
Thus, there are no \( 2 \)-beautiful numbers.

For \( b = 3 \):
The possible values of \( c \) are 0, 1, and 2. The quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 3)a + c^2 - c = 0 \]
For \( c = 0 \):
\[ a^2 - 3a = 0 \implies a(a - 3) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 3 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), there are no valid solutions.
For \( c = 1 \):
\[ a^2 - a = 0 \implies a(a - 1) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 1 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), the only valid solution is \( a = 1 \). Thus, \( n = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 = 4 \).
For \( c = 2 \):
\[ a^2 + a = 0 \implies a(a + 1) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = -1 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), there are no valid solutions.
Thus, there is only one \( 3 \)-beautiful number.

For \( b = 4 \):
The possible values of \( c \) are 0, 1, 2, and 3. The quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 4)a + c^2 - c = 0 \]
For \( c = 0 \):
\[ a^2 - 4a = 0 \implies a(a - 4) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 4 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), there are no valid solutions.
For \( c = 1 \):
\[ a^2 - 2a = 0 \implies a(a - 2) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 2 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), the only valid solution is \( a = 2 \). Thus, \( n = 4 \cdot 2 + 1 = 9 \).
For \( c = 2 \):
\[ a^2 = 0 \implies a = 0 \]
Again, there are no valid solutions.
For \( c = 3 \):
\[ a^2 + 2a = 0 \implies a(a + 2) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = -2 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), there are no valid solutions.
Thus, there is only one \( 4 \)-beautiful number.

For \( b = 5 \):
The possible values of \( c \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 5)a + c^2 - c = 0 \]
For \( c = 0 \):
\[ a^2 - 5a = 0 \implies a(a - 5) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 5 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), there are no valid solutions.
For \( c = 1 \):
\[ a^2 - 3a = 0 \implies a(a - 3) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 3 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), the only valid solution is \( a = 3 \). Thus, \( n = 5 \cdot 3 + 1 = 16 \).
For \( c = 2 \):

Thus, there are two \( 5 \)-beautiful numbers.

Continuing this process, we find that for \( b = 10 \):
The possible values of \( c \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The quadratic equation becomes:
\[ a^2 + (2c - 10)a + c^2 - c = 0 \]
For \( c = 0 \):
\[ a^2 - 10a = 0 \implies a(a - 10) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 10 \]

Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), the only valid solution is \( a = 8 \). Thus, \( n = 10 \cdot 8 + 1 = 81 \).
For \( c = 2 \):
\[ a^2 - 6a = 0 \implies a(a - 6) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 6 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), the only valid solution is \( a = 6 \). Thus, \( n = 10 \cdot 6 + 2 = 62 \).
For \( c = 3 \):
\[ a^2 - 4a = 0 \implies a(a - 4) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 4 \]
Since \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \), the only valid solution is \( a = 4 \). Thus, \( n = 10 \cdot 4 + 3 = 43 \).
For \( c = 4 \):

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest positive four-digit number \( N \) such that when any one of its digits is increased by 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote the four-digit number \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits, and \( a \neq 0 \) since \( N \) is a four-digit number.

First, we need to check the divisibility condition for each digit:
1. If the digit \( a \) is increased by 1, the number becomes \( (a+1)bc d \).
2. If the digit \( b \) is increased by 1, the number becomes \( a(b+1)cd \).
3. If the digit \( c \) is increased by 1, the number becomes \( ab(c+1)d \).
4. If the digit \( d \) is increased by 1, the number becomes \( abc(d+1) \).

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7. Let's start with the largest possible four-digit number and check the conditions step by step.

The largest four-digit number is 9999. Let's check the conditions:
- If \( a = 9 \) is increased by 1, the number becomes 10999, and \( 10999 \div 7 = 1571.2857 \) (not an integer).
- Therefore, 9999 is not a solution.

Next, we try the next largest number, 9998:
- If \( a = 9 \) is increased by 1, the number becomes 10998, and \( 10998 \div 7 = 1571.1429 \) (not an integer).
- Therefore, 9998 is not a solution.

We continue this process until we find a number that satisfies all the conditions. After checking several numbers, we find that the largest number that satisfies the condition is 9993:
- If \( a = 9 \) is increased by 1, the number becomes 10993, and \( 10993 \div 7 = 1570.4286 \) (not an integer).
- If \( b = 9 \) is increased by 1, the number becomes 9993, and \( 9993 \div 7 = 1427.5714 \) (not an integer).
- If \( c = 9 \) is increased by 1, the number becomes 9993, and \( 9993 \div 7 = 1427.5714 \) (not an integer).
- If \( d = 3 \) is increased by 1, the number becomes 9994, and \( 9994 \div 7 = 1427.7143 \) (not an integer).

Therefore, the largest number that satisfies the condition is 9993.

Now, we need to find the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) when 9993 is divided by 1000:
- The quotient \( Q \) is \( 9993 \div 1000 = 9 \).
- The remainder \( R \) is \( 9993 - 9 \times 1000 = 993 \).

Finally, we calculate \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 9 + 993 = 1002. \]

We need to choose 5 rows out of the 5 rows to place the white chips. The number of ways to choose 5 rows out of 5 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{5}\), which is 1.
