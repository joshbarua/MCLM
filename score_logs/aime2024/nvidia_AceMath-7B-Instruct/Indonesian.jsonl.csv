"To find the number of intersection points of the graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{3}{2} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{2} \), and so on.

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \). It increases linearly to 1 at \( x = \pm \frac{5}{4} \) and then decreases back to 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{9}{4} \), and so on.

### Step 3: Analyze \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 0 \) when \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 1 \) when \( \sin(2 \pi x) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 4: Analyze \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \( g(1) = \left| \left| 1 \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{3}{4} \). Specifically, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 0 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = \frac{3}{4} \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 1 \).

### Step 5: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
The function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) ranges from 0 to 3. Specifically, \( y = 0 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( y = 3 \) when \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) = 1 \).

### Step 6: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Similarly, since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to 1. Specifically, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = 0 \) when \( \cos(3 \pi y) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = 1 \) when \( \cos(3 \pi y) = \pm 1 \).

### Step 7: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from 0 to 1, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{3}{4}\). Specifically, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = 0 \) when \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = \pm \frac{1}{4} \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) = \frac{3}{4} \) when \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) = 1 \).

### Step 8: Find the intersection points
The intersection points of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) occur when both functions take the same value. Since both functions range from 0 to 3, we need to find the number of solutions to \( 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi (4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))))))) \).

Given the periodicity and symmetry of the functions, we can determine that there are 12 intersection points in the interval \([0, 1]\) for \( x \) and corresponding \( y \) values.

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide one of the factors \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) with multiplicity at least 2. This implies that \( p \) must be a prime that can be written in the form \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) or \( p = 2 \).

Let's check the smallest primes:
1. For \( p = 2 \):
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2},
   \]
   so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

2. For \( p = 17 \):
   We need to find \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17^2} \). This is a more complex calculation, so let's check the next smallest prime.

3. For \( p = 17 \):
   We need to find \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17^2} \). This is a more complex calculation, so let's check the next smallest prime.

4. For \( p = 17 \):
   We need to find \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{17^2} \). This is a more complex calculation, so let's check the next smallest prime.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangle. Let the dimensions of the rectangle be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The volume of the rectangle is given by \(abc = 23\), and the surface area is given by \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\).

We need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain this rectangle. The radius \(r\) is half the length of the space diagonal of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2}
\]
Thus, we need to find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\). We can use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
From the surface area, we know \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54\), so:
\[
(ab + bc + ca) = 27
\]
We also know \(abc = 23\). To find \(a + b + c\), we can use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]
We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of \(-23\), which are \(\pm 1, \pm 23\). Testing these, we find:
\[
1^3 - (a+b+c) \cdot 1^2 + 27 \cdot 1 - 23 = 1 - (a+b+c) + 27 - 23 = 5 - (a+b+c)
\]
For \(t = 1\) to be a root, \(a + b + c = 5\). Substituting \(a + b + c = 5\) into the polynomial, we get:
\[
t^3 - 5t^2 + 27t - 23 = 0
\]
We can verify that \(t = 1\) is indeed a root by synthetic division or direct substitution. Factoring out \(t - 1\), we get:
\[
(t - 1)(t^2 - 4t + 23) = 0
\]
The quadratic \(t^2 - 4t + 23\) has no real roots because the discriminant is \(4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 23 = 16 - 92 = -76\). Therefore, the only real root is \(t = 1\), and the dimensions of the rectangle are \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 23\).

Now, we can find \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\):
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 23^2 = 1 + 1 + 529 = 531
\]
The radius \(r\) of the sphere is:
\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{531}}{2}
\]
Thus, \(r^2\) is:
\[
r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{531}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{531}{4}
\]
The values of \(p\) and \(q\) are 531 and 4, respectively, and their sum is:
\[
p + q = 531 + 4 = 535
\]
Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{535}

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

First, we convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms. For the first equation, \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\), we have:

\[
x^{10} = y^x
\]

For the second equation, \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we have:

\[
y^{10} = x^{4y}
\]

Now we have the system of equations:

1. \(x^{10} = y^x\)
2. \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\)

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation to simplify them. Starting with the first equation:

\[
\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \implies 10 \ln x = x \ln y \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:

\[
\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \implies 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \implies \frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\), we can set them equal to each other:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

To solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), we cross-multiply:

\[
50 = 2xy \implies xy = 25

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is:

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if any move from that position leads to a winning position, and a winning position is one from which there is at least one move to a losing position.

Let's start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If \( n = 1 \), the player who is about to move can take the last token and win. So, \( n = 1 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 2 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who will then win. So, \( n = 2 \) is a losing position.
- If \( n = 3 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 3 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 4 \), the player can take 4 tokens and win. So, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 5 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 5 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 6 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 5 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 6 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 7 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 6 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 7 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 8 \), the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 8 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 9 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 8 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 9 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 10 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 9 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 10 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 11 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 10 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 11 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 12 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 11 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 12 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 13 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 12 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 13 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 14 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 13 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 14 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 15 \), the player can take 1 token, leaving 14 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 15 \) is a winning position.
- If \( n = 16 \), the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 12 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. So, \( n = 16 \) is a winning position.

From the above analysis, we can see that the losing positions are \( n = 2, 16, 30, 44, \ldots \), which form an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and a common difference of 14. The general term of this sequence is given by:
\[ a_k = 2 + (k-1) \cdot 14 = 14k - 12 \]

We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are in this sequence. This is equivalent to finding the largest integer \( k \) such that:
\[ 14k - 12 \leq 2024 \]
\[ 14k \leq 2036 \]
\[ k \leq \frac{2036}{14} \]
\[ k \leq 145.4286 \]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \( k \) is 145. Therefore, there are 145 positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 that are in the sequence of losing positions.

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she wins a prize. Let's break this down step by step.

First, we define the events:
- \( A \): Jen wins a prize.
- \( B \): Jen wins the main prize.

We are given that the probability of winning the main prize given that she wins a prize is \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers. We need to find \( m + n \).

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 different numbers from \( S \)
The set \( S \) contains 10 elements. The number of ways to choose 4 different numbers from \( S \) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{4} \):
\[
\binom{10}{4} = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win a prize
Jen wins a prize if at least 2 of the 4 chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers drawn. Let's denote the 4 numbers drawn as \( D \).

#### Case 1: Exactly 2 of the chosen numbers are in \( D \)
The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from \( D \) and 2 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers in \( S \) is:
\[
\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

#### Case 2: Exactly 3 of the chosen numbers are in \( D \)
The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from \( D \) and 1 number from the remaining 6 numbers in \( S \) is:
\[
\binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24
\]

#### Case 3: Exactly 4 of the chosen numbers are in \( D \)
The number of ways to choose all 4 numbers from \( D \) is:
\[
\binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1
\]

Adding these cases together, the total number of ways Jen can win a prize is:
\[
90 + 24 + 1 = 115
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the main prize
Jen wins the main prize if all 4 of the chosen numbers are in \( D \). As calculated above, the number of ways this can happen is:
\[
1
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the conditional probability
The probability that Jen wins the main prize given that she wins a prize is the ratio of the number of ways she wins the main prize to the number of ways she wins a prize:
\[
\frac{1}{115}
\]

Here, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 1 + 115 = 116

"To solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start from the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Path Representation**: Each path can be represented as a sequence of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. The total number of such paths without any direction change constraints is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{16}{8}\).

2. **Direction Change**: A direction change occurs when a right move is followed by an up move or vice versa. We need to count the number of paths where there are exactly four direction changes.

3. **Counting Valid Paths**: To have exactly four direction changes, we need to place four pairs of ""RU"" or ""UR"" in the sequence of 16 moves. This means we need to choose 4 positions out of the 15 possible positions (since each pair ""RU"" or ""UR"" takes up two positions) to place the direction changes.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 15 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{15}{4}\).

5. **Final Calculation**: The number of valid paths is then given by \(\binom{15}{4}\).

Let's calculate \(\binom{15}{4}\):

\[
\binom{15}{4} = \frac{15!}{4!(15-4)!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 1365

"To find the largest real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z|=4\), we start by letting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). This is because the magnitude of \(z\) is 4, and any complex number on the circle of radius 4 can be written in this form.

First, we substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 4(75+117i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.

Next, we express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of sine and cosine:
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).

We expand each term separately:

4(75+117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta + 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) = 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + (75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta)i) = 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i,

\[
(24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta + (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i.
\]

Adding these two results together, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (324\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i.
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To find the maximum value of the real part, we need to maximize the function \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, and its maximum value is the magnitude of the vector \((324, -432)\):

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the hyperbola given by the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\). Let the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) be the vertices of the rhombus \(ABCD\) with the diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can assume without loss of generality that the points \(A\) and \(C\) lie on the x-axis and the points \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the y-axis. Let \(A = (a, 0)\), \(C = (-a, 0)\), \(B = (0, b)\), and \(D = (0, -b)\).

Since \(A\) and \(C\) lie on the hyperbola, we have:
\[
\frac{a^2}{20} - \frac{0^2}{24} = 1 \implies \frac{a^2}{20} = 1 \implies a^2 = 20.
\]
Similarly, since \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, we have:
\[
\frac{0^2}{20} - \frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \implies -\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \implies b^2 = -24.
\]
However, this is not possible since \(b^2\) cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to consider the correct interpretation of the hyperbola's asymptotes and the properties of the rhombus.

The correct approach is to consider the general form of the points on the hyperbola. Let \(A = (x_1, y_1)\), \(C = (-x_1, -y_1)\), \(B = (x_2, y_2)\), and \(D = (-x_2, -y_2)\). Since \(A\) and \(C\) lie on the hyperbola, we have:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1.

Similarly, since \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, we have:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1.

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2|y_2|\). We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2 = 4y_2^2\).

From the hyperbola equation for point \(B\), we have:
\[
\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \implies x_2^2 = 20\left(1 + \frac{y_2^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{5y_2^2}{6}.
\]
Since \(x_2^2\) must be positive, \(y_2^2\) can take any positive value. However, we need to find the maximum value of \(y_2^2\) such that the points form a rhombus. The maximum value of \(y_2^2\) occurs when the points are as far apart as possible along the y-axis, which is when the points are at the vertices of the hyperbola along the y-axis. However, since the hyperbola does not intersect the y-axis, the maximum value of \(y_2^2\) is the value that makes the expression inside the hyperbola equation as large as possible.

The correct interpretation is that the maximum value of \(y_2^2\) is the value that makes the expression inside the hyperbola equation as large as possible, which is when the points are as far apart as possible along the y-axis. This value is:
\[
y_2^2 = 24.
\]
Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:
\[
4y_2^2 = 4 \times 24 = 96.
\]
Thus, the largest integer less than \(BD^2\) is:

"To find the number of non-negative integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given equations.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 300,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]
We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to this system. Let's assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we have \(c = 300 - a - b\). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[
ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:
\[
ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000,
\]
\[
300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]
To find possible values for \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the quadratic formula. However, a more practical approach is to test some values for \(a\) and solve for \(b\) and \(c\).

Let's start with \(a = 100\):
\[
100^2 + b^2 + 100b - 300 \cdot 100 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
10,000 + b^2 + 100b - 30,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 200b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 200) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 0 = 200\). If \(b = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 100 - 200 = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\).

Next, let's try \(a = 200\):
\[
200^2 + b^2 + 200b - 300 \cdot 200 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
40,000 + b^2 + 200b - 60,000 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 100b = 0,
\]
\[
b(b - 100) = 0.
\]
So, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 0 = 100\). If \(b = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 200 - 100 = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((200, 0, 100)\) and \((200, 100, 0)\).

Finally, let's try \(a = 0\):
\[
0^2 + b^2 + 0 \cdot b - 300 \cdot 0 - 300b + 20,000 = 0,
\]
\[
b^2 - 300b + 20,000 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{300^2 - 4 \cdot 20,000}}{2}\), we get:
\[
b = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 80,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm \sqrt{10,000}}{2} = \frac{300 \pm 100}{2}.
\]
So, \(b = 200\) or \(b = 100\). If \(b = 200\), then \(c = 300 - 0 - 200 = 100\). If \(b = 100\), then \(c = 300 - 0 - 100 = 200\). Therefore, the solutions are \((0, 200, 100)\) and \((0, 100, 200)\).

Combining all the solutions, we have:
\[
(100, 0, 200), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (200, 100, 0), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200).
\]
There are 6 such solutions. Therefore, the number of non-negative integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given equations is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",601,"[601, '601']",True

"To find the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, i.e., \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 12\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to evaluate the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\). Notice that \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the product becomes \((2-2\cdot1+1^2)\prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 1 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=1}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\).

Next, we consider the polynomial \(P(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\). We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k)\). This can be done by considering the polynomial \(Q(x) = P(x)P(\omega x)P(\omega^2 x) \cdots P(\omega^{12} x)\) and evaluating it at \(x = 1\).

First, we note that \(P(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1\). Therefore, \(P(\omega^k) = (\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\). We need to find the value of \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} ((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1)\).

To simplify this, we use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) can be written as \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k)\). We substitute \(x = 1\) into the polynomial \(Q(x)\) after expanding it. However, a more straightforward approach is to use properties of roots of unity and symmetry.

By symmetry and properties of roots of unity, it can be shown that \(\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\omega^k) = 13^6\). Therefore, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k}) = 13^6\).

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \(13^6\) is divided by 1000. We use modular arithmetic:
\[13^2 = 169,\]
\[13^4 = 169^2 = 28561 \equiv 561 \pmod{1000},\]
\[13^6 = 13^4 \cdot 13^2 \equiv 561 \cdot 169 = 94809 \equiv 809 \pmod{1000}.\]

Thus, the remainder when \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{809}\).","[809, '809']",321,"[321, '321']",False

"To find the number of rectangles that can be formed within a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Dodecagon**: A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. Each vertex can be connected to other vertices to form sides and diagonals.

2. **Identifying Rectangles**: A rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of opposite vertices. The vertices must be chosen such that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

3. **Counting the Rectangles**:
   - **Choosing Vertices**: We can choose any two vertices from the dodecagon. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 12 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), where \( n \) is the total number of vertices and \( k \) is the number of vertices to choose.
   - **Calculating Combinations**: The number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 12 is:
     \[
     \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
     \]

4. **Forming Rectangles**: Each pair of vertices can form a rectangle with the other two vertices that are also part of the dodecagon. However, we need to ensure that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

5. **Valid Rectangles**: For each pair of vertices, we can check if they can form a rectangle with the other vertices. The key is to ensure that the vertices are arranged such that they can form a rectangle.

6. **Final Count**: After considering all valid combinations, we find that the total number of rectangles that can be formed is 66.

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in its exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the equations. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:

\[
39 + 4 = 43

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest four-digit number \( N \) such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let's denote \( N \) as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits, and \( a \neq 0 \) since \( N \) is a four-digit number.

First, consider the number \( N = abcd \). If we change the digit \( a \) to 1, the new number is \( 1bcd \). Similarly, if we change the digit \( b \) to 1, the new number is \( a1cd \), and so on. Therefore, the numbers \( 1bcd, a1cd, ab1d, \) and \( abc1 \) must all be divisible by 7.

We can express these numbers in terms of \( N \):
- \( 1bcd = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)
- \( a1cd = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \)
- \( ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \)
- \( abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)

Since each of these numbers is divisible by 7, their remainders when divided by 7 must be 0. We can write:
\[ 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

First, we find the remainders of the constants modulo 7:
\[ 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Substituting these into the congruences, we get:
\[ 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

We can simplify these congruences:
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

From the fourth congruence, we can isolate \( 6a + 2b + 3c \):
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

Now we have the system:
\[ 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

We can solve this system step by step. First, subtract the first congruence from the second:
\[ (6a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) \equiv 5 - 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a - 2b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3a - b \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 3a - 2 \pmod{7} \]

Next, subtract the first congruence from the third:
\[ (6a + 2b + d) - (2b + 3c + d) \equiv 4 - 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a - 3c \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2a - c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 2a - 1 \pmod{7} \]

Now substitute \( b \) and \( c \) into the fourth congruence:
\[ 6a + 2(3a - 2) + 3(2a - 1) \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 6a + 6a - 4 + 6a - 3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 18a - 7 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 4a \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2a \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ a \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]

Since \( a \) is a digit from 1 to 9, we have \( a = 5 \). Now substitute \( a = 5 \) back into the expressions for \( b \) and \( c \):
\[ b \equiv 3(5) - 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 15 - 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 13 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b = 6 \]

\[ c \equiv 2(5) - 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 10 - 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 9 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c = 2 \]

Finally, substitute \( a = 5 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = 2 \) into the first congruence to find \( d \):
\[ 2(6) + 3(2) + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 12 + 6 + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 18 + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 4 + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv -3 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d = 4 \]

\[ R = 5624 \mod 1000 = 624 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is externally tangent to the sphere \( S \) when the torus is outside the sphere. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle with radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

First, let's find the inner radius \( r_i \). When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is the sum of the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle and the radius of the sphere minus the radius of the circle on the torus. The radius of the circle on the torus is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle minus the radius of the circle that generates the torus.

The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle is 6 units, and the radius of the circle that generates the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the radius of the circle on the torus is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is \( 6 + 11 - 3 = 14 \) units. Thus, the inner radius \( r_i \) is 14 units.

Next, let's find the outer radius \( r_o \). When the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is the sum of the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle and the radius of the sphere plus the radius of the circle on the torus. The radius of the circle on the torus is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle plus the radius of the circle that generates the torus.

The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle is 6 units, and the radius of the circle that generates the torus is 3 units. Therefore, the radius of the circle on the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle on the torus is \( 6 + 11 + 9 = 26 \) units. Thus, the outer radius \( r_o \) is 26 units.

The difference between the inner radius and the outer radius is \( r_i - r_o = 14 - 26 = -12 \). Since we are asked for the absolute difference, we have \( |r_i - r_o| = 12 \).

This is because if there were chips of different colors in the grid, there would be a row or a column with chips of different colors, which would violate the condition.

There are only two possible configurations:
1. All 25 chips are white.
2. All 25 chips are black.

In both configurations, no additional chip can be placed without violating the condition that each row and each column contains chips of the same color. Therefore, there are exactly 2 valid ways to place the chips.

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",902,"[902, '902']",True
