"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we start by using the properties of the incircle and the tangents to the circle.

First, we calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\) of the triangle:
\[
s = \frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12.
\]

The lengths of the tangents from a point outside a circle to the points of tangency are equal. Therefore, the tangents from \(A\) to the points of tangency on \(BC\) and \(AC\) are equal, and the tangents from \(B\) to the points of tangency on \(AC\) and \(AB\) are equal, and the tangents from \(C\) to the points of tangency on \(AB\) and \(BC\) are equal. Let the points of tangency on \(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\) be \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) respectively. Then:
\[
AF = AE = s - BC = 12 - 9 = 3,
\]
\[
BF = BD = s - AC = 12 - 10 = 2,
\]
\[
CD = CE = s - AB = 12 - 5 = 7.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(AD\) is a cevian of the triangle and it intersects the circumcircle \(\omega\) again at point \(P\). By the Power of a Point theorem (also known as the Power of a Point theorem for a point on the circumcircle), we have:
\[
AP \cdot PD = AD \cdot AD.
\]
However, a more straightforward approach is to use the formula for the length of the tangent segment from a vertex to the point where the cevian intersects the circumcircle. This formula is given by:
\[
AP = \frac{AB \cdot AC}{AB + AC} = \frac{5 \cdot 10}{5 + 10} = \frac{50}{15} = \frac{10}{3}.
\]

Thus, the length \(AP\) is \(\frac{10}{3}\). In this fraction, \(m = 10\) and \(n = 3\), and they are coprime. Therefore, the sum \(m + n\) is:
\[
m + n = 10 + 3 = 13.
\]

The final answer is:
\[

"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs of the equations \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = x - \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \frac{1}{2} - x \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < 0 \), \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = \frac{1}{2} + x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{2} \right| = -x - \frac{1}{2} \).

Thus, \( f(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
The function \( g(x) \) can be broken down as follows:
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = x - \frac{1}{4} \).
- For \( 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{1}{4} - x \).
- For \( -\frac{1}{4} \leq x < 0 \), \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = \frac{1}{4} + x \).
- For \( x < -\frac{1}{4} \), \( g(x) = \left| -x - \frac{1}{4} \right| = -x - \frac{1}{4} \).

Thus, \( g(x) \) is symmetric about the y-axis and has a minimum value of 0 at \( x = \pm \frac{1}{4} \).

### Step 3: Analyze \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) is periodic with period 1 and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 4: Analyze \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) is periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\) and ranges from -1 to 1, \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) will range from 0 to 1.

### Step 5: Determine the number of intersection points
The graphs of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) are both symmetric about the line \( y = x \) and each ranges from 0 to 1. To find the number of intersection points, we need to consider the behavior of these functions.

Since both functions are continuous and periodic, and they both map the interval [0, 1] onto itself, they will intersect at exactly 6 points. This is because the function \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) completes 2 full cycles in the interval [0, 1], and the function \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) completes 3 full cycles in the interval [0, 1]. Each cycle of \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) intersects each cycle of \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) exactly once, resulting in \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) intersection points.

Thus, the number of intersection points is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",385,"[385, '385']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime number \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or one of these factors must be divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let's check the smallest primes. If \( p = 2 \), then:
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv n^4 + 1 \pmod{2}.
\]
Since \( n^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{2} \), \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \) or \( 0 \pmod{2} \). Therefore, \( n^4 + 1 \) is not divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \) for any odd \( n \). For \( n = 2k \) (even), we have:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (2k)^4 + 1 = 16k^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}.
\]
Thus, \( n^4 + 1 \) is not divisible by 4 for any \( n \). Therefore, \( p = 2 \) is not a solution.

Next, let's check \( p = 3 \). We need to find \( n \) such that:
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}.
\]
We can check the values of \( n \) modulo 3:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{9} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 7 \pmod{9} \).
Thus, \( n^4 + 1 \) is not divisible by 9 for any \( n \). Therefore, \( p = 3 \) is not a solution.

Next, let's check \( p = 5 \). We need to find \( n \) such that:
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
\]
We can check the values of \( n \) modulo 5:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \equiv 7 \pmod{25} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \equiv 7 \pmod{25} \).
Thus, \( n^4 + 1 \) is not divisible by 25 for any \( n \). Therefore, \( p = 5 \) is not a solution.

Next, let's check \( p = 17 \). We need to find \( n \) such that:
\[
n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289}.
\]
We can check the values of \( n \) modulo 17:
- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2^4 + 1 \equiv 16 + 1 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 3^4 + 1 \equiv 81 + 1 \equiv 82 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 4^4 + 1 \equiv 256 + 1 \equiv 257 \pmod{289} \).

- If \( n \equiv 8 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 8^4 + 1 \equiv 4096 + 1 \equiv 4097 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 9 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 9^4 + 1 \equiv 6561 + 1 \equiv 6562 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 10 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 10^4 + 1 \equiv 10000 + 1 \equiv 10001 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 11 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 11^4 + 1 \equiv 14641 + 1 \equiv 14642 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 12 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 12^4 + 1 \equiv 20736 + 1 \equiv 20737 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 13 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 13^4 + 1 \equiv 28561 + 1 \equiv 28562 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 14 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 14^4 + 1 \equiv 38416 + 1 \equiv 38417 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 15 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 15^4 + 1 \equiv 50625 + 1 \equiv 50626 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).
- If \( n \equiv 16 \pmod{17} \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 16^4 + 1 \equiv 65536 + 1 \equiv 65537 \equiv 17 \pmod{289} \).

Thus, \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 289 for \( n \equiv 16 \pmod{17} \). Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) is 17.

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We already know that \( m \equiv 16 \pmod{17} \). We can check the values of \( m \) modulo 289:
- If \( m \equiv 16 \pmod{289} \), then \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 16^4 + 1 \equiv 65536 + 1 \equiv 65537 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \).

Thus, the smallest positive integer \( m \) is 16.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the largest sphere that can fit inside a rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius \( r \) will be the smallest possible value that satisfies the condition that the sphere can fit inside the box.

First, let's denote the dimensions of the box by \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The volume of the box is given by:
\[ abc = 23. \]
The surface area of the box is given by:
\[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54. \]

"To solve the given problem, we start with the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). We will convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). By the definition of logarithms, this can be rewritten as:
\[x^{10} = y^x.\]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Similarly, this can be rewritten as:
\[y^{10} = x^{4y}.\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[x^{10} = y^x,\]
\[y^{10} = x^{4y}.\]

To eliminate the exponents, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:
\[\ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x),\]
\[10 \ln x = x \ln y.\]
Rearranging gives:
\[\frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{10}{x}.\]

Next, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:
\[\ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}),\]
\[10 \ln y = 4y \ln x.\]
Rearranging gives:
\[\frac{\ln y}{\ln x} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}.\]

Now we have two expressions for \(\frac{\ln y}{\ln x}\):
\[\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}.\]
Cross-multiplying gives:

\[xy = 25.\]

"To determine for which values of \( n \) Bob can ensure a win, we need to analyze the game and identify the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if any move from that position leads to a winning position, and a winning position is one from which there is at least one move to a losing position.

Let's start by identifying the smallest losing positions:
- If \( n = 1 \), Alice wins immediately by taking the last token.
- If \( n = 2 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 1 token, and Bob wins.
- If \( n = 3 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 2 tokens, and Bob wins.
- If \( n = 4 \), Alice wins immediately by taking the last token.
- If \( n = 5 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 4 tokens, and Bob wins.
- If \( n = 6 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 5 tokens, and Bob wins.
- If \( n = 7 \), Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 6 tokens, and Bob wins.
- If \( n = 8 \), Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving Bob with 4 tokens, and Bob wins.

From the above, we see that the losing positions are \( n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 \). Notice that these are all numbers that are not multiples of 5. Let's generalize this pattern.

If \( n \) is a multiple of 5, then Alice can always take 1 token, leaving Bob with \( n-1 \) tokens, which is not a multiple of 5. Bob will then be forced to leave Alice with a number of tokens that is a multiple of 5, and this process will continue until Alice wins. Therefore, the losing positions are all multiples of 5.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) that are less than or equal to 2024 and are multiples of 5. The multiples of 5 less than or equal to 2024 are \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \). This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a = 5 \), the common difference \( d = 5 \), and the last term \( l = 2020 \).

The number of terms \( k \) in this sequence can be found using the formula for the \( k \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ l = a + (k-1)d \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 2020 = 5 + (k-1) \cdot 5 \]
\[ 2020 = 5 + 5(k-1) \]
\[ 2020 = 5k \]
\[ k = \frac{2020}{5} = 404 \]

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) that are less than or equal to 2024 and are multiples of 5 is \(\boxed{404}\).","[404, '404']",809,"[809, '809']",False

"To solve for the length of \( CE \), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the shapes involved.

1. **Identify the given lengths and shapes:**
   - Rectangle \( ABCD \) with \( AB = 107 \) and \( BC = 16 \).
   - Rectangle \( EFGH \) with \( EF = 184 \) and \( FG = 17 \).
   - Points \( D, E, C, F \) are collinear.
   - Points \( A, D, H, G \) lie on a circle.

2. **Determine the coordinates of the points:**
   - Place \( D \) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Place \( C \) at \((16, 0)\).
   - Place \( B \) at \((16, 107)\).
   - Place \( A \) at \((0, 107)\).

3. **Find the coordinates of \( E \) and \( F \):**
   - Since \( D, E, C, F \) are collinear and \( E \) is on the extension of \( DC \), let \( E \) be at \((x, 0)\).
   - Since \( F \) is on the extension of \( CB \), let \( F \) be at \((16, y)\).

4. **Use the given lengths \( EF = 184 \) and \( FG = 17 \):**
   - The distance \( EF \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs \( x - 16 \) and \( y \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 16)^2 + y^2} = 184
     \]
   - The distance \( FG \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs \( 16 - 16 = 0 \) and \( y - 17 \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     |y - 17| = 17
     \]
     This gives us two possible values for \( y \):
     \[
     y - 17 = 17 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 17 = -17

     Solving these, we get:
     \[
     y = 34 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 0

5. **Determine the correct value of \( y \):**
   - If \( y = 0 \), then \( F \) would be at \((16, 0)\), which is the same as \( C \). This is not possible because \( E, C, F \) are distinct points.
   - Therefore, \( y = 34 \), and \( F \) is at \((16, 34)\).

6. **Find the value of \( x \):**
   - Substitute \( y = 34 \) into the equation for \( EF \):
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 16)^2 + 34^2} = 184

     Simplify inside the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 16)^2 + 1156} = 184

     Square both sides:

     Subtract 1156 from both sides:
     \[

     Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     x - 16 = \pm 181
     \]
     This gives us two possible values for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 197 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -165

     Since \( E \) is on the extension of \( DC \) to the right, we have:
     \[
     x = 197

     Therefore, \( E \) is at \((197, 0)\).

"To determine the number of paths of length 16 on an \(8 \times 8\) grid that start at the bottom-left corner and end at the top-right corner, and change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Path Representation**: Each path can be represented as a sequence of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. Since the path changes direction exactly four times, it must have exactly four R's followed by U's and four U's followed by R's.

2. **Direction Changes**: A direction change occurs when an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R. Therefore, we need to place 4 R's and 4 U's in the sequence such that there are exactly four direction changes.

3. **Counting Valid Sequences**: To count the number of valid sequences, we can use the concept of permutations with restrictions. We need to place 4 R's and 4 U's in a sequence such that no two consecutive R's or U's are the same.

4. **Using Combinatorics**: The problem can be solved by considering the number of ways to arrange 4 R's and 4 U's such that no two consecutive elements are the same. This is equivalent to finding the number of valid permutations of the sequence ""RRRRUUUU"" where no two consecutive elements are the same.

5. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the number of valid permutations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the number of valid permutations of a sequence of length \(n\) with \(k\) R's and \(k\) U's, where no two consecutive elements are the same, is given by \(2 \times (k!)^2\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) given the information about the circles inscribed in it. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are two circles tangent to sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\).
   - There are eight circles with diameter 34 tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle.
   - There are 2024 circles with diameter 1 tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle.
   - We need to find the inradius of triangle \(ABC\) and express it in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers, and then find \(m+n\).

2. **Analyzing the Circles:**
   - The eight circles with diameter 34 form a chain of circles tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is equal to the sum of their radii, which is \(17 + 17 = 34\).
   - The 2024 circles with diameter 1 form another chain of circles tangent to each other and to the sides of the triangle. The distance between the centers of two adjacent circles is \(1 + 1 = 2\).

3. **Calculating the Total Distance:**
   - The total distance covered by the centers of the eight circles with diameter 34 is \(7 \times 34 = 238\).
   - The total distance covered by the centers of the 2024 circles with diameter 1 is \(2023 \times 2 = 4046\).

4. **Relating the Distances to the Inradius:**
   - The total distance covered by the centers of all the circles is the sum of the distances covered by the two chains of circles, which is \(238 + 4046 = 4284\).
   - This total distance is equal to the perimeter of the triangle minus twice the inradius (since the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side of the triangle, and each side is counted twice in the perimeter).

5. **Using the Formula for the Perimeter:**
   - Let \(s\) be the semiperimeter of the triangle and \(r\) be the inradius. The perimeter of the triangle is \(2s\).
   - Therefore, we have \(2s - 2r = 4284\), which simplifies to \(s - r = 2142\).

6. **Finding the Inradius:**
   - The inradius \(r\) is also given by the formula \(r = \frac{A}{s}\), where \(A\) is the area of the triangle.
   - However, we can use the fact that the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side of the triangle, and this distance is the same for all sides.
   - Since the total distance covered by the centers of the circles is 4284, and this distance is equal to the perimeter minus twice the inradius, we can solve for \(r\).

7. **Solving for \(r\):**
   - From \(s - r = 2142\), we can express \(s\) as \(s = r + 2142\).
   - The inradius \(r\) is the distance from the incenter to each side of the triangle, and this distance is the same for all sides.
   - Therefore, the inradius \(r\) is \(\frac{4284}{2} = 2142\).

8. **Expressing the Inradius in the Form \(\frac{m}{n}\):**
   - The inradius \(r\) is \(\frac{2142}{1}\), where \(m = 2142\) and \(n = 1\).
   - Since \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, we have \(m + n = 2142 + 1 = 2143\).

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{2143}\).","[2143, '2143']",197,"[197, '197']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the square \(ABCD\).

The equation of the hyperbola is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
\]
Since the diagonals of the square \(ABCD\) intersect at the origin and are perpendicular to each other, we can assume that the vertices of the square are symmetric with respect to the origin. Let the vertices be \(A(x_1, y_1)\), \(B(-y_1, x_1)\), \(C(-x_1, -y_1)\), and \(D(y_1, -x_1)\).

Since \(A(x_1, y_1)\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the hyperbola's equation:
\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1
\]

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is the distance between the points \(B(-y_1, x_1)\) and \(D(y_1, -x_1)\). Using the distance formula, we get:
\[
BD = \sqrt{(y_1 - (-y_1))^2 + (-x_1 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(2y_1)^2 + (-2x_1)^2} = \sqrt{4y_1^2 + 4x_1^2} = 2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}
\]

We need to find the maximum value of \(BD^2\):
\[
BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)
\]

From the hyperbola's equation, we can express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):
\[
y_1^2 = 24 \left( \frac{x_1^2}{20} - 1 \right) = \frac{24}{20}x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24
\]

Substituting \(y_1^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 4 \left( x_1^2 + \frac{6}{5}x_1^2 - 24 \right) = 4 \left( \frac{11}{5}x_1^2 - 24 \right) = \frac{44}{5}x_1^2 - 96
\]

To maximize \(BD^2\), we need to maximize \(x_1^2\). Since \(x_1^2\) can be arbitrarily large, the term \(\frac{44}{5}x_1^2\) will also be arbitrarily large. However, the problem asks for the second smallest value of \(BD^2\), which implies we need to consider the smallest positive value of \(x_1^2\) that satisfies the hyperbola's equation.

The smallest positive value of \(x_1^2\) is 20 (since \(x_1^2\) must be greater than 20 to satisfy the hyperbola's equation). Substituting \(x_1^2 = 20\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44}{5} \cdot 20 - 96 = \frac{880}{5} - 96 = 176 - 96 = 80
\]

Therefore, the second smallest value of \(BD^2\) is:

"To solve for \( AB \cdot AC \) in the given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the specified conditions, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) of \( \triangle ABC \).
   - \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \).
   - The circumradius \( R = 13 \).
   - The inradius \( r = 6 \).

2. **Use the relationship between the circumradius \( R \), the inradius \( r \), and the distance \( d \) between the circumcenter and the incenter:**
   The formula for the distance \( d \) between the circumcenter and the incenter is given by:
   \[
   d^2 = R(R - 2r)
   \]
   Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
   \[
   d^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13
   \]
   Therefore, \( d = \sqrt{13} \).

3. **Use the condition \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \):**
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the point \( A \) lies on the circle with diameter \( OI \). The radius of this circle is \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{2} \).

4. **Relate the sides of the triangle to the circumradius and inradius:**
   The formula for the area \( \Delta \) of \( \triangle ABC \) in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the inradius \( r \) is:
   \[
   \Delta = r \cdot s = \frac{abc}{4R}
   \]
   where \( s \) is the semiperimeter and \( a, b, c \) are the sides of the triangle.

5. **Use the identity for the product of the sides of a triangle:**
   The product of the sides \( AB \cdot AC \) can be expressed in terms of the area and the other sides. However, a more direct approach is to use the fact that in a triangle with \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the product \( AB \cdot AC \) can be found using the formula:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = c \cdot b = 4R^2 \left(1 - \frac{r^2}{R^2}\right)
   \]
   Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \):
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = 4 \cdot 13^2 \left(1 - \frac{6^2}{13^2}\right) = 4 \cdot 169 \left(1 - \frac{36}{169}\right) = 4 \cdot 169 \cdot \frac{133}{169} = 4 \cdot 133 = 532

"To find the number of non-negative integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by analyzing the given conditions.

First, we rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca).
\]
Given that \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000.
\]
Solving for \(ab + bc + ca\), we get:
\[
ab + bc + ca = 20,000.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\),
2. \(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\).

We need to find non-negative integer solutions to this system. Consider the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
t^3 - 300t^2 + 20,000t - abc = 0.
\]

To find possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we can use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be integers that satisfy both equations. Let's test some possible values. Suppose \(a = 100\). Then the equations become:
\[
b + c = 200,
\]
\[
100b + 100c + bc = 20,000.
\]
Substituting \(c = 200 - b\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
100b + 100(200 - b) + b(200 - b) = 20,000,
\]
\[
20,000 + 200b - b^2 = 20,000,
\]
\[
200b - b^2 = 0,
\]
\[
b(200 - b) = 0.
\]
Thus, \(b = 0\) or \(b = 200\). If \(b = 0\), then \(c = 200\), and if \(b = 200\), then \(c = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\).

By symmetry, if we assume \(a = 200\), then the solutions are \((200, 100, 0)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\). And if we assume \(a = 0\), then the solutions are \((0, 100, 200)\), \((100, 0, 200)\), and \((100, 200, 0)\), which are already counted.

Thus, the distinct solutions are \((100, 0, 200)\), \((100, 200, 0)\), and \((0, 100, 200)\), \((200, 100, 0)\), \((200, 0, 100)\), and \((0, 200, 100)\). There are 6 such solutions.

Therefore, the number of non-negative integer triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the given conditions is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",601,"[601, '601']",True

"To solve the problem, we start by considering the 13th roots of unity. Let \(\omega\) be a primitive 13th root of unity, which means \(\omega^{13} = 1\) and \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(1 \leq k < 13\). The 13th roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\).

We need to find the value of the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

First, observe that \(\omega^{2k}\) is also a 13th root of unity because \((\omega^{2k})^{13} = (\omega^{13})^{2k} = 1^{2k} = 1\). Therefore, \(\omega^{2k}\) is one of the 13th roots of unity.

We can rewrite the expression inside the product as:
\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}
\]

To simplify the product, we consider the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity. The polynomial is:
\[
P(x) = x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1)
\]

The roots of \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1 = 0\) are \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{12}\). We need to evaluate the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial \(x^{12} + x^{11} + \cdots + x + 1\) can be written as:
\[
Q(x) = \prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \omega^k)
\]

We need to evaluate:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

This can be done by considering the polynomial \(R(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\) and evaluating the product:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} R(\omega^k)
\]

Using properties of roots of unity and symmetric polynomials, we can find that:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = 13

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers. A \( b \)-beautiful integer \( n \) is defined as a positive integer whose representation in base \( b \) contains exactly two digits, and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Step 1: Understanding the Representation in Base \( b \)

In base \( b \), a two-digit number can be represented as \( ab + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits, and \( 0 \leq a, c < b \). The number \( n \) can be expressed as:

\[
n = ab + c
\]

### Step 2: Condition for \( b \)-Beautiful Integers

For \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful, we need:

1. The sum of the digits \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).
2. Since \( n = ab + c \), we can express \( c \) as:

\[
c = n - ab
\]

Substituting \( c \) into the sum condition gives:

\[
a + (n - ab) = \sqrt{n}
\]

Rearranging this, we have:

\[
n - ab + a = \sqrt{n}
\]

### Step 3: Finding the Range of \( n \)

The maximum value of \( n \) in base \( b \) with two digits is \( b^2 - 1 \) (which is \( (b-1)(b-1) \) in base \( b \)). The minimum value is \( b \) (which is \( 10_b \)). Thus, \( n \) must satisfy:

\[
b \leq n < b^2
\]

### Step 4: Counting \( b \)-Beautiful Integers

To find how many \( b \)-beautiful integers exist, we need to check for each \( n \) in the range \( [b, b^2 - 1] \) if it can be expressed as \( ab + c \) such that \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).

### Step 5: Iterating Over Bases

We will start checking from \( b = 2 \) and increase \( b \) until we find a base where there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers.

1. **For \( b = 2 \)**:
   - Possible \( n \): \( 2, 3 \)
   - Beautiful integers: \( 2, 3 \) (2 beautiful integers)

2. **For \( b = 3 \)**:
   - Possible \( n \): \( 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \)
   - Beautiful integers: \( 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \) (6 beautiful integers)

3. **For \( b = 4 \)**:
   - Possible \( n \): \( 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 \)
   - Beautiful integers: \( 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 \) (12 beautiful integers)

### Conclusion

We found that for \( b = 4 \), there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers. Therefore, the smallest base \( b \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers is:

"To determine how many squares can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) such that each side of the square is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we need to analyze the possible configurations of these squares.

First, let's consider the properties of a regular dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has 12 equal sides and 12 equal angles. The vertices of the dodecagon can be labeled as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_{12}\) in a clockwise manner.

### Step 1: Identify the possible side lengths of the squares
The side length of a square can be either the length of a side of the dodecagon or the length of a diagonal. The diagonals of a regular dodecagon can be categorized into different lengths based on the number of vertices they skip. For example:
- A diagonal that skips 1 vertex (e.g., \(A_1A_3\)) is longer than a side.
- A diagonal that skips 2 vertices (e.g., \(A_1A_4\)) is even longer, and so on.

### Step 2: Determine the possible squares
We need to find all possible squares that can be formed using these side lengths. Let's consider the different cases:

#### Case 1: Squares with side length equal to a side of the dodecagon
If the side length of the square is equal to a side of the dodecagon, then the square can be formed by connecting four consecutive vertices of the dodecagon. For example, \(A_1A_2A_3A_4\) forms a square. Since the dodecagon has 12 vertices, there are 12 such squares.

#### Case 2: Squares with side length equal to a diagonal that skips 1 vertex
If the side length of the square is equal to a diagonal that skips 1 vertex, then the square can be formed by connecting vertices that are two positions apart in the dodecagon. For example, \(A_1A_3A_5A_7\) forms a square. Since the dodecagon has 12 vertices, there are 12 such squares.

#### Case 3: Squares with side length equal to a diagonal that skips 2 vertices
If the side length of the square is equal to a diagonal that skips 2 vertices, then the square can be formed by connecting vertices that are three positions apart in the dodecagon. For example, \(A_1A_4A_7A_{10}\) forms a square. Since the dodecagon has 12 vertices, there are 12 such squares.

#### Case 4: Squares with side length equal to a diagonal that skips 3 vertices
If the side length of the square is equal to a diagonal that skips 3 vertices, then the square can be formed by connecting vertices that are four positions apart in the dodecagon. For example, \(A_1A_5A_9A_{13}\) (where \(A_{13} = A_1\)) forms a square. Since the dodecagon has 12 vertices, there are 12 such squares.

### Step 3: Sum the number of squares
Adding up all the possible squares from the different cases, we get:
\[12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 48\]

Therefore, the total number of squares that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon such that each side of the square is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",315,"[315, '315']",False

"To find the length of the side of the regular hexagon, we start by understanding the relationship between the side length of the hexagon and the lengths of the sides of the triangles formed by extending its sides.

A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. If the side length of the hexagon is \( s \), then each side of the equilateral triangle is also \( s \).

When we extend the sides of the hexagon, we form 6 isosceles triangles outside the hexagon. Each of these isosceles triangles has two sides equal to the side length of the hexagon, \( s \), and a base equal to the length of the side of the triangle formed by extending the sides of the hexagon.

Given that the lengths of the sides of these triangles are 200, 240, and 300, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. However, in this case, we can use the property of the regular hexagon and the fact that the sides of the triangles are formed by extending the sides of the hexagon.

The key insight is that the sum of the lengths of the sides of the triangles that are not adjacent to each other is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the triangles that are adjacent to each other. This is because each side of the hexagon is shared by two triangles.

Therefore, we can write:
\[ 200 + 240 + 300 = 3s \]

Solving for \( s \):

Bob creates sets \( B \) such that each set \( B \) is a subset of \( A \), is non-empty, and does not contain all elements of \( A \). Additionally, the maximum element of each set \( B \) must be an element of \( A \).

Given that Bob creates 2024 such sets \( B \), we need to determine the elements of \( A \) and their sum.

First, let's denote the elements of \( A \) as \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) where \( a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \). The maximum element of any set \( B \) must be one of the elements of \( A \). For each element \( a_i \) in \( A \), the sets \( B \) that have \( a_i \) as their maximum element are all subsets of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}, a_i\} \) that include \( a_i \) and do not include all elements of \( A \).

The number of such subsets is \( 2^{i-1} - 1 \) (since there are \( 2^{i-1} \) subsets of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}\} \) and we exclude the empty subset and the subset that includes all elements of \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{i-1}\} \) to ensure \( B \) is not equal to \( A \)).

The total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of these counts for all elements of \( A \):
\[
(2^1 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + \cdots + (2^{n-1} - 1) = (2^1 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-1}) - (n-1) = (2^n - 2) - (n-1) = 2^n - n - 1

We are given that the total number of sets \( B \) is 2024, so we need to solve the equation:
\[

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 11 = \frac{11(11+1)}{2} = \frac{11 \cdot 12}{2} = 66

2. Replacing \( b \) with 1: \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \) is divisible by 7.
3. Replacing \( c \) with 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \) is divisible by 7.
4. Replacing \( d \) with 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \) is divisible by 7.

We can express these conditions in terms of congruences modulo 7:
1. \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

First, we find the remainders of the base numbers modulo 7:
- \( 1000 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 100 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

Substituting these into the congruences, we get:
1. \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

We can simplify these congruences:
1. \( 2b + 3c + d \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
2. \( 6a + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)
3. \( 6a + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)
4. \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

From the fourth congruence, we get:
\[ 6a + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

We can now use these congruences to find the largest possible value of \( N \). We start with the largest possible digit for \( a \), which is 9, and work our way down.

Let's try \( a = 9 \):
\[ 6(9) + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 + 2b + 3c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

This is the same as the first congruence, so it is consistent. Now we need to find \( b \) and \( c \) such that:
\[ 6(9) + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 + 3c + d \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d \equiv 4c \pmod{7} \]

And:
\[ 6(9) + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 54 + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 5 + 2b + d \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + d \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

Substituting \( d = 4c \) into the second congruence:
\[ 2b + 4c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

We now have the system:
\[ 2b + 3c \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 4c \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]

Subtracting the first congruence from the second:
\[ c \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Substituting \( c = 5 \) back into the first congruence:
\[ 2b + 3(5) \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
\[ 2b \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
\[ b = 0 \]

Finally, substituting \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 5 \) into \( d = 4c \):
\[ d = 4(5) = 20 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
\[ d = 6 \]

Thus, the largest four-digit number \( N \) is \( 9056 \).

Now, we need to find \( Q \) and \( R \):
\[ Q = \left\lfloor \frac{9056}{1000} \right\rfloor = 9 \]
\[ R = 9056 \mod 1000 = 56 \]

Finally, we find \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 9 + 56 = 65 \]

The answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 25 chips on a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and no chip is placed in a cell that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a chip of the same color.

First, let's consider the color constraints. Since each row and each column must contain chips of the same color, the entire grid must be filled with either all white chips or all black chips. However, this would violate the condition that no chip is adjacent to a chip of the same color. Therefore, it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",902,"[902, '902']",True
