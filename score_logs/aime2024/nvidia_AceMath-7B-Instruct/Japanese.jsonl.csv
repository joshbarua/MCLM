"To solve for the length \(AP\) in the given problem, we start by using the properties of the circle and the triangle. The key property we will use is the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point \(D\) outside a circle, the power of the point with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of any secant line passing through the point and the circle.

Given that \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents to the circle \(\omega\) at points \(B\) and \(C\), and \(\overline{AD}\) intersects the circle again at point \(P\), we can apply the Power of a Point theorem at point \(D\). The theorem tells us that:
\[
DB^2 = DC^2 = DP \cdot DA
\]

First, we need to find the lengths \(DB\) and \(DC\). Since \(D\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\), the lengths of the tangents from \(D\) to the points of tangency are equal. We can use the formula for the length of the tangent from a point outside a circle to the points of tangency, which is given by:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{AB \cdot AC}
\]

Substituting the given side lengths \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), we get:
\[
DB = DC = \sqrt{5 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Now, we use the Power of a Point theorem:
\[
DB^2 = DP \cdot DA
\]
\[
(5\sqrt{2})^2 = DP \cdot DA
\]
\[
50 = DP \cdot DA
\]

Next, we need to express \(DA\) in terms of \(AP\) and \(DP\). Since \(A\) is a point on the circle and \(P\) is another point on the circle such that \(D\) lies on \(\overline{AD}\), we have:
\[
DA = AP + DP
\]

Substituting \(DA\) in the Power of a Point equation, we get:
\[
50 = DP \cdot (AP + DP)
\]

Let \(AP = x\) and \(DP = y\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
50 = y \cdot (x + y)
\]
\[
50 = xy + y^2
\]

We also know that \(y = \frac{50}{x + y}\). To find \(x\), we need to solve this quadratic equation. However, we can use the fact that \(x\) and \(y\) are related by the Power of a Point theorem and the properties of the triangle. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of the segments of the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the other two sides:
\[
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{CD}
\]

Since \(BD = DC\), we have:
\[
\frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This implies that \(x\) is a fraction of the total length of the segment \(AD\). Using the fact that \(x\) and \(y\) are related by the Power of a Point theorem, we can solve for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + y}}
\]

Solving this equation, we find:
\[
x = \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + \cdots}}}
\]

This is a continued fraction that converges to:
\[
x = \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + \cdots}}}
\]

Solving this, we find:
\[
x = \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + \cdots}}}
\]

Finally, we find:
\[
x = \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + \frac{50}{x + \cdots}}}
\]

Thus, the length \(AP\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{50}{11}}
\]

"To determine the number of intersection points of the graphs \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \), we need to analyze the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) and their compositions.

First, let's define the functions:
\[ f(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]
\[ g(x) = \left| \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \right| \]

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is a piecewise function based on the value of \( x \):
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \left| x \right| \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( g(x) \)
Similarly, the function \( g(x) \) is a piecewise function:
- If \( \left| x \right| \geq \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \left| x \right| - \frac{1}{4} \).
- If \( \left| x \right| < \frac{1}{4} \), then \( g(x) = \frac{1}{4} - \left| x \right| \).

### Step 3: Simplify the given equations
We need to find the intersection points of:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]

### Step 4: Determine the range of \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \)
Since \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) both range from \(-1\) to \(1\):
- \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Step 5: Determine the range of \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \)
Since \( f(\sin(2 \pi x)) \) and \( f(\cos(3 \pi y)) \) both range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\):
- \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).
- \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) ranges from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

### Step 6: Simplify the equations further
Thus, the equations become:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]
where \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) and \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) both range from \(0\) to \(\frac{1}{4}\).

### Step 7: Analyze the intersection points
Since both \( y \) and \( x \) range from \(0\) to \(1\), we need to find the points where:
\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \]
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \]

### Step 8: Consider the periodicity and symmetry
Both \( \sin(2 \pi x) \) and \( \cos(3 \pi y) \) are periodic functions. The function \( g(f(\sin(2 \pi x))) \) is symmetric and periodic with period \(1\), and the function \( g(f(\cos(3 \pi y))) \) is symmetric and periodic with period \(\frac{2}{3}\).

### Step 9: Count the intersection points
Given the periodicity and symmetry, we can count the intersection points in one period and then extend to the entire domain. By analyzing the graphs and their intersections, we find that there are 6 intersection points in one period.

### Final Answer
Thus, the number of intersection points of the graphs is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, let's consider the polynomial \( n^4 + 1 \). We can factorize it as follows:
\[
n^4 + 1 = (n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1)(n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1).
\]
For \( n^4 + 1 \) to be divisible by \( p^2 \), \( p \) must divide both \( n^2 + \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) and \( n^2 - \sqrt{2}n + 1 \) or their product must be divisible by \( p^2 \). This implies that \( p \) must be a prime number that divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \).

Let's test small prime numbers to find the smallest \( p \).

1. **For \( p = 2 \):**
   \[
   n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2},
   \]
   so \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 2 \).

2. **For \( p = 3 \):**
   We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \). Let's test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   &1^4 + 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &2^4 + 1 = 17 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &3^4 + 1 = 82 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &4^4 + 1 = 257 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &5^4 + 1 = 626 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &6^4 + 1 = 1297 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &7^4 + 1 = 2402 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\
   &8^4 + 1 = 4097 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{9}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 9 \).

3. **For \( p = 5 \):**
   We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \). Let's test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 24 \):

   &10^4 + 1 = 10001 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
   &11^4 + 1 = 14642 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\

   &17^4 + 1 = 83522 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\
   &18^4 + 1 = 104977 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}, \\

   &24^4 + 1 = 331777 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{25}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   So, \( n^4 + 1 \) is never divisible by \( 25 \).

4. **For \( p = 17 \):**
   We need to check if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \). Let's test \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 16 \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   &1^4 + 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &2^4 + 1 = 17 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &3^4 + 1 = 82 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &4^4 + 1 = 257 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &5^4 + 1 = 626 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &6^4 + 1 = 1297 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &7^4 + 1 = 2402 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
   &8^4 + 1 = 4097 \equiv 0 \pmod{289}.
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   So, \( n = 8 \) is a solution. Therefore, the smallest prime \( p \) is \( 17 \).

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). We already know that \( m = 8 \) is a solution. To confirm that it is the smallest, we can check the next few values:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&9^4 + 1 = 6562 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&10^4 + 1 = 10001 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&11^4 + 1 = 14642 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&12^4 + 1 = 20737 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&13^4 + 1 = 28562 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&14^4 + 1 = 38417 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&15^4 + 1 = 50626 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}, \\
&16^4 + 1 = 65537 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{289}.

"To solve the given problem, we start with the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). We will convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.

First, consider the equation \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). By the definition of logarithms, this can be rewritten as:
\[ x^{10} = y^x. \]

Next, consider the equation \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Similarly, this can be rewritten as:
\[ y^{10} = x^{4y}. \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( x^{10} = y^x \)
2. \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \)

To eliminate one of the variables, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation. Starting with the first equation:
\[ \ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \]
\[ 10 \ln(x) = x \ln(y) \]
\[ \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{10}{x}. \]

Next, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the second equation:
\[ \ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \]
\[ 10 \ln(y) = 4y \ln(x) \]
\[ \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)} = \frac{4y}{10} = \frac{2y}{5}. \]

Since both expressions are equal to \(\frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)}\), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ \frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}. \]

To solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[ 50 = 2xy \]
\[ xy = 25. \]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).","[25, '25']",25,"[25, '25']",True
"To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) such that Bob can always win the game, we need to analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move will win if both players play optimally.

Let's define the positions:
- \( L \) is a losing position.
- \( W \) is a winning position.

The key observation is that a position is losing if and only if all moves from that position lead to a winning position. Conversely, a position is winning if there is at least one move that leads to a losing position.

We start by identifying the smallest positions:
- \( n = 1 \): The player who moves first takes the only token and wins. Therefore, \( n = 1 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 2 \): The player who moves first can only take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the second player, who then wins. Therefore, \( n = 2 \) is a losing position \( L \).
- \( n = 3 \): The player who moves first can only take 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the second player, who then loses. Therefore, \( n = 3 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 4 \): The player who moves first can take either 1 token or 4 tokens. If they take 1 token, 3 tokens remain, which is a winning position for the second player. If they take 4 tokens, the game is over and they win. Therefore, \( n = 4 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 5 \): The player who moves first can take either 1 token or 4 tokens. If they take 1 token, 4 tokens remain, which is a winning position for the second player. If they take 4 tokens, 1 token remains, which is a winning position for the second player. Therefore, \( n = 5 \) is a losing position \( L \).

We can see a pattern emerging. Let's generalize this pattern:
- \( n = 6 \): The player who moves first can take either 1 token or 4 tokens. If they take 1 token, 5 tokens remain, which is a losing position for the second player. If they take 4 tokens, 2 tokens remain, which is a losing position for the second player. Therefore, \( n = 6 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 7 \): The player who moves first can take either 1 token or 4 tokens. If they take 1 token, 6 tokens remain, which is a winning position for the second player. If they take 4 tokens, 3 tokens remain, which is a winning position for the second player. Therefore, \( n = 7 \) is a losing position \( L \).
- \( n = 8 \): The player who moves first can take either 1 token or 4 tokens. If they take 1 token, 7 tokens remain, which is a losing position for the second player. If they take 4 tokens, 4 tokens remain, which is a winning position for the second player. Therefore, \( n = 8 \) is a winning position \( W \).
- \( n = 9 \): The player who moves first can take either 1 token or 4 tokens. If they take 1 token, 8 tokens remain, which is a winning position for the second player. If they take 4 tokens, 5 tokens remain, which is a losing position for the second player. Therefore, \( n = 9 \) is a winning position \( W \).

From the above, we can see that the losing positions are \( n = 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, \ldots \). These positions form an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 2 \) and common difference \( d = 3 \). The general term of this sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 3 = 3n - 1 \]

\[ 3n - 1 \leq 2024 \]
\[ 3n \leq 2025 \]
\[ n \leq 675 \]

"To solve the problem of finding the number of paths from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of an \(8 \times 8\) grid that change direction exactly 4 times, we need to consider the nature of these paths.

1. **Understanding the Path**: A path from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner consists of 8 right moves (R) and 8 up moves (U). The total length of the path is 16 moves.

2. **Direction Changes**: A direction change occurs when we switch from moving right to moving up or vice versa. We need to find paths that have exactly 4 direction changes.

3. **Path Representation**: Each path can be represented as a sequence of Rs and Us. For example, a path might look like RRRUURRRUUUUURRRU.

4. **Counting Direction Changes**: To have exactly 4 direction changes, we need to place 4 points where the direction changes. This means we will have 5 segments of Rs and Us. For example, a valid path might look like RRRUURRRUUUUURRRU, where the direction changes occur at the boundaries of the segments.

5. **Choosing Segments**: We need to choose 4 points out of the 15 possible points (after the first move) where the direction changes. This can be done in \(\binom{15}{4}\) ways.

6. **Calculating the Combinations**: The number of ways to choose 4 points from 15 is given by the binomial coefficient:

"To find the maximum real part of the expression \((75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in its polar form. Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z} = (75+117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96+144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (300+468i)e^{i\theta} + (24+36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Next, we use the Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\). Substituting these in, we get:
\[
(300+468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24+36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).

Expanding both terms, we have:

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 36\sin\theta) + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i = (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i.
\]

The real part of this expression is:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To find the maximum value of this real part, we use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\), so the maximum value is:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus. The hyperbola is given by:

The length of the diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\), so \(BD^2 = 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\).

Since \(A\) lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation of the hyperbola:

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{20} - \frac{y_1^2}{24} = 1

We need to maximize \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) under this constraint. To do this, we express \(y_1^2\) in terms of \(x_1^2\):

Substituting this into \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\), we get:

\[
x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_1^2 + \frac{6}{5} x_1^2 - 24 = \frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24
\]

To maximize \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\), we need to maximize \(\frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24\). Since \(x_1^2\) can be arbitrarily large, the expression \(\frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24\) can be made arbitrarily large. However, we are asked to find the largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\). This means we need to find the maximum value of \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) that is less than the value of \(BD^2\) for any valid \(x_1\).

The value of \(BD^2\) is \(4(x_1^2 + y_1^2)\), and the maximum value of \(x_1^2 + y_1^2\) is \(\frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is:

\[
4 \left( \frac{11}{5} x_1^2 - 24 \right) = \frac{44}{5} x_1^2 - 96
\]

Since \(x_1^2\) can be arbitrarily large, the maximum value of \(BD^2\) is also arbitrarily large. However, the largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) is the value of \(BD^2\) when \(x_1^2\) is at its minimum value, which is 20. Substituting \(x_1^2 = 20\) into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{11}{5} \cdot 20 - 24 = 44 - 24 = 20
\]

Therefore, the largest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) is:

"To determine the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items (diamond ring, golf club set, garden spade, and candy heart), we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( D \) be the set of residents who own a diamond ring.
- Let \( G \) be the set of residents who own a golf club set.
- Let \( S \) be the set of residents who own a garden spade.
- Let \( C \) be the set of residents who own a candy heart.

We are given the following information:
- The total number of residents is \( |U| = 900 \).
- The number of residents who own a diamond ring is \( |D| = 195 \).
- The number of residents who own a golf club set is \( |G| = 367 \).
- The number of residents who own a garden spade is \( |S| = 562 \).
- The number of residents who own a candy heart is \( |C| = 900 \) (since everyone has a candy heart).
- The number of residents who own exactly 2 items is \( |D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |D \cap C| + |G \cap S| + |G \cap C| + |S \cap C| - 3|D \cap G \cap S| - 3|D \cap G \cap C| - 3|D \cap S \cap C| - 3|G \cap S \cap C| + 6|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| = 437 \).
- The number of residents who own exactly 3 items is \( |D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap C| + |D \cap S \cap C| + |G \cap S \cap C| - 4|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| = 234 \).

We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, which is \( |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the total number of residents who own at least one item is:
\[ |D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |D \cap C| - |G \cap S| - |G \cap C| - |S \cap C| + |D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap C| + |D \cap S \cap C| + |G \cap S \cap C| - |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \]

Since everyone has a candy heart, \( |D \cup G \cup S \cup C| = 900 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (|D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |D \cap C| + |G \cap S| + |G \cap C| + |S \cap C|) + (|D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap C| + |D \cap S \cap C| + |G \cap S \cap C|) - |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \]

We know that:
\[ |D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |D \cap C| + |G \cap S| + |G \cap C| + |S \cap C| = 437 + 3|D \cap G \cap S| + 3|D \cap G \cap C| + 3|D \cap S \cap C| + 3|G \cap S \cap C| - 6|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \]
\[ |D \cap G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap C| + |D \cap S \cap C| + |G \cap S \cap C| = 234 + 4|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \]

Substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula, we get:
\[ 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (437 + 3(234 + 4|D \cap G \cap S \cap C|) - 6|D \cap G \cap S \cap C|) + (234 + 4|D \cap G \cap S \cap C|) - |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \]
\[ 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 437 - 702 - 12|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| + 6|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| + 234 + 4|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| - |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \]
\[ 900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 437 - 702 + 234 - 3|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \]
\[ 900 = 1029 - 3|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| \]
\[ 3|D \cap G \cap S \cap C| = 129 \]
\[ |D \cap G \cap S \cap C| = 43 \]

"To find the value of \( AB \cdot AC \) in the given triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we start by using the given conditions: the external center \( O \) and the internal center \( I \) satisfy \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), the circumradius \( R = 13 \), and the inradius \( r = 6 \).

First, we use the fact that \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). This condition implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \). This is a well-known geometric property of triangles where the line segment joining the incenter and the circumcenter is perpendicular to the angle bisector of the right angle.

For a right triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is half the length of the hypotenuse \( BC \). Therefore, we have:
\[
BC = 2R = 2 \times 13 = 26.
\]

Next, we use the formula for the area of a right triangle in terms of its legs \( AB \) and \( AC \):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} AB \cdot AC.
\]
We can also express the area in terms of the inradius \( r \) and the semiperimeter \( s \):
\[
\text{Area} = r \cdot s.
\]
The semiperimeter \( s \) is given by:
\[
s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \frac{AB + AC + 26}{2}.
\]
Thus, the area can be written as:
\[
\text{Area} = 6 \cdot \frac{AB + AC + 26}{2} = 3(AB + AC + 26).
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} AB \cdot AC = 3(AB + AC + 26).
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain:
\[
AB \cdot AC = 6(AB + AC + 26).
\]
We also use the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle:
\[
AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 = 26^2 = 676.
\]
We now have two equations:
1. \( AB \cdot AC = 6(AB + AC + 26) \)
2. \( AB^2 + AC^2 = 676 \)

Let \( AB + AC = x \) and \( AB \cdot AC = y \). Then the equations become:
1. \( y = 6(x + 26) \)
2. \( x^2 - 2y = 676 \) (since \( (AB + AC)^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 + 2AB \cdot AC \))

Substituting \( y = 6(x + 26) \) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2 \cdot 6(x + 26) = 676.
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
x^2 - 12x - 312 = 676.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 12x - 988 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -12 \), and \( c = -988 \):
\[
x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 3952}}{2} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{4096}}{2} = \frac{12 \pm 64}{2}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = \frac{76}{2} = 38 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-52}{2} = -26.
\]
Since \( x = AB + AC \) must be positive, we have \( x = 38 \). Substituting \( x = 38 \) back into the equation \( y = 6(x + 26) \), we get:
\[
y = 6(38 + 26) = 6 \cdot 64 = 384.
\]
Therefore, the value of \( AB \cdot AC \) is:
\[
\boxed{384}.

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300 \]
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. \]

First, we can rewrite the second equation in a more symmetric form. Notice that:
\[ a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca). \]
Substituting \( a + b + c = 300 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000. \]
Solving for \( ab + bc + ca \), we find:
\[ ab + bc + ca = 20,000. \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ a + b + c = 300, \]
\[ ab + bc + ca = 20,000. \]

We need to find non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy these equations. Let's assume without loss of generality that \( a \leq b \leq c \). Since \( a + b + c = 300 \), we have \( c = 300 - a - b \). Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[ ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b) = 20,000. \]
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:
\[ ab + 300b - ab - b^2 + 300a - a^2 - ab = 20,000, \]
\[ 300a + 300b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 20,000. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + ab - 300a - 300b + 20,000 = 0. \]

To find integer solutions, we can use the quadratic formula for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{300 - a \pm \sqrt{(300 - a)^2 - 4(a^2 - 300a + 20,000)}}{2}. \]
Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get:
\[ b = \frac{300 - a \pm \sqrt{90,000 - 600a + a^2 - 4a^2 + 1200a - 80,000}}{2}, \]
\[ b = \frac{300 - a \pm \sqrt{10,000 + 600a - 3a^2}}{2}. \]
For \( b \) to be an integer, the expression under the square root must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by \( k^2 \):
\[ 10,000 + 600a - 3a^2 = k^2. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 3a^2 - 600a + k^2 - 10,000 = 0. \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( a \). The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square:
\[ \Delta = 600^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (k^2 - 10,000) = 360,000 - 12k^2 + 120,000 = 480,000 - 12k^2. \]
\[ \Delta = 12(40,000 - k^2). \]
For \( \Delta \) to be a perfect square, \( 40,000 - k^2 \) must be a perfect square. Let \( 40,000 - k^2 = m^2 \):
\[ 40,000 = k^2 + m^2. \]
The pairs \((k, m)\) that satisfy this equation are \((200, 0)\), \((160, 120)\), and \((120, 160)\), and \((0, 200)\). However, since \( k \) must be positive, we discard \((0, 200)\). Therefore, the valid pairs are \((200, 0)\), \((160, 120)\), and \((120, 160)\).

For each pair, we solve for \( a \) and \( b \):
1. If \( k = 200 \) and \( m = 0 \):
   \[ 10,000 + 600a - 3a^2 = 200^2, \]
   \[ 10,000 + 600a - 3a^2 = 40,000, \]
   \[ 3a^2 - 600a + 30,000 = 0, \]
   \[ a^2 - 200a + 10,000 = 0, \]
   \[ a = 100. \]
   Then \( b = 100 \) and \( c = 100 \). The solution is \((100, 100, 100)\).

2. If \( k = 160 \) and \( m = 120 \):
   \[ 10,000 + 600a - 3a^2 = 160^2, \]
   \[ 10,000 + 600a - 3a^2 = 25,600, \]
   \[ 3a^2 - 600a + 15,600 = 0, \]
   \[ a^2 - 200a + 5,200 = 0, \]
   \[ a = 100 \pm 20\sqrt{3}. \]
   Since \( a \) must be an integer, there are no integer solutions in this case.

3. If \( k = 120 \) and \( m = 160 \):
   \[ 10,000 + 600a - 3a^2 = 120^2, \]
   \[ 10,000 + 600a - 3a^2 = 14,400, \]
   \[ 3a^2 - 600a + 4,400 = 0, \]
   \[ a^2 - 200a + 1,466.67 = 0. \]
   Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions in this case.

Therefore, the only solution is \((100, 100, 100)\). Since the order of \( a, b, \) and \( c \) does not matter, there is only one distinct solution.

The number of non-negative integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",601,"[601, '601']",True

"To determine the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there are at least 10 \( b \)-beautiful integers, we need to understand the conditions under which a number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-beautiful if it is a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's express \( n \) in base \( b \). If \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), then we can write:
\[ n = ab + c \]
where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits of \( n \) in base \( b \), and \( 1 \le a < b \) and \( 0 \le c < b \). The condition for \( n \) to be \( b \)-beautiful is:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{n} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (a + c)^2 = n \]
Substituting \( n = ab + c \) into the equation, we have:
\[ (a + c)^2 = ab + c \]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = ab + c \]
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - ab - c = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation in \( c \):
\[ c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - ab) = 0 \]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \( c \) to be an integer. The discriminant is:
\[ \Delta = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a^2 - ab) = 4a^2 - 4a + 1 - 4a^2 + 4ab = 4ab - 4a + 1 \]
For \( c \) to be an integer, \( 4ab - 4a + 1 \) must be a perfect square. Let's test values of \( b \) starting from the smallest possible value.

For \( b = 2 \):
\[ 4a(2) - 4a + 1 = 4a + 1 \]
This is not a perfect square for any \( a \ge 1 \).

For \( b = 3 \):
\[ 4a(3) - 4a + 1 = 8a + 1 \]
This is not a perfect square for any \( a \ge 1 \).

For \( b = 4 \):
\[ 4a(4) - 4a + 1 = 12a + 1 \]
This is not a perfect square for any \( a \ge 1 \).

For \( b = 5 \):
\[ 4a(5) - 4a + 1 = 16a + 1 \]
This is not a perfect square for any \( a \ge 1 \).

For \( b = 6 \):

This is not a perfect square for any \( a \ge 1 \).

For \( b = 7 \):
\[ 4a(7) - 4a + 1 = 24a + 1 \]
This is not a perfect square for any \( a \ge 1 \).

For \( b = 8 \):
\[ 4a(8) - 4a + 1 = 28a + 1 \]
This is not a perfect square for any \( a \ge 1 \).

For \( b = 9 \):
\[ 4a(9) - 4a + 1 = 32a + 1 \]
This is not a perfect square for any \( a \ge 1 \).

For \( b = 10 \):
\[ 4a(10) - 4a + 1 = 36a + 1 \]
This is a perfect square for \( a = 1 \) (since \( 36(1) + 1 = 37 \) is not a perfect square) and \( a = 2 \) (since \( 36(2) + 1 = 73 \) is not a perfect square) and so on.

For \( b = 11 \):
\[ 4a(11) - 4a + 1 = 40a + 1 \]
This is a perfect square for \( a = 1 \) (since \( 40(1) + 1 = 41 \) is not a perfect square) and \( a = 2 \) (since \( 40(2) + 1 = 81 = 9^2 \) is a perfect square).

So, for \( b = 11 \), \( a = 2 \) and \( c = 7 \) is a solution, giving \( n = 2 \cdot 11 + 7 = 29 \) and \( \sqrt{29} = 5 \).

We need to find at least 10 such \( b \)-beautiful integers. Let's check \( b = 12 \):
\[ 4a(12) - 4a + 1 = 44a + 1 \]
This is a perfect square for \( a = 1 \) (since \( 44(1) + 1 = 45 \) is not a perfect square) and \( a = 2 \) (since \( 44(2) + 1 = 89 \) is not a perfect square) and so on.

For \( b = 13 \):
\[ 4a(13) - 4a + 1 = 48a + 1 \]
This is a perfect square for \( a = 1 \) (since \( 48(1) + 1 = 49 = 7^2 \) is a perfect square) and \( a = 2 \) (since \( 48(2) + 1 = 97 \) is not a perfect square) and so on.

We can see that \( b = 13 \) gives us at least 10 \( b \)-beautiful integers. Therefore, the smallest integer \( b \ge 2 \) such that there are at least 10 \( b \)-beautiful integers is:

"To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in exponential form. The given equations are:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Rewriting these equations in exponential form, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}
\]
\[
\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]
\[
\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

The left side simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}
\]

We can combine the right side using the property of exponents \(a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^p = a^{m+n+p}\):

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot \sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}} = 2^{\frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:

\[
xyz = 2^{-\frac{13}{12}}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\). Using the property of logarithms \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\), we have:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z)
\]

From the original equations, we can express \(\log_2(x)\), \(\log_2(y)\), and \(\log_2(z)\) in terms of \(\log_2(2)\):

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \log_2(x) - \log_2(yz) = \log_2(x) - (\log_2(y) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \log_2(y) - \log_2(xz) = \log_2(y) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(z)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \log_2(z) - \log_2(xy) = \log_2(z) - (\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). Then we have the system:

\[
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
b - a - c = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding all three equations together, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (b - a - c) + (c - a - b) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]
\[
a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

Now, we can find \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the system of equations. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\) and the symmetry of the equations. We can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is 9, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the expression \(a + b + c\). Therefore, we can use the fact that the value of \(4a + 3b + 2c\) is \(\frac{13}{12}\) times the sum of the coefficients of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = \frac{13}{12} \cdot 9 = \frac{117}{12} = \frac{39}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\) is \(\frac{39}{4}\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is:

\[
39 + 4 = 43
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radii \( r_i \) and \( r_o \) of the circles along which the torus \( T \) is in contact with the sphere \( S \) when the torus is in the innermost and outermost positions, respectively. The torus \( T \) is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Step 1: Determine the inner radius \( r_i \)
When the torus is in the innermost position, it is tangent to the sphere at a point on the inner surface of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that forms the torus is 6 units. The radius of the circle is 3 units, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the inner surface of the torus is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) units. Since the sphere has a radius of 11 units, the radius \( r_i \) of the circle along which the torus is in contact with the sphere is:
\[
r_i = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

### Step 2: Determine the outer radius \( r_o \)
When the torus is in the outermost position, it is tangent to the sphere at a point on the outer surface of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the circle that forms the torus is still 6 units. The radius of the circle is 3 units, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the outer surface of the torus is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) units. Since the sphere has a radius of 11 units, the radius \( r_o \) of the circle along which the torus is in contact with the sphere is:
\[
r_o = 11 - 9 = 2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference \( r_i - r_o \)
The difference between the inner radius and the outer radius is:
\[
r_i - r_o = 8 - 2 = 6
\]

### Step 4: Express the difference in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) and find \( m + n \)
The difference \( r_i - r_o \) is already in the form \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 1 \). Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, we have:
\[
m + n = 6 + 1 = 7
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 25 chips (13 white and 12 black) in a \(5 \times 5\) grid such that each row and each column contains chips of the same color, and adding any additional chip would violate one of the conditions.

First, let's consider the structure of the grid. Since each row and each column must contain chips of the same color, the entire grid must be filled with chips of a single color. This is because if there were chips of different colors in the grid, there would be a row or a column with mixed colors, which would violate the condition.

Given that there are 13 white chips and 12 black chips, the only way to fill the grid is to place all 25 chips of one color. Since there are only two colors, there are exactly 2 possible ways to fill the grid: either all white or all black.

However, we need to check if adding any additional chip would violate the conditions. If we place all 25 chips of one color, adding any additional chip of the same color would still satisfy the conditions, but adding a chip of the opposite color would violate the condition that each row and each column contains chips of the same color. Therefore, the only valid configurations are the ones where the grid is completely filled with either all white or all black chips.

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips in the grid is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",902,"[902, '902']",True
