"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

""Let triangle ABC be a triangle that lies on a circle ω. We need to construct points D and P such that the line segment BC passes through D, and the line segment AD passes through P. Additionally, we know that AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.""

Alright, so first, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. Points D and P are constructed such that BC passes through D, and AD passes through P. So, D is a point on BC, and P is a point on AD. I think this might be related to some circle theorems or perhaps power of a point.

Given the sides of the triangle: AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. So, triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me note that down.

First, maybe I should compute some key properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius, area, or angles. Since it's inscribed in a circle, knowing the circumradius might help.

Let me recall the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c:

R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area)

So, I need to find the area of triangle ABC. Since I know all three sides, I can use Heron's formula.

Heron's formula: area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

Let me compute s first.

s = (a + b + c) / 2 = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

So, s = 12.

Then, area = sqrt[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 6] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt[504]: 504 = 16 * 31.5, but that's not helpful. Let me factor it:

504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is 63/2. Hmm, maybe another way.

Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5 is not helpful. Let me factor 504:

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 = 126

126 ÷ 2 = 63

63 ÷ 3 = 21

21 ÷ 3 = 7

So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7

Therefore, sqrt[504] = sqrt[2^3 * 3^2 * 7] = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2 * sqrt(2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 6 * sqrt(14)

Wait, let me check that:

sqrt[2^3 * 3^2 * 7] = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2 * sqrt(2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 6 * sqrt(14). Yes, that's correct.

So, area = 6 * sqrt(14).

Therefore, the circumradius R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area) = (5 * 9 * 10) / (4 * 6 * sqrt(14)).

Compute numerator: 5 * 9 = 45, 45 * 10 = 450.

Denominator: 4 * 6 = 24, so 24 * sqrt(14) = 24 sqrt(14).

So, R = 450 / (24 sqrt(14)) = (450 / 24) / sqrt(14) = (75 / 4) / sqrt(14) = 75 / (4 sqrt(14)).

Rationalizing the denominator: 75 sqrt(14) / (4 * 14) = 75 sqrt(14) / 56.

So, R = (75 sqrt(14)) / 56.

Hmm, okay. So, the circumradius is 75 sqrt(14)/56.

But I'm not sure if this is directly useful yet. Maybe I need to find coordinates or something.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me try that.

Let me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let me put point B at (0, 0), point C at (9, 0), since BC = 9. Then, point A is somewhere in the plane. I need to find coordinates of A such that AB = 5 and AC = 10.

So, coordinates:

Let me denote point A as (x, y). Then, distance from A to B is 5: sqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 5 => x^2 + y^2 = 25.

Distance from A to C is 10: sqrt[(x - 9)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 10 => (x - 9)^2 + y^2 = 100.

Subtract the first equation from the second:

(x - 9)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 100 - 25 => x^2 - 18x + 81 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 75 => -18x + 81 = 75 => -18x = -6 => x = (-6)/(-18) = 1/3.

So, x = 1/3. Then, from the first equation, x^2 + y^2 = 25 => (1/3)^2 + y^2 = 25 => 1/9 + y^2 = 25 => y^2 = 25 - 1/9 = 225/9 - 1/9 = 224/9 => y = sqrt(224/9) = (sqrt(224))/3 = (sqrt(16*14))/3 = 4 sqrt(14)/3.

So, point A is at (1/3, 4 sqrt(14)/3).

Alright, so coordinates:

B: (0, 0)

C: (9, 0)

A: (1/3, 4 sqrt(14)/3)

Now, we need to construct points D and P such that BC passes through D, and AD passes through P.

Wait, so D is a point on BC, which is the line segment from (0,0) to (9,0). So, D must be somewhere along the x-axis between B and C.

Similarly, P is a point on AD. So, P is somewhere along the line from A to D.

But the problem says ""pieska kašu ω punktos B un C krustotos punktā D"", which I think means that BC passes through D, so D is on BC. Similarly, ""lai AD krustotos ar ω punktā P"", meaning AD passes through P, so P is on AD.

So, D is on BC, and P is on AD.

But the problem is to find AP, which is the length from A to P.

Wait, but how do we find D and P? The problem doesn't specify where D is on BC, so maybe D is a specific point? Or perhaps it's a general point, and we need to find AP in terms of the given sides.

Wait, the problem says ""pieska kašu ω punktos B un C krustotos punktā D"", which might mean that BC is a chord of the circle passing through D, but since BC is a side of the triangle, which is inscribed in the circle, so BC is a chord of ω. So, D is another point on BC, but not necessarily the midpoint or anything.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's not specified where D is on BC. So, perhaps D is a specific point, maybe the foot of the altitude or something? Or maybe it's the intersection of BC with another line?

Wait, the problem says ""pieska kašu ω punktos B un C krustotos punktā D"", which is a bit unclear. Maybe it's saying that BC is a chord of ω passing through D, but since BC is already a side of the triangle, which is inscribed in ω, so BC is a chord. So, D is another point on BC, but not necessarily on the triangle.

Similarly, ""lai AD krustotos ar ω punktā P"", meaning that AD passes through P, which is another point on AD.

Wait, but the problem is to find AP, so maybe we need to find the position of D such that AP is minimized or something? Or perhaps it's a specific point.

Wait, maybe I misinterpret. Let me read again:

""Let triangle ABC be a triangle that lies on a circle ω. Lai pieskares ω punktos B un C krustotos punktā D, un lai AD krustotos ar ω punktā P. Ja AB=5, BC=9, un AC=10, AP var tikt izteikts formā m/n, kur m un n ir savstarpēji pirmskaitļi. Atrodiet m + n.""

So, the problem is: Given triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, inscribed in circle ω. We need to construct points D on BC and P on AD such that BC passes through D and AD passes through P. Then, find the length of AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and compute m + n.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify where D is on BC. So, is D the foot of the altitude from A? Or is it the midpoint? Or is it some other point?

Wait, maybe it's the intersection of BC with the circumcircle again? But BC is a chord, so it already passes through B and C, so D would coincide with B or C, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, maybe D is the point where the tangent at A meets BC? But the problem says ""pieska kašu ω punktos B un C krustotos punktā D"", which might mean that BC is a secant passing through D, but since BC is a side of the triangle, which is inscribed in ω, so BC is a chord, so D is another point on BC.

Wait, perhaps D is the intersection of BC with another line, but the problem doesn't specify. Maybe it's the point where the tangent at A meets BC? Or maybe it's the point where the symmedian meets BC?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe D is the point where BC is intersected by the tangent at A. Let me check.

If I can find the tangent at A, then it would intersect BC at some point D. Similarly, the line AD would pass through P, which is another point on AD.

Alternatively, maybe D is the foot of the altitude from A to BC. Let me compute that.

Given triangle ABC with coordinates A(1/3, 4 sqrt(14)/3), B(0,0), C(9,0). Let me compute the foot of the altitude from A to BC.

Since BC is on the x-axis, the foot of the altitude from A is just the projection of A onto BC, which is (x, 0) where x is the x-coordinate of A. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the foot of the altitude from A to BC is the point D such that AD is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is on the x-axis, its slope is 0, so the altitude from A is vertical. Therefore, the foot D has the same x-coordinate as A, which is 1/3, and y=0. So, D is (1/3, 0).

Wait, that's interesting. So, D is (1/3, 0). So, that's the foot of the altitude from A to BC.

So, if D is (1/3, 0), then AD is the line from A(1/3, 4 sqrt(14)/3) to D(1/3, 0). So, AD is a vertical line at x = 1/3.

Then, P is a point on AD, so P must be (1/3, y) for some y between 0 and 4 sqrt(14)/3.

But the problem says ""pieska kašu ω punktos B un C krustotos punktā D"", which I think is saying that BC passes through D, which is already the foot of the altitude. So, D is (1/3, 0). Then, P is a point on AD, which is the vertical line x=1/3.

But then, AP is the distance from A(1/3, 4 sqrt(14)/3) to P(1/3, y). So, AP = |4 sqrt(14)/3 - y|.

But the problem is to find AP, but it doesn't specify where P is. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps D is not the foot of the altitude, but another point on BC. Maybe it's the intersection of BC with the circumcircle again? But BC is a chord, so it already passes through B and C, so D would coincide with B or C, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe D is the intersection of BC with the tangent at A. Let me compute that.

The tangent at A to the circumcircle ω. The equation of the tangent at A can be found using the formula for the tangent to a circle at a point.

First, I need the equation of the circumcircle ω. Since it passes through A(1/3, 4 sqrt(14)/3), B(0,0), and C(9,0), I can find its equation.

Let me find the circumcircle equation.

General equation of a circle: x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Plugging in B(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.

Plugging in C(9,0): 81 + 0 + 9D + 0 + 0 = 0 => 81 + 9D =","[9, '9']",113,"[113, '113']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersection points between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem says f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So, both f and g are absolute value functions nested inside each other. Let me sketch their graphs to get a better idea.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's consider the inner function first: |x| - 1/2. This is a V-shaped graph shifted down by 1/2. The vertex of this V is at (0, -1/2). Then, taking the absolute value of that, we get f(x). So, f(x) will reflect any negative parts of |x| - 1/2 back up. Let me think about how this looks.

When |x| - 1/2 is positive, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. When |x| - 1/2 is negative, f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = -|x| + 1/2. So, f(x) is a piecewise function:

- For |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2.
- For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = -|x| + 1/2.

So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that peaks at (0, 1/2) and has its vertex at (0, 1/2). It tapers down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So, it's like a diamond shape with vertices at (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), (-1/2, 0).

Now, moving on to g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Similarly, let's break it down. The inner function is |x| - 1/4, which is a V shifted down by 1/4. The vertex is at (0, -1/4). Then, taking the absolute value, we get g(x). So, g(x) will reflect any negative parts back up.

So, g(x) is also a piecewise function:

- For |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.
- For |x| < 1/4, g(x) = -|x| + 1/4.

Therefore, g(x) is a V-shaped graph with a peak at (0, 1/4) and tapers down to (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0).

Okay, so f(x) and g(x) are both V-shaped functions, but f(x) is wider and taller than g(x). Now, the problem involves composing these functions with sine and cosine functions.

Let me first consider the first equation: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break this down.

First, sin(2πx) is a standard sine wave with period 1, oscillating between -1 and 1. Then, f is applied to this sine function. So, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Then, g is applied to that result: g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| - 1/4|. Then, y is 4 times that.

Similarly, the second equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's break this down as well.

First, cos(3πy) is a cosine wave with period 2/3, oscillating between -1 and 1. Then, f is applied to this cosine function: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. Then, g is applied to that result: g(f(cos(3πy))) = ||||cos(3πy)| - 1/2| - 1/4|. Then, x is 4 times that.

So, both equations involve compositions of f and g with sine and cosine functions, respectively. The challenge is to find the number of intersection points between y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Hmm, this seems quite involved. Maybe I can analyze each function step by step.

Let me first consider the function h(x) = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's see what h(x) looks like.

First, sin(2πx) is a periodic function with period 1, oscillating between -1 and 1. Then, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's analyze f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| ranges between 0 and 1. So, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Let me consider the function f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| where t is in [-1, 1]. So, t can be from -1 to 1, so |t| is from 0 to 1. Then, |t| - 1/2 is from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(t) is:

- For |t| ≥ 1/2, f(t) = |t| - 1/2.
- For |t| < 1/2, f(t) = -|t| + 1/2.

But since t = |sin(2πx)|, which is always non-negative, t is in [0, 1]. So, f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| = |t - 1/2| because t is non-negative.

Wait, hold on. Since t is non-negative, |t| = t, so f(t) = |t - 1/2|.

So, f(t) = |t - 1/2|, where t is in [0, 1]. So, f(t) is a V-shaped function with vertex at t = 1/2, f(t) = 0. It goes up to t = 0, f(t) = 1/2, and t = 1, f(t) = 1/2.

So, f(t) is a triangle wave from t=0 to t=1, peaking at t=1/2 with value 0, and going down to 1/2 at t=0 and t=1.

Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) is a triangle wave that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with period 1, because sin(2πx) has period 1.

Then, g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|. But since f(sin(2πx)) is already non-negative (as it's an absolute value), this simplifies to g(f(sin(2πx))) = |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

So, g(f(sin(2πx))) is the absolute value of f(sin(2πx)) minus 1/4. Let's analyze this.

We have f(sin(2πx)) as a triangle wave from 0 to 1/2, peaking at 1/2. So, f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) = |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

So, when f(sin(2πx)) is less than 1/4, g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)). When f(sin(2πx)) is greater than or equal to 1/4, g(f(sin(2πx))) = f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4.

So, let's find the points where f(sin(2πx)) = 1/4.

f(t) = |t - 1/2|, so |t - 1/2| = 1/4.

This gives t - 1/2 = 1/4 or t - 1/2 = -1/4.

So, t = 3/4 or t = 1/4.

Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/4 when sin(2πx) = 3/4 or sin(2πx) = 1/4.

So, sin(2πx) = 3/4 occurs at 2πx = arcsin(3/4) + 2πk or 2πx = π - arcsin(3/4) + 2πk, for integer k.

Similarly, sin(2πx) = 1/4 occurs at 2πx = arcsin(1/4) + 2πk or 2πx = π - arcsin(1/4) + 2πk, for integer k.

Therefore, the function g(f(sin(2πx))) will have different expressions depending on whether sin(2πx) is in [0, 1/4], [1/4, 3/4], or [3/4, 1].

So, let's break down the function g(f(sin(2πx))) into intervals:

1. When sin(2πx) ∈ [0, 1/4], f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/4], so g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)).

2. When sin(2πx) ∈ [1/4, 3/4], f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2], so g(f(sin(2πx))) = f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4.

3. When sin(2πx) ∈ [3/4, 1], f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/4], so g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)).

Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) is a piecewise function that is a V-shape with peaks at sin(2πx) = 1/4 and sin(2πx) = 3/4, and valleys at sin(2πx) = 0 and sin(2πx) = 1.

But since sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, the function g(f(sin(2πx))) will have a period of 1 as well.

So, over each interval of length 1, g(f(sin(2πx))) is a triangle wave that goes from 1/4 to 0 at sin(2πx) = 1/4, then back up to 1/4 at sin(2πx) = 0, then down to 0 at sin(2πx) = 1/4, and so on.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, when sin(2πx) is in [0, 1/4], g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)).

Since f(sin(2πx)) is a triangle wave from 0 to 1/2, so 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)) will be a triangle wave from 1/4 to 0.

Similarly, when sin(2πx) is in [1/4, 3/4], g(f(sin(2πx))) = f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4, which is a triangle wave from 0 to 1/4.

And when sin(2πx) is in [3/4, 1], g(f(sin(2πx))) = 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)), which is again a triangle wave from 1/4 to 0.

So, over each period of 1, the function g(f(sin(2πx))) goes from 1/4 to 0, then to 1/4, then to 0, and so on. So, it's a triangle wave with amplitude 1/4, peaking at 1/4, and going down to 0.

Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) is a triangle wave with period 1, amplitude 1/4, and midline 0.

Similarly, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will be this triangle wave scaled by 4, so it will have amplitude 1, peaking at 1, and going down to 0.

So, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a triangle wave with period 1, amplitude 1, midline 0.

Similarly, let's analyze the other function: x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let me denote h(y) = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's break this down.

First, cos(3πy) is a cosine function with period 2/3, oscillating between -1 and 1. Then, f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. Let's analyze f(t) where t = |cos(3πy)|.

Since t = |cos(3πy)|, t is in [0, 1]. So, f(t) = ||t| - 1/2| = |t - 1/2|, as before.

So, f(t) is a triangle wave from t=0 to t=1, peaking at t=1/2 with value 0, and going down to 1/2 at t=0 and t=1.

Therefore, f(cos(3πy)) is a triangle wave that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with period 2/3, because cos(3πy) has period 2/3, and f(t) is periodic with period 1, but since t = |cos(3πy)|, the period might be shorter.

Wait, let's think about the period of f(cos(3πy)).

Since cos(3πy) has period 2/3, and f(t) is a function of t, which is |cos(3πy)|, so the period of f(cos(3πy)) would be half of the period of cos(3πy), which is 1/3. Because |cos(3","[1/3.0, '1/3.']",385,"[385, '385']",False

1. **Identify the smallest \( p \):** We need to find the smallest \( p \) such that there exists an \( n \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \).

"Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). I need to find the inradius of the tetrahedron, which is the radius of the sphere inscribed inside it. The inradius can be expressed in the form m√n / p, where m, n, and p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be calculated using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.

Looking at the given edge lengths, I notice that opposite edges are equal: AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. This suggests that the tetrahedron might be isohedral or perhaps a disphenoid. I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which seems to fit here.

I recall that for a disphenoid, there's a formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths. Let me try to remember or derive it.

Alternatively, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to make calculations easier. Let me try that approach.

Let me assign coordinates to the vertices. Let's place vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Since AB = sqrt(41), let me place B at (x, 0, 0). Then, since AC = sqrt(80), point C can be at (a, b, 0). Similarly, point D will be somewhere in 3D space.

But wait, since BC = sqrt(89) and AD = sqrt(89), maybe I can find coordinates for D such that AD = sqrt(89) and CD = sqrt(41). Hmm, this might get complicated, but let's try.

Let me denote the coordinates:

A = (0, 0, 0)
B = (x, 0, 0)
C = (a, b, 0)
D = (c, d, e)

Now, let's write down the distances:

AB = sqrt(41): distance between A and B is sqrt((x)^2 + 0 + 0) = x = sqrt(41). So, x = sqrt(41). So, B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).

AC = sqrt(80): distance between A and C is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(80). So, a^2 + b^2 = 80.

BC = sqrt(89): distance between B and C is sqrt((a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2) = sqrt(89). So, (a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 = 89.

AD = sqrt(89): distance between A and D is sqrt(c^2 + d^2 + e^2) = sqrt(89). So, c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 89.

CD = sqrt(41): distance between C and D is sqrt((c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2) = sqrt(41). So, (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41.

BD = sqrt(80): distance between B and D is sqrt((c - sqrt(41))^2 + d^2 + e^2) = sqrt(80). So, (c - sqrt(41))^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 80.

Hmm, that's a lot of equations. Let me see if I can solve them step by step.

First, from AC: a^2 + b^2 = 80.

From BC: (a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 = 89.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

(a - sqrt(41))^2 + b^2 - (a^2 + b^2) = 89 - 80

Expanding (a - sqrt(41))^2: a^2 - 2a sqrt(41) + 41 + b^2 - a^2 - b^2 = 9

Simplify: -2a sqrt(41) + 41 = 9

So, -2a sqrt(41) = 9 - 41 = -32

Divide both sides by -2 sqrt(41): a = (-32)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41)

Rationalizing the denominator: a = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41

So, a = 16 sqrt(41)/41.

Now, from a^2 + b^2 = 80:

a^2 = (256 * 41) / (41^2) = 256 / 41

So, b^2 = 80 - 256 / 41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 2924 / 41

Wait, 80 is 3280/41, right? Because 80 * 41 = 3280.

So, b^2 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41

So, b = sqrt(3024 / 41). Let me simplify sqrt(3024):

3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7

So, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)

Thus, b = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(21/41)

So, b = 12 sqrt(21/41)

Okay, so now we have a and b.

Now, moving on to points C and D.

We have:

AD: c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 89

CD: (c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2 = 41

Subtracting CD from AD:

(c^2 + d^2 + e^2) - [(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2 + e^2] = 89 - 41 = 48

Expanding (c - a)^2: c^2 - 2ac + a^2

Similarly, (d - b)^2: d^2 - 2bd + b^2

So, subtracting:

c^2 + d^2 + e^2 - [c^2 - 2ac + a^2 + d^2 - 2bd + b^2 + e^2] = 48

Simplify:

c^2 + d^2 + e^2 - c^2 + 2ac - a^2 - d^2 + 2bd - b^2 - e^2 = 48

Simplify further:

2ac + 2bd - a^2 - b^2 = 48

We know a^2 + b^2 = 80, so:

2ac + 2bd - 80 = 48

Thus, 2ac + 2bd = 128

Divide both sides by 2:

ac + bd = 64

We have a = 16 sqrt(41)/41, b = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)

So, let's compute ac and bd.

First, ac = (16 sqrt(41)/41) * c

Similarly, bd = (12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) * d

So, ac + bd = 64

But we have two variables c and d, so we need another equation.

Looking back at the equations for AD and BD.

From AD: c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 89

From BD: (c - sqrt(41))^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 80

Subtract BD from AD:

(c^2 + d^2 + e^2) - [(c - sqrt(41))^2 + d^2 + e^2] = 89 - 80 = 9

Expanding (c - sqrt(41))^2: c^2 - 2c sqrt(41) + 41

So, subtracting:

c^2 + d^2 + e^2 - c^2 + 2c sqrt(41) - 41 - d^2 - e^2 = 9

Simplify:

2c sqrt(41) - 41 = 9

So, 2c sqrt(41) = 50

Thus, c = 50 / (2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41) = 25 sqrt(41)/41

So, c = 25 sqrt(41)/41

Now, plug c into ac + bd = 64.

We have:

a = 16 sqrt(41)/41, c = 25 sqrt(41)/41

So, ac = (16 sqrt(41)/41) * (25 sqrt(41)/41) = (16 * 25 * 41) / (41^2) = (400) / 41

Similarly, bd = 64 - ac = 64 - 400/41 = (64*41 - 400)/41 = (2624 - 400)/41 = 2224 / 41

So, bd = 2224 / 41

But b = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), so:

bd = (12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) * d = 2224 / 41

Thus, d = (2224 / 41) / (12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) = (2224 / 41) * (sqrt(41) / (12 sqrt(21)))

Simplify:

2224 / 41 = 54.441... Wait, 2224 divided by 41: 41*54=2214, so 2224-2214=10, so 54 + 10/41 = 54.2439...

But let's keep it as fractions.

2224 / 41 = 54.2439, but let's see:

2224 ÷ 41: 41*54=2214, 2224-2214=10, so 54 + 10/41.

So, d = (54 + 10/41) * sqrt(41) / (12 sqrt(21)) = [54 sqrt(41) + (10 sqrt(41))/41] / (12 sqrt(21))

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

d = (2224 / 41) / (12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) = (2224 / 41) * (sqrt(41) / (12 sqrt(21))) = (2224 sqrt(41)) / (41 * 12 sqrt(21)) = (2224 / 41) * (1 / 12) * (sqrt(41)/sqrt(21))

Simplify:

2224 / 41 = 54.2439, but let's see if 2224 and 41 have a common factor. 41 is prime, 2224 ÷ 41: 41*54=2214, 2224-2214=10, so 2224=41*54 +10, so 2224/41=54 +10/41.

So, d = (54 + 10/41) * (sqrt(41)/12 sqrt(21)) = [54 sqrt(41) + (10 sqrt(41))/41] / (12 sqrt(21))

Hmm, this is getting messy. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute d and e, I can find the volume using another method.

I remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a^2 + c^2 - b^2 - d^2)/4 )) / something... Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That might be a good approach.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume squared is equal to the determinant of the following matrix divided by 288:

| 0 1 1 1 1 |
|1 0 a² b² c²|
|1 a² 0 d² e²|
|1 b² d² 0 f²|
|1 c² e² f² 0 |

So, let's set up the matrix.

Given:

AB = sqrt(41) => a² = 41

AC = sqrt(80) => b² = 80

AD = sqrt(89) => c² = 89

BC = sqrt(89) => d² = 89

BD = sqrt(80) => e² = 80

CD = sqrt(41) => f² = 41

So, the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0,","[0, '0']",104,"[104, '104']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the solid body \(\mathcal{B}\) is a rectangular prism with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the square of the maximum possible radius \(r\) of a sphere that can fit inside the prism, which is determined by the smallest dimension of the prism.

First, we denote the dimensions of the prism as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area \(S\) and volume \(V\) of the prism are given by:
\[
S = 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
\]
\[
V = abc = 23
\]
We aim to maximize the radius \(r\) of a sphere that can fit inside the prism, which is limited by the smallest dimension. Therefore, we need to maximize the minimum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

To find the maximum possible \(r\), we consider the case where all dimensions are equal, i.e., the prism is a cube. However, since the surface area and volume do not correspond to a cube, we proceed by expressing the problem in terms of variables and applying optimization techniques.

We introduce variables \(x = a\), \(y = b\), and \(z = c\), and rewrite the surface area and volume equations:
\[
2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \quad \Rightarrow \quad xy + yz + xz = 27
\]
\[
xyz = 23
\]
We aim to maximize the minimum of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Without loss of generality, assume \(x \leq y \leq z\). Then, the maximum possible \(r\) is \(x\), and we need to maximize \(x\) under the given constraints.

To find the maximum \(x\), we express \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\). From the surface area equation:
\[
xy + yz + xz = 27
\]
\[
y(x + z) + xz = 27
\]
From the volume equation:
\[
xyz = 23 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{23}{xz}
\]
Substituting \(y\) into the surface area equation:
\[
\frac{23}{xz}(x + z) + xz = 27
\]
Let \(k = \frac{z}{x}\), then \(z = kx\). Substituting into the equation:
\[
\frac{23}{x(kx)}(x + kx) + x(kx) = 27
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{23}{k x^2} \cdot x(1 + k) + k x^2 = 27
\]
\[
\frac{23(1 + k)}{k x} + k x^2 = 27
\]
Let \(t = x^2\), then:
\[
\frac{23(1 + k)}{k \sqrt{t}} + k t = 27
\]
This equation is complex, so instead, we consider the case where \(x = y = z\), which would be a cube. However, as previously noted, a cube does not satisfy the given surface area and volume. Therefore, we need to find the maximum \(x\) such that the surface area and volume constraints are satisfied.

Using the AM-GM inequality, we know that for positive numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Applying this to the surface area and volume, we can derive bounds on \(x\).

However, a more straightforward approach is to use Lagrange multipliers to maximize \(x\) subject to the constraints:
\[
xy + yz + xz = 27
\]
\[
xyz = 23
\]
Setting up the Lagrangian:
\[
\mathcal{L} = x + \lambda(27 - xy - yz - xz) + \mu(23 - xyz)
\]
Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero:
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 1 - \lambda(y + z) - \mu(yz) = 0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 0 - \lambda(x + z) - \mu(xz) = 0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z} = 0 - \lambda(x + y) - \mu(xy) = 0
\]
Solving these equations, we find that \(x = y = z\), which again suggests a cube. However, since a cube does not satisfy the given surface area and volume, we must consider the case where the dimensions are not equal.

Instead, we assume \(x \leq y \leq z\) and express \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\). From the surface area equation:
\[
xy + yz + xz = 27
\]
\[
y(x + z) + xz = 27
\]
From the volume equation:
\[
xyz = 23 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{23}{xz}
\]
Substituting \(y\) into the surface area equation:
\[
\frac{23}{xz}(x + z) + xz = 27
\]
Let \(k = \frac{z}{x}\), then \(z = kx\). Substituting:
\[
\frac{23}{x(kx)}(x + kx) + x(kx) = 27
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{23(1 + k)}{k x} + k x^2 = 27
\]
Let \(t = x^2\), then:
\[
\frac{23(1 + k)}{k \sqrt{t}} + k t = 27
\]
This equation is complex, so instead, we consider the case where \(x = y = z\), which would be a cube. However, as previously noted, a cube does not satisfy the given surface area and volume. Therefore, we need to find the maximum \(x\) such that the surface area and volume constraints are satisfied.

Using the AM-GM inequality, we know that for positive numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Applying this to the surface area and volume, we can derive bounds on \(x\).

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the method of substitution. Let’s assume \(x = y\), then we can express \(z\) in terms of \(x\). From the surface area equation:
\[
2x^2 + 2xz = 27
\]
\[
x^2 + xz = 13.5
\]
From the volume equation:
\[
x^2 z = 23
\]
Solving for \(z\):
\[
z = \frac{23}{x^2}
\]
Substituting into the surface area equation:
\[
x^2 + x \cdot \frac{23}{x^2} = 13.5
\]
\[
x^2 + \frac{23}{x} = 13.5
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(x\):
\[
x^3 + 23 = 13.5x
\]
\[
x^3 - 13.5x + 23 = 0
\]
This cubic equation can be solved numerically. Using the rational root theorem, possible roots are factors of 23 over factors of 1, so \(x = 1\), \(x = 23\), etc. Testing \(x = 1\):
\[
1 - 13.5 + 23 = 10.5 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(x = 2\):
\[
8 - 27 + 23 = 4 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(x = 3\):
\[
27 - 40.5 + 23 = 9.5 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(x = 4\):
\[
64 - 54 + 23 = 33 \neq 0
\]
Testing \(x = 5\):
\[
125 - 67.5 + 23 = 80.5 \neq 0
\]
It seems there are no rational roots, so we need to use numerical methods. Using the Newton-Raphson method, we approximate the root. Let’s define \(f(x) = x^3 - 13.5x + 23\). The derivative \(f'(x) = 3x^2 - 13.5\).

Starting with \(x_0 = 2\):
\[
f(2) = 8 - 27 + 23 = 4
\]
\[
f'(2) = 12 - 13.5 = -1.5

Next iteration:
\[
x_1 = 2 - \frac{4}{-1.5} = 2 + 2.6667 = 4.6667

\[
f(4.6667) = (4.6667)^3 - 13.5(4.6667) + 23 \approx 102.3 - 62.5 + 23 = 62.8

\[
f'(4.6667) = 3(4.6667)^2 - 13.5 \approx 3(21.7778) - 13.5 = 65.3333 - 13.5 = 51.8333

Next iteration:
\[
x_2 = 4.6667 - \frac{62.8}{51.8333} \approx 4.6667 - 1.213 = 3.4537

\[
f(3.4537) = (3.4537)^3 - 13.5(3.4537) + 23 \approx 40.5 - 46.31 + 23 = 17.19

\[
f'(3.4537) = 3(3.4537)^2 - 13.5 \approx 3(11.92) - 13.5 = 35.76 - 13.5 = 22.26

f(2.6817) = (2.6817)^3 - 13.5(2.6817) + 23 \approx 19.4 - 36.23 + 23 = 6.17
\]
\[
f'(2.6817) = 3(2.6817)^2 - 13.5 \approx 3(7.19) - 13.5 = 21.57 - 13.5 = 8.07
\]
Next iteration:
\[
x_4 = 2.6817 - \frac{6.17}{8.07} \approx 2.6817 - 0.764 = 1.9177

\[
f(1.9177) = (1.9177)^3 - 13.5(1.9177) + 23 \approx 7.0 - 25.81 + 23 = 4.19

\[
f'(1.9177) = 3(1.9177)^2 - 13.5 \approx 3(3.68) - 13.5 = 11.04 - 13.5 = -2.46
\]
Next iteration:
\[
x_5 = 1.9177 - \frac{4.19}{-2.46} \approx 1.9177 + 1.703 = 3.6207

\[
f(3.6207) = (3.6207)^3 - 13.5(3.6207) + 23 \approx 47.5 - 48.83 + 23 = 21.67

\[
f'(3.6207) = 3(3.6207)^2 - 13.5 \approx 3(13.11) - 13.5 = 39.33 - 13.5 = 25.83

Next iteration:

"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Then, I have to find the product xy. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have some properties that might help here. The equation log_x(y^x) = 10. I think I can use the logarithm power rule here, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that to the first equation, I can rewrite log_x(y^x) as x * log_x(y). So, that gives me x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I notice that both equations involve log_x(y) and log_y(x). Maybe I can express one in terms of the other. I recall that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say, let’s set a = log_y(x). Then, log_x(y) would be 1/a.

Substituting these into the equations:

1. x * (1/a) = 10
2. 4y * a = 10

So, equation 1 becomes x/a = 10, which means x = 10a.

Equation 2 becomes 4y * a = 10, so y = 10 / (4a) = 5 / (2a).

Now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of a. But I also know that a is log_y(x). Let me write that down:

a = log_y(x)

But since x = 10a and y = 5/(2a), I can substitute these into the expression for a.

So, a = log_{5/(2a)}(10a)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can use the change of base formula to express this logarithm in terms of natural logarithms or something else. The change of base formula says that log_b(c) = ln(c) / ln(b). So, applying that here:

a = ln(10a) / ln(5/(2a))

So, now I have an equation in terms of a:

a = ln(10a) / ln(5/(2a))

This looks a bit messy, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me denote t = a for simplicity. So, the equation becomes:

t = ln(10t) / ln(5/(2t))

I can rewrite the denominator as ln(5) - ln(2t) because ln(5/(2t)) = ln(5) - ln(2t). So, the equation is:

t = ln(10t) / [ln(5) - ln(2t)]

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator:

t * [ln(5) - ln(2t)] = ln(10t)

Let me expand the left side:

t * ln(5) - t * ln(2t) = ln(10t)

I can write ln(2t) as ln(2) + ln(t), so:

t * ln(5) - t * [ln(2) + ln(t)] = ln(10t)

Simplify the left side:

t * ln(5) - t * ln(2) - t * ln(t) = ln(10t)

Factor out t:

t [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(t)] = ln(10t)

Hmm, this is still quite involved. Maybe I can express ln(10t) as ln(10) + ln(t). So, the equation becomes:

t [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(t)] = ln(10) + ln(t)

Let me denote ln(5) as L5, ln(2) as L2, ln(10) as L10, and ln(t) as Lt for simplicity. Then, the equation is:

t [L5 - L2 - Lt] = L10 + Lt

Let me rearrange this:

t [L5 - L2 - Lt] - Lt = L10

Factor Lt:

t [L5 - L2 - Lt] - Lt = L10

Wait, maybe I should expand the left side:

t * L5 - t * L2 - t * Lt - Lt = L10

So, grouping terms:

t * L5 - t * L2 - Lt(t + 1) = L10

Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me go back to the original equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I can express log_x(y) as 1 / log_y(x), so let me denote log_y(x) as a, so log_x(y) is 1/a.

Then, equation 1 becomes x * (1/a) = 10, so x = 10a.

Equation 2 becomes 4y * a = 10, so y = 10 / (4a) = 5 / (2a).

So, now I have x = 10a and y = 5/(2a). Now, since a = log_y(x), let's substitute x and y in terms of a into this equation.

So, a = log_y(x) = log_{5/(2a)}(10a)

Hmm, maybe I can write this logarithm in terms of natural logs:

a = ln(10a) / ln(5/(2a))

Which is the same as:

a * ln(5/(2a)) = ln(10a)

Let me compute ln(5/(2a)):

ln(5/(2a)) = ln(5) - ln(2a) = ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(a)

So, substituting back:

a [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(a)] = ln(10) + ln(a)

Let me distribute the a:

a * ln(5) - a * ln(2) - a * ln(a) = ln(10) + ln(a)

Bring all terms to one side:

a * ln(5) - a * ln(2) - a * ln(a) - ln(10) - ln(a) = 0

Factor terms with a:

a [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(a)] - ln(10) - ln(a) = 0

Hmm, this seems similar to where I was before. Maybe I can factor out ln(a):

a [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(a)] - ln(10) - ln(a) = 0

Let me factor out ln(a):

a [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(a)] - ln(a) - ln(10) = 0

Wait, maybe I can factor ln(a) from the first and third terms:

a [ln(5) - ln(2) - ln(a)] - ln(a) - ln(10) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can let’s set u = ln(a). Then, a = e^u.

So, substituting u into the equation:

e^u [ln(5) - ln(2) - u] - u - ln(10) = 0

Let me compute ln(5) - ln(2) - u:

ln(5/2) - u

So, the equation becomes:

e^u [ln(5/2) - u] - u - ln(10) = 0

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in terms of u, which might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I need to find a numerical solution or see if there's a substitution that can make it easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution for t = a, but I don't see an obvious way. Let me think if there's another approach.

Wait, maybe I can express everything in terms of x and y. Let me recall that a = log_y(x), so x = y^a. Also, from equation 1, x = 10a, so y^a = 10a.

Similarly, from equation 2, y = 5/(2a), so substituting into y^a = 10a:

(5/(2a))^a = 10a

So, (5/(2a))^a = 10a

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of a. Let me write it as:

(5/(2a))^a = 10a

This seems similar to the equation I had before. Maybe I can take natural logs on both sides:

ln[(5/(2a))^a] = ln(10a)

Which simplifies to:

a * ln(5/(2a)) = ln(10) + ln(a)

Wait, that's the same equation I had earlier. So, I'm going in circles here.

Maybe I can try plugging in some values for a to see if I can find a solution. Let me try a = 2.

If a = 2, then:

Left side: 2 * ln(5/(2*2)) = 2 * ln(5/4) ≈ 2 * 0.223 ≈ 0.446

Right side: ln(10) + ln(2) ≈ 2.302 + 0.693 ≈ 3.0

Not equal. So, a=2 is too big.

How about a=1?

Left side: 1 * ln(5/2) ≈ 0.916

Right side: ln(10) + ln(1) ≈ 2.302 + 0 ≈ 2.302

Not equal.

a=0.5:

Left side: 0.5 * ln(5/(2*0.5)) = 0.5 * ln(5/1) = 0.5 * ln(5) ≈ 0.5 * 1.609 ≈ 0.804

Right side: ln(10) + ln(0.5) ≈ 2.302 - 0.693 ≈ 1.609

Still not equal.

a=0.2:

Left side: 0.2 * ln(5/(2*0.2)) = 0.2 * ln(5/0.4) = 0.2 * ln(12.5) ≈ 0.2 * 2.525 ≈ 0.505

Right side: ln(10) + ln(0.2) ≈ 2.302 - 1.609 ≈ 0.693

Closer, but not equal.

a=0.1:

Left side: 0.1 * ln(5/(2*0.1)) = 0.1 * ln(5/0.2) = 0.1 * ln(25) ≈ 0.1 * 3.219 ≈ 0.3219

Right side: ln(10) + ln(0.1) ≈ 2.302 - 2.302 ≈ 0

Not equal.

Hmm, seems like a is between 0.1 and 0.2.

Wait, let me try a=0.15:

Left side: 0.15 * ln(5/(2*0.15)) = 0.15 * ln(5/0.3) ≈ 0.15 * ln(16.6667) ≈ 0.15 * 2.813 ≈ 0.422

Right side: ln(10) + ln(0.15) ≈ 2.302 - 1.897 ≈ 0.405

Close, but not equal.

a=0.14:

Left side: 0.14 * ln(5/(2*0.14)) = 0.14 * ln(5/0.28) ≈ 0.14 * ln(17.857) ≈ 0.14 * 2.883 ≈ 0.404

Right side: ln(10) + ln(0.14) ≈ 2.302 - 1.946 ≈ 0.356

Hmm, left side is 0.404, right side is 0.356. So, left side is bigger.

a=0.13:

Left side: 0.13 * ln(5/(2*0.13)) = 0.13 * ln(5/0.26) ≈ 0.13 * ln(19.23) ≈ 0.13 * 2.958 ≈ 0.385

Right side: ln(10) + ln(0.13) ≈ 2.302 - 2.314 ≈ -0.012

Wait, that's negative. So, left side is 0.385, right side is -0.012. Not equal.

Wait, but when a=0.13, the right side is negative, but left side is positive. So, maybe a is between 0.13 and 0.14.

Wait, but when a=0.13, right side is negative, left side is positive. When a=0.14, right side is 0.356, left side is 0.404. So, somewhere between 0.13 and 0.14, the left side crosses the right side.

Wait, but when a=0.13, left side is 0.385, right side is -0.012. So, left side is greater. At a=0.14, left side is 0.404,","[0.404000000000000, '0.404']",25,"[25, '25']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that when Dženija selects 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \), the following two conditions are met:

1. No two of the selected numbers are consecutive.
2. If all four numbers are selected, then any three of them are also non-consecutive.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 distinct numbers from 10, which is given by the combination formula:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

Next, we need to find the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that no two are consecutive. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the concept of ""stars and bars."" We can transform the problem by considering the 4 chosen numbers as \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \) where \( 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 \leq 10 \). To ensure no two are consecutive, we can define new variables \( b_1 = a_1 \), \( b_2 = a_2 - 1 \), \( b_3 = a_3 - 2 \), and \( b_4 = a_4 - 3 \). This transformation ensures that \( b_1 < b_2 < b_3 < b_4 \) and \( b_4 \leq 7 \) (since \( a_4 \leq 10 \)). The number of ways to choose such \( b \) values is:
\[
\binom{10 - 4 + 1}{4} = \binom{7}{4} = 35
\]

However, this count includes cases where all four numbers are consecutive. We need to subtract these cases. The number of ways to choose 4 consecutive numbers from 10 is 7 (i.e., \{1,2,3,4\}, \{2,3,4,5\}, ..., \{7,8,9,10\}). Therefore, the number of valid selections with no two consecutive numbers is:
\[
35 - 7 = 28
\]

Now, we need to ensure that if all four numbers are selected, then any three of them are also non-consecutive. This means that the four numbers must be such that no three are consecutive. However, since we already ensured that no two are consecutive, any three will automatically be non-consecutive. Therefore, the number of valid selections is still 28.

Finally, the probability is the ratio of valid selections to the total number of selections:
\[
\frac{28}{210} = \frac{2}{15}
\]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{2}{15} \), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \( 2 + 15 = 17 \).

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two parallelograms, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are all on the same line, meaning they are colinear as well. I need to find the length of CE, given that BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184.

First, let me try to visualize this. I imagine two parallelograms, ABCD and EFGH. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, AB is equal to CD, and AD is equal to BC. Similarly, in EFGH, EF is equal to GH, and FG is equal to EH.

Given that BC = 16, so AD must also be 16 because it's a parallelogram. AB is 107, so CD is also 107. FG is 17, so EH is 17. EF is 184, so GH is 184.

Now, the key part is that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. Also, A, D, H, G are collinear, meaning they lie on another straight line.

I think I need to draw a diagram to understand this better. Let me sketch parallelogram ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. Then, parallelogram EFGH with EF = 184 and FG = 17. Points D, E, C, F are on a line, so that line must pass through D and F, which are vertices of the two parallelograms. Similarly, points A, D, H, G are on another line.

Wait, so the line through D, E, C, F is one line, and the line through A, D, H, G is another line. These two lines must intersect at point D, since D is common to both. So, point D is the intersection of these two lines.

Let me denote the line D-E-C-F as line l, and the line A-D-H-G as line m. They intersect at D, so D is a common point.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, sides AB and CD are both 107, and sides BC and AD are both 16. Similarly, in EFGH, sides EF and GH are 184, and sides FG and EH are 17.

I think I need to use coordinate geometry here. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's assume they lie along the x-axis for simplicity. So, point D is at (0,0), E is at (e,0), C is at (c,0), and F is at (f,0). But wait, since D, E, C, F are collinear, they lie on the same straight line, which is the x-axis in my coordinate system.

Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, point A must be somewhere above D, and point B must be somewhere above C. Similarly, in EFGH, point E is connected to F and G, so E is connected to F and G, which are on the x-axis.

Wait, but in the problem, it says A, D, H, G are collinear. So, point A is connected to D and H, and G is connected to D and H. So, points A, D, H, G lie on another line, which is line m.

Since D is at (0,0), and points A, D, H, G are on line m, which is different from line l (the x-axis). So, line m is another straight line passing through D, E, H, and G.

So, let me try to assign coordinates accordingly.

Let me denote point D as (0,0). Since line l is the x-axis, points E, C, F are on the x-axis. Let me denote point E as (e,0), point C as (c,0), and point F as (f,0). Similarly, points A, D, H, G are on line m, which is another straight line passing through D.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB is equal to vector DC. Vector DC is from D(0,0) to C(c,0), which is (c,0). So, vector AB should also be (c,0). But AB is given as 107, so the length of AB is 107. Since AB is a side of the parallelogram, it's a vector from A to B. If I consider point A as (x,y), then point B would be (x + c, y). The length AB is 107, so sqrt((c)^2 + 0^2) = c = 107. So, c = 107.

Wait, that's a key point. Since vector DC is (c,0), and vector AB is also (c,0), so the length of DC is c, which is equal to AB, which is 107. Therefore, c = 107. So, point C is at (107,0), and point D is at (0,0). Therefore, point E is at (e,0), point F is at (f,0), and point C is at (107,0).

Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, point A must be somewhere above D, and point B must be above C. Let me denote point A as (a,b) and point B as (a + 107, b). Since AB is 107, the distance between A and B is 107, which is consistent.

Similarly, in parallelogram EFGH, points E, F, G, H are connected. Since E is at (e,0), F is at (f,0), and FG is 17, so the length of FG is 17. Since FG is a side of the parallelogram, it's equal to EH. So, EH is 17. Therefore, point H is at (e + 17,0) or something? Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, in EFGH, sides EF and GH are equal, and sides FG and EH are equal.

Given that EF is 184, so GH is 184. So, if E is at (e,0), then point G is at (e + 184,0). Similarly, point H is at (f + 184,0). Wait, but point F is at (f,0), so point G is connected to F, so FG is 17, so the distance from F to G is 17. So, point G is at (f + 17,0). But in a parallelogram, GH is equal to EF, which is 184. So, GH is 184, so the distance from G to H is 184. So, point H is at (f + 17 + 184,0) = (f + 201,0). Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. In parallelogram EFGH, sides EF and GH are equal and parallel, and sides FG and EH are equal and parallel. So, if EF is 184, then GH is 184. Similarly, FG is 17, so EH is 17.

So, starting from point E(e,0), moving to F(f,0), then to G, then to H, and back to E. So, vector EF is (f - e, 0). Vector FG is (g_x - f, g_y - 0). Vector GH is (h_x - g_x, h_y - g_y). Vector HE is (e - h_x, 0 - h_y).

Since it's a parallelogram, vector EF should equal vector GH, and vector FG should equal vector HE.

So, vector EF = (f - e, 0). Vector GH = (h_x - g_x, h_y - g_y). So, for them to be equal, we must have:

h_x - g_x = f - e

h_y - g_y = 0

Similarly, vector FG = (g_x - f, g_y). Vector HE = (e - h_x, -h_y). So,

g_x - f = e - h_x

g_y = -h_y

So, from vector FG = HE, we have g_x - f = e - h_x and g_y = -h_y.

From vector EF = GH, we have h_x - g_x = f - e and h_y - g_y = 0.

So, from vector EF = GH:

h_x - g_x = f - e

h_y - g_y = 0

From vector FG = HE:

g_x - f = e - h_x

g_y = -h_y

Let me substitute h_x from the first equation into the second equation.

From h_x - g_x = f - e, we have h_x = f - e + g_x.

Substitute into g_x - f = e - h_x:

g_x - f = e - (f - e + g_x)

Simplify the right side:

e - f + e - g_x = 2e - f - g_x

So, equation becomes:

g_x - f = 2e - f - g_x

Bring all terms to left side:

g_x - f - 2e + f + g_x = 0

Simplify:

2g_x - 2e = 0

Divide both sides by 2:

g_x - e = 0 => g_x = e

So, g_x = e.

Then, from h_x = f - e + g_x = f - e + e = f.

So, h_x = f.

From vector FG = HE:

g_x - f = e - h_x => e - f = e - f, which is consistent.

And g_y = -h_y.

So, point G is at (e, g_y), and point H is at (f, -g_y).

So, in parallelogram EFGH, points are E(e,0), F(f,0), G(e, g_y), H(f, -g_y).

Now, since points A, D, H, G are colinear, which is line m. So, points A(a,b), D(0,0), H(f, -g_y), G(e, -g_y) lie on the same line.

So, the line m passes through (a,b), (0,0), (f, -g_y), and (e, -g_y).

Since these points are colinear, the slope between (0,0) and (f, -g_y) should be equal to the slope between (0,0) and (e, -g_y). Let's compute the slope.

Slope between (0,0) and (f, -g_y) is (-g_y - 0)/(f - 0) = -g_y / f.

Slope between (0,0) and (e, -g_y) is (-g_y - 0)/(e - 0) = -g_y / e.

Since both slopes must be equal, we have:

-g_y / f = -g_y / e

Assuming g_y ≠ 0 (otherwise, the parallelogram would be degenerate), we can divide both sides by -g_y:

1/f = 1/e => e = f.

So, e = f.

Therefore, points E and F are at the same x-coordinate, which makes sense because they are both on line l (the x-axis). So, E is at (e,0) and F is at (e,0). Wait, but that would mean E and F are the same point, which can't be because they are distinct vertices of the parallelogram.

Wait, that's a problem. If e = f, then points E and F coincide, which is impossible. So, perhaps my assumption that g_y ≠ 0 is incorrect. Maybe g_y = 0, but then the parallelogram would be degenerate as well.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that A, D, H, G are colinear, so if g_y = 0, then points G and H would be on the x-axis as well, making the parallelogram degenerate. So, that can't be.

Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach is flawed. Let me try a different method.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, and EFGH is another parallelogram, and points D, E, C, F are colinear, and points A, D, H, G are colinear.

Let me consider the coordinates again. Let me place point D at (0,0). Since D, E, C, F are colinear, let me assume they lie on the x-axis. So, point D is (0,0), E is (e,0), C is (c,0), and F is (f,0). Since ABCD is a parallelogram, point A must be somewhere above D, and point B must be above C.

Similarly, in parallelogram EFGH, points E, F, G, H are connected. Since E is at (e,0), F is at (f,0), and FG is 17, so the distance from F to G is 17. So, point G is at (f + 17,0) or (f - 17,0). But since EFGH is a parallelogram, the vector from F to G should be equal to the vector from E to H.

Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, vector EF is equal to vector GH, and vector FG is equal to vector HE.

So, vector EF is (f - e, 0). So, vector GH is also (f - e, 0). So, point G is at (f + (f - e), 0) = (2f - e, 0). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, in a parallelogram, if E is connected to F, then F is connected to G, G is connected to H, and H is connected to E. So, vector EF is (f - e, 0). So, vector GH should be equal to vector EF, which is (f - e, 0). So, if G is at (g_x, g_y), then H is at (g_x + (f - e), g_y). But point H is also connected to E, so vector HE should be equal to vector FG.

Vector FG is (f - e,","[0, '0).']",104,"[104, '104']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the minimum real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, if \(|z| = 4\), then \(z\) can be written in the form \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). That might be useful because it allows me to express \(z\) in terms of its magnitude and angle, which could simplify the expression.

So, let me write \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\) because the reciprocal of \(e^{i\theta}\) is \(e^{-i\theta}\).

Now, substituting \(z\) into the expression:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \((75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta}\)

Let me compute \(75 + 117i\) multiplied by 4:

\(75 \times 4 = 300\)

\(117 \times 4 = 468\)

So, the first term becomes \(300 + 468i\) multiplied by \(e^{i\theta}\). Similarly, the second term is \((96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Compute \(96 + 144i\) multiplied by \(\frac{1}{4}\):

\(96 \div 4 = 24\)

\(144 \div 4 = 36\)

So, the second term becomes \(24 + 36i\) multiplied by \(e^{-i\theta}\).

Now, let me express \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) in terms of cosine and sine:

\(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\)

\(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\)

So, substituting back into the expression:

First term: \((300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\)

Second term: \((24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)\)

Now, I need to multiply these out.

Let me compute the first term:

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this simplifies to:

\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
\]

Combine like terms:

Real parts: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)

Imaginary parts: \(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta\) multiplied by \(i\)

Similarly, compute the second term:

\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta
\]

Again, \(i^2 = -1\), so:

\[
24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]

Combine like terms:

Real parts: \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Imaginary parts: \(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta\) multiplied by \(i\)

Now, let's add the two results together:

Real parts:

\(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Imaginary parts:

\(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta\)

Simplify the real parts:

Combine \(300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta = 324\cos\theta\)

Combine \(-468\sin\theta + 36\sin\theta = -432\sin\theta\)

So, real part is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\)

Simplify the imaginary parts:

Combine \(300\sin\theta - 24\sin\theta = 276\sin\theta\)

Combine \(468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta = 504\cos\theta\)

So, imaginary part is \(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta\)

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)
\]

Now, the problem asks for the minimum real part of this expression. So, the real part is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). I need to find the minimum value of this expression as \(\theta\) varies.

Hmm, okay. So, I have a function \(f(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). I need to find its minimum value.

I remember that expressions of the form \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) can be rewritten as \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\) or \(R\sin(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). The minimum value of such a function is \(-R\), and the maximum is \(R\).

So, let me compute \(R\) for \(f(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\).

Compute \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\)

First, compute \(324^2\):

324 * 324: Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, \(R = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624}\)

Compute 104,976 + 186,624:

104,976 + 186,624: Let's add 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000; 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,500. So total is 291,500.

Wait, let me check that:

104,976 + 186,624:

104,976 + 186,624:

Start with 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000

4,976 + 6,624 = 11,500

So, total is 280,000 + 11,500 = 291,500.

So, \(R = \sqrt{291,500}\).

Let me compute that.

First, note that 291,500 = 100 * 2,915.

So, \(\sqrt{291,500} = 10\sqrt{2,915}\).

Now, let's see if 2,915 can be simplified.

Divide 2,915 by 5: 2,915 ÷ 5 = 583.

583 is a prime number? Let me check: 583 ÷ 11 = 53, because 11*53 = 583. So, 2,915 = 5 * 11 * 53.

So, \(\sqrt{2,915} = \sqrt{5 * 11 * 53}\), which doesn't simplify further.

So, \(R = 10\sqrt{2,915}\). Let me compute this approximately to see what it is.

First, compute \(\sqrt{2,915}\):

I know that 54^2 = 2,916. Oh, that's very close. 54^2 = 2,916, so \(\sqrt{2,915} = \sqrt{54^2 - 1} \approx 54 - \frac{1}{2*54}\) using the approximation \(\sqrt{n^2 - 1} \approx n - \frac{1}{2n}\) for large n.

So, approximately, \(\sqrt{2,915} \approx 54 - \frac{1}{108} \approx 54 - 0.009259 \approx 53.9907\).

Therefore, \(R \approx 10 * 53.9907 \approx 539.907\).

So, \(R \approx 539.907\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(f(\theta)\) is approximately 539.907, and the minimum is approximately -539.907.

But since the problem asks for the minimum real part, it's approximately -539.907. But I need to express this exactly, not approximately.

Wait, but maybe I can write it in exact terms. Since \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\), which is \(\sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,500}\). So, \(R = \sqrt{291,500}\). Let me factor 291,500:

291,500 = 100 * 2,915, as before.

And 2,915 = 5 * 583, and 583 = 11 * 53, so 291,500 = 100 * 5 * 11 * 53.

So, \(R = \sqrt{100 * 5 * 11 * 53} = 10\sqrt{5 * 11 * 53}\).

So, \(R = 10\sqrt{2915}\). Therefore, the minimum real part is \(-10\sqrt{2915}\).

But let me check if I can simplify \(\sqrt{2915}\) further. Wait, 2915 divided by 5 is 583, which is 11*53, as before. So, no, it can't be simplified further.

Therefore, the minimum real part is \(-10\sqrt{2915}\).

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 2915 is 5*11*53, which is correct, and 10*sqrt(2915) is approximately 539.907, which is about 540. So, the minimum real part is approximately -540.

But let me see if I can write this in a more simplified radical form or perhaps factor it differently.

Wait, 2915 is 5*11*53, which are all primes, so I don't think it can be simplified further. So, the exact value is \(-10\sqrt{2915}\).

But let me check if I made a mistake in computing \(R\). Let me recalculate \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2}\).

324 squared: 324*324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976. Correct.

432 squared: 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, 160,000 +","[160000, '160000']",540,"[540, '540']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of BD² among all possible rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at a point, and I need to find the least possible value of BD², which would be the maximum value when considering the opposite.

First, I should recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, actually, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm that.

Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that means the point where the diagonals intersect is the midpoint of both diagonals and the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if the diagonals intersect at point P, then AP = PC and BP = PD, and the diagonals are perpendicular.

Given that, the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis.

Now, the rhombus is inscribed in this hyperbola, meaning all four vertices lie on the hyperbola. The diagonals intersect at a point, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, their intersection point is the midpoint of both AC and BD.

Let me denote the intersection point as O. So, O is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. Therefore, if I can find the coordinates of O, I can find the coordinates of A, B, C, D.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the slopes of AC and BD should be negative reciprocals of each other.

Let me denote the coordinates of O as (h, k). Then, since O is the midpoint of AC, if A is (x1, y1), then C is (2h - x1, 2k - y1). Similarly, if B is (x2, y2), then D is (2h - x2, 2k - y2).

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, for point A: (x1)²/20 - (y1)²/24 = 1.

Similarly, for point B: (x2)²/20 - (y2)²/24 = 1.

But since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. The slope of AC is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1), and the slope of BD is (y1 - y2)/(x1 - x2) = -(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So, their product is -1, which confirms that they are perpendicular.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But maybe it's easier to use vectors or coordinate geometry to express the conditions.

Alternatively, since the diagonals intersect at O, and the rhombus is symmetric with respect to O, perhaps I can parameterize the points A, B, C, D in terms of vectors from O.

Let me consider that. Let me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, OD. Since O is the midpoint, OA = -OC and OB = -OD.

But in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so OA and OB are perpendicular. Wait, no, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular. So, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

But AC is from A to C, which is 2h - x1, 2k - y1 minus x1, y1, so the vector AC is (2h - 2x1, 2k - 2y1). Similarly, BD is (2h - 2x2, 2k - 2y2).

So, the vectors AC and BD are (2(h - x1), 2(k - y1)) and (2(h - x2), 2(k - y2)).

Since AC and BD are perpendicular, their dot product is zero:

[2(h - x1)][2(h - x2)] + [2(k - y1)][2(k - y2)] = 0

Simplify:

4[(h - x1)(h - x2) + (k - y1)(k - y2)] = 0

So,

(h - x1)(h - x2) + (k - y1)(k - y2) = 0

But since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have:

x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1

x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1

Also, since O is the midpoint, we have:

x1 + x2 = 2h

y1 + y2 = 2k

So, x2 = 2h - x1

y2 = 2k - y1

Substituting these into the equation:

(h - x1)(h - (2h - x1)) + (k - y1)(k - (2k - y1)) = 0

Simplify:

(h - x1)(h - 2h + x1) + (k - y1)(k - 2k + y1) = 0

Which is:

(h - x1)(-h + x1) + (k - y1)(-k + y1) = 0

Which is:

-(h - x1)² - (k - y1)² = 0

So,

(h - x1)² + (k - y1)² = 0

Wait, that can't be right because the sum of squares is zero only if each term is zero. So,

h - x1 = 0 and k - y1 = 0

Therefore, h = x1 and k = y1

But h and k are the coordinates of point O, which is the midpoint of AC. So, if h = x1 and k = y1, then point O is (x1, y1), which is point A. But that can't be because O is the midpoint of AC, so O can't coincide with A unless AC is a degenerate line, which it's not.

Hmm, that suggests a contradiction. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me go back.

We have:

(h - x1)(h - x2) + (k - y1)(k - y2) = 0

But x2 = 2h - x1 and y2 = 2k - y1

So,

(h - x1)(h - (2h - x1)) + (k - y1)(k - (2k - y1)) = 0

Simplify:

(h - x1)(-h + x1) + (k - y1)(-k + y1) = 0

Which is:

-(h - x1)² - (k - y1)² = 0

So,

-(h - x1)² - (k - y1)² = 0

Which implies that (h - x1)² + (k - y1)² = 0

Which again implies h = x1 and k = y1.

But that would mean O is point A, which is not possible because O is the midpoint of AC, so O can't be A unless AC is a degenerate line, which it's not.

So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1.

Let me denote the slope of AC as m, then the slope of BD is -1/m.

But since O is the midpoint, the coordinates of O can be expressed in terms of the coordinates of A and C.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.

Let me recall that for hyperbolas, parametric equations can be written as x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where a and b are constants.

In this case, a² = 20, so a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b² = 24, so b = 2*sqrt(6).

So, parametric coordinates for the hyperbola are (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ).

So, let me denote point A as (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ). Then, since O is the midpoint of AC, point C would be (2h - 2√5 secθ, 2k - 2√6 tanθ). But since O is the midpoint, h = (x_A + x_C)/2, so x_C = 2h - x_A, similarly y_C = 2k - y_A.

But since the diagonals are perpendicular, the slope of AC times the slope of BD is -1.

Slope of AC is (y_C - y_A)/(x_C - x_A) = (2k - 2√6 tanθ - 2√6 tanθ)/(2h - 2√5 secθ - 2√5 secθ) = (2k - 4√6 tanθ)/(2h - 4√5 secθ) = (k - 2√6 tanθ)/(h - 2√5 secθ)

Similarly, slope of BD is (y_D - y_B)/(x_D - x_B) = (2k - 2√6 tanθ - 2√6 tanθ)/(2h - 2√5 secθ - 2√5 secθ) = same as slope of AC, but with y's subtracted.

Wait, no, actually, slope of BD is (y_D - y_B)/(x_D - x_B). Since D is (2h - x_C, 2k - y_C), which is (2h - (2h - x_A), 2k - (2k - y_A)) = (x_A, y_A). Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, if A is (x_A, y_A), then C is (2h - x_A, 2k - y_A). Then, D is (2h - x_C, 2k - y_C) = (2h - (2h - x_A), 2k - (2k - y_A)) = (x_A, y_A). So, D is (x_A, y_A), which is point A. That can't be, because then BD would be BA, which is a side, not a diagonal.

Wait, that suggests that if O is the midpoint, then D is A, which is not possible because then BD would be BA, which is a side, not a diagonal. So, perhaps my parametrization is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the diagonals are AC and BD, with O as their midpoint. So, if A is (x1, y1), then C is (2h - x1, 2k - y1). Similarly, if B is (x2, y2), then D is (2h - x2, 2k - y2). So, in this case, D is not necessarily equal to A, but another point.

So, in that case, the diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at O. So, O is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So, in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD, with A and C being opposite vertices, and B and D being the other pair.

So, in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD, with midpoints at O.

So, the diagonals are AC and BD, with O as their midpoint.

So, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1.

So, slope of AC is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1), and slope of BD is (y1 - y2)/(x1 - x2) = -(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So, their product is -1, which is consistent with them being perpendicular.

So, the diagonals are perpendicular, and their midpoints are at O.

So, perhaps I can parametrize points A and C such that O is the midpoint, and similarly for B and D.

But since the rhombus is determined by points A, B, C, D, with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at O, and O being the midpoint.

So, perhaps I can parametrize points A and C as (x, y) and (2h - x, 2k - y), and similarly for B and D.

But since all four points lie on the hyperbola, I can write equations for each.

So, for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

For point C: (2h - x)²/20 - (2k - y)²/24 = 1

Similarly, for point B: (x', y')²/20 - (y')²/24 = 1

For point D: (2h - x')²/20 - (2k - y')²/24 = 1

But since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal in length.

So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, etc.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at O, the rhombus can be considered as a parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals.

In such a case, the area of the rhombus is (AC * BD)/2.

But we need to find BD², so perhaps we can express BD in terms of AC or vice versa.

But since the diagonals are perpendicular, the area is (AC * BD)/2.

But I don't know the area, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the property that in a rhombus, the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to four times the sum of the squares of the sides.

But since all sides are equal, let me denote the side length as s.

Then, 4s² = AC² + BD²

But I don't know s, so maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, but perhaps I can express BD² in terms of AC².

But I need to find the maximum value of BD², so maybe I can express BD² in terms of AC² and then find the minimum of BD².

"Alright, so I've got this problem here about Aimevilas iedzīvotāji. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The problem states that there are 195 iedzīvotāji in total. Out of these, 367 have dimastas gredzenas, 562 have golfa nūju komplekts, and 437 have dārza lāpsta. Additionally, there are 234 iedzīvotāji who have dimastas gredzenas un golfa nūju. The question is asking for the number of iedzīvotāji who have dimastas gredzenas, golfa nūju, dārza lāpsta, and also have their own separate status—meaning they have all three.

Okay, so I think this is a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall that principle. It's used to find the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets and then subtracting the sizes of all possible intersections, and so on.

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- Let G be the set of iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas.
- Let N be the set with golfa nūju.
- Let D be the set with dārza lāpsta.

We are given:
- |G| = 367
- |N| = 562
- |D| = 437
- |G ∩ N| = 234

We need to find the number of iedzīvotāji who have all three, which is |G ∩ N ∩ D|.

Wait, but the problem also mentions that there are 437 iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas, 234 with dimastas gredzenas un golfa nūju, and 437 with dārza lāpsta. Hmm, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says: ""ir 437 iedzīvotāji, kuriem pieder tieši divas no šīm lietām, un 234 iedzīvotāji, kuriem pieder tieši trīs no šīm lietām."" So, maybe it's saying that 437 have dimastas gredzenas, and 234 have dimastas gredzenas un golfa nūju. So, perhaps the 234 is the intersection of G and N, and the 437 is the total in G.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of iedzīvotāji who have dimastas gredzenas, golfa nūju, dārza lāpsta, and also have their own separate status. So, I think I need to find the number of iedzīvotāji who have all three, which is |G ∩ N ∩ D|.

But I'm a bit confused because the problem mentions 437 iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas, and 234 with dimastas gredzenas un golfa nūju. Maybe I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.

Let me recall the formula for three sets:
|G ∪ N ∪ D| = |G| + |N| + |D| - |G ∩ N| - |G ∩ D| - |N ∩ D| + |G ∩ N ∩ D|

But wait, the problem doesn't give me |G ∪ N ∪ D|, so maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of iedzīvotāji who have all three is equal to the number who have dimastas gredzenas and golfa nūju minus those who have dimastas gredzenas, golfa nūju, and dārza lāpsta. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the 234 iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas and golfa nūju are part of the 437 iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas. So, perhaps the 234 is the intersection of G and N, and the 437 is the total in G, so the number of iedzīvotāji in G but not in N is 367 - 234 = 133.

Similarly, the number of iedzīvotāji in G and D but not in N would be |G ∩ D| - |G ∩ N ∩ D|, but I don't know |G ∩ D| yet.

Wait, maybe I can find |G ∩ D| using the total number of iedzīvotāji. But I don't have the total of G ∪ N ∪ D, so perhaps I need to make an assumption or find another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. It says there are 195 iedzīvotāji in total. Out of these, 367 have dimastas gredzenas, 562 have golfa nūju, 437 have dārza lāpsta. But wait, 367 + 562 + 437 is way more than 195, so there must be overlaps.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the number of iedzīvotāji who have all three: dimastas gredzenas, golfa nūju, and dārza lāpsta. So, that's |G ∩ N ∩ D|.

I know that |G| = 367, |N| = 562, |D| = 437, and |G ∩ N| = 234. I need to find |G ∩ N ∩ D|.

But without more information, I can't directly compute this. Maybe I can use the formula for three sets:

|G ∪ N ∪ D| = |G| + |N| + |D| - |G ∩ N| - |G ∩ D| - |N ∩ D| + |G ∩ N ∩ D|

But since I don't know |G ∪ N ∪ D|, I can't proceed directly. Maybe I need to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the 437 iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas include those who also have golfa nūju and dārza lāpsta. So, maybe the number of iedzīvotāji with all three is the number with dimastas gredzenas minus those who don't have golfa nūju or dārza lāpsta.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as the number of iedzīvotāji with all three is equal to the number with dimastas gredzenas and golfa nūju minus those who have dimastas gredzenas, golfa nūju, and dārza lāpsta. But I don't know the latter.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it as a Venn diagram problem. There are three circles for G, N, and D. The total number of iedzīvotāji is 195, but the sum of |G| + |N| + |D| is 367 + 562 + 437 = 1366, which is way more than 195, so there must be overlaps.

But the problem is asking for the number of iedzīvotāji who have all three, which is |G ∩ N ∩ D|. I know |G ∩ N| = 234, but I don't know |G ∩ D| or |N ∩ D|.

Wait, maybe I can find |G ∩ D| and |N ∩ D| using the total number of iedzīvotāji. But I don't have the total of G ∪ N ∪ D, so I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem says there are 195 iedzīvotāji in total. So, maybe the sum of |G| + |N| + |D| minus the overlaps equals 195. But I don't know the overlaps.

Wait, let me try to write the equation:

|G| + |N| + |D| - |G ∩ N| - |G ∩ D| - |N ∩ D| + |G ∩ N ∩ D| = Total

But I don't know |G ∩ D| or |N ∩ D|, so I can't solve for |G ∩ N ∩ D|.

Wait, maybe I can make an assumption that the overlaps are as given. For example, |G ∩ N| = 234, which is the number of iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas and golfa nūju. So, perhaps the number of iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas and dārza lāpsta is |G| - |G ∩ N| = 367 - 234 = 133.

Similarly, the number of iedzīvotāji with dimastas gredzenas and dārza lāpsta is 133, and the number with golfa nūju and dārza lāpsta is |D| - |G ∩ D|, but I don't know |G ∩ D|.

Wait, but I don't have enough information to proceed. Maybe I need to make an assumption that the overlaps are as given, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. It says there are 195 iedzīvotāji in total. Out of these, 367 have dimastas gredzenas, 562 have golfa nūju, 437 have dārza lāpsta. But wait, 367 + 562 + 437 = 1366, which is way more than 195, so there must be overlaps.

But the problem is asking for the number of iedzīvotāji who have all three. So, perhaps the number is the intersection of all three sets, which is |G ∩ N ∩ D|.

But without more information, I can't calculate it. Maybe I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as the number of iedzīvotāji with all three is equal to the number with dimastas gredzenas minus those who don't have golfa nūju or dārza lāpsta. But I don't know how many don't have those.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as a system of equations.

Let me denote:

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says that in triangle ABC, the incenter is O and the circumcenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI, and the inradius is 13, while the circumradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me recall some concepts. The incenter O is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is the center of the incircle, which touches all three sides of the triangle. The circumcenter I is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors and is the center of the circumcircle, which passes through all three vertices of the triangle.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that must mean that the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. So, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. That seems important.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me verify that. Yes, I think that's correct. So, plugging in the given values, R is 6 and r is 13. Wait, hold on, that can't be right because R is 6 and r is 13, so R - 2r would be 6 - 26, which is negative. That would make OI² negative, which doesn't make sense. So, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me check that. Yes, I think that's correct. So, OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, plugging in the values, OI² = 6² - 2*6*13 = 36 - 156 = -120. Hmm, that's still negative. That can't be. So, maybe I have the formula wrong.

Wait, no, actually, I think the correct formula is OI² = R(R - 2r). So, if R is 6 and r is 13, then OI² = 6*(6 - 26) = 6*(-20) = -120. Still negative. That doesn't make sense because the square of the distance can't be negative. So, perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, maybe it's OI² = R² - 2Rr, but in this case, since R is 6 and r is 13, it's 36 - 156 = -120, which is negative. That can't be. So, maybe the formula is different. Let me think.

I think the correct formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr, but only when the triangle is acute. If the triangle is obtuse, then OI² becomes negative. So, in this case, since R is 6 and r is 13, which is larger, maybe the triangle is obtuse. Hmm, okay, so maybe the formula still holds, but the distance OI is imaginary, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe I should recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by:

OI² = R² - 2Rr

But if this gives a negative value, that would mean that the incenter and circumcenter are imaginary, which is impossible. So, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe it's OI² = R² - 2Rr cos A, but that's for the distance from the circumradius to the inradius. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius. But since I can't look things up, I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.

Let me place the incenter O at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is along the x-axis, then IA must be along the y-axis. So, point A is somewhere on the y-axis, say at (0, k). Then, the inradius is 13, so the distance from O to A is 13, which is the inradius. So, OA = 13, which is the length from O to A, which is along the y-axis. So, point A is at (0,13).

Wait, but in reality, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to the sides, not necessarily the distance from the incenter to the vertex. So, if O is at (0,0), and A is at (0,13), then the distance OA is 13, which is the inradius. So, that's correct.

Now, the circumradius is 6. The circumradius is the distance from the circumcenter I to any vertex, so if I can find the coordinates of I, then the distance from I to A is 6. Wait, but I is the circumradius, so the distance from I to A is 6, but in reality, the distance from I to A is the length of IA, which is given as perpendicular to OI. Since OI is along the x-axis, IA is along the y-axis, so point A is at (0,13), and point I is somewhere on the x-axis, say at (h,0). Then, the distance from I to A is sqrt((h - 0)^2 + (0 - 13)^2) = sqrt(h² + 169). But this distance is equal to the circumradius, which is 6. So, sqrt(h² + 169) = 6. Squaring both sides, h² + 169 = 36, so h² = 36 - 169 = -133. Again, negative. That can't be. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I got the direction of OI wrong. Maybe OI is not along the x-axis, but in some other direction. Hmm, but I placed O at (0,0) and A at (0,13). So, OI is along the x-axis, and IA is along the y-axis. So, point I is at (h,0), and point A is at (0,13). So, the distance IA is sqrt(h² + 13²) = sqrt(h² + 169). But the circumradius is 6, so sqrt(h² + 169) = 6, which gives h² = -133. That's impossible. So, my coordinate system must be flawed.

Wait, maybe I should place the incenter O at (0,0) and the circumcenter I somewhere else. Let me think. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the line IA is perpendicular to OI. So, if OI is along the x-axis, then IA is along the y-axis. So, point A is somewhere on the y-axis, and point I is somewhere on the x-axis. So, point A is at (0,13), point I is at (h,0). Then, the distance from I to A is sqrt(h² + 13²) = 6. So, h² + 169 = 36, which gives h² = -133. That's impossible. So, maybe my coordinate system is not the best.

Alternatively, maybe I should place point I at (0,0) instead. Let me try that. So, O is at some point (h, k), and I is at (0,0). Then, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector OI is (h, k), and vector IA is (0 - h, 13 - k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero. So, (h)(0 - h) + (k)(13 - k) = 0. So, -h² + 13k - k² = 0. So, h² + k² = 13k.

Also, the distance from I to A is 6, so sqrt((0 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2) = 6, so h² + k² = 36. But from the previous equation, h² + k² = 13k, so 13k = 36, so k = 36/13. Then, h² = 36 - k² = 36 - (1296/169) = (6084 - 1296)/169 = 4788/169. So, h = sqrt(4788/169) = sqrt(4788)/13. Let me compute sqrt(4788). 4788 divided by 4 is 1197, which is 1197. 1197 divided by 3 is 399, which is 3*133, which is 3*7*19. So, sqrt(4788) = sqrt(4*1197) = 2*sqrt(1197). So, h = 2*sqrt(1197)/13. Hmm, that's messy. Maybe I can keep it as h² = 4788/169.

So, now, I have the coordinates of O as (h, k) = (sqrt(4788/169), 36/13). Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I can find another relation.

Also, the inradius is 13, which is the distance from O to the sides. Wait, no, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to the sides, which is 13. So, the distance from O to side BC is 13. Similarly, the distance from O to side AC is 13, and the distance from O to side AB is 13.

But I'm not sure how to use that yet. Maybe I can use the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. Wait, the distance from O to A is sqrt(h² + k²) = sqrt(36) = 6, which is the circumradius. Wait, that's not correct because the distance from O to A is actually the circumradius, which is 6. But in reality, the distance from O to A is sqrt(h² + k²) = sqrt(36) = 6, which is correct. So, that's consistent.

Wait, but in my coordinate system, point A is at (0,13), and point O is at (h, k) = (sqrt(4788/169), 36/13). So, the distance from O to A is sqrt((sqrt(4788/169) - 0)^2 + (36/13 - 13)^2). Let me compute that.

First, 36/13 - 13 = 36/13 - 169/13 = (-133)/13. So, the distance squared is (4788/169) + (17689/169) = (4788 + 17689)/169 = 22477/169. So, sqrt(22477/169) = sqrt(22477)/13. But we know that the distance from O to A is 6, so sqrt(22477)/13 = 6. Therefore, sqrt(22477) = 78. So, 22477 = 78² = 6084. Wait, 78² is 6084, but 22477 is much larger. So, that's a problem. So, my coordinate system is inconsistent.

Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should not place O at (0,0) and A at (0,13). Maybe I should place O at (0,0) and I somewhere else. Let me try that.

So, O is at (0,0), I is at (h, k). The distance from O to I is sqrt(h² + k²). The distance from I to A is 6, and IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector OI is (h, k), and vector IA is (x - h, y - k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero: h(x - h) + k(y - k) = 0.

Also, the distance from I to A is 6, so sqrt((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2) = 6. So, (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 36.

But I don't know the coordinates of A yet. Hmm, maybe I can find another relation.

Wait, the inradius is 13, which is the distance from O to the sides. So, the distance from O to side BC is 13. Similarly, the distance from O to side AC is 13, and the distance from O to side AB is 13.

But without knowing the coordinates of A, B, and C, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by:

OI² = R² - 2Rr

But earlier, I thought this gave a negative value, which is impossible. So, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me check.

Wait, actually, the correct formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, if R is 6 and r is 13, then OI² = 36 - 2*6*13 = 36 - 156 = -120. That's negative, which is impossible. So, that formula must be incorrect.

Wait, no, actually, the correct formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr cos A, but that's for the distance from the circumradius to the inradius. Wait, no, that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. But if that gives a negative value, then the triangle is obtuse. So, maybe the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr, but in this case, since R is 6 and r is 13, OI² is negative, which would mean that the triangle is obtuse. So, maybe the formula is correct, but the distance is imaginary, which is","[13, '13']",468,"[468, '468']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ordered triples of non-negative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that a, b, and c are non-negative integers, so they can be 0 or any positive whole number. The first equation is straightforward: their sum is 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated, involving quadratic terms. Maybe I can find a way to simplify or factor this expression.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared and the other to the first power. Maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me try grouping the terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Hmm, that's interesting. Since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me do that:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So, expanding each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So, I have 300 times the sum of squares minus the sum of cubes equals 6,000,000. Maybe I can express this in terms of the sum of squares and the sum of cubes.

I know that for three variables, there are some identities, but I'm not sure if that will help here. Maybe I can think about symmetric functions or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the case where two variables are equal or something like that.

Wait, another thought: if a, b, c are all equal, then a = b = c = 100, since 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. Let me check if that satisfies the second equation.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b when a = b = c = 100:

Each term is 100² * 100 = 1,000,000. There are six such terms, so 6 * 1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Oh! So, (100, 100, 100) is a solution. That's one solution.

But the question is asking for the number of ordered triples. So, are there other solutions? Or is (100, 100, 100) the only one?

Let me think. Maybe I can consider cases where one of the variables is 0. Suppose c = 0. Then, a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000.

So, ab*300 = 6,000,000 => ab = 20,000. So, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Let me solve for a and b.

We can set up the quadratic equation: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0. Let's compute the discriminant: D = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. So, sqrt(D) = 100.

Thus, the solutions are x = [300 ± 100]/2, which gives x = 200 or x = 100. So, a and b are 200 and 100. Therefore, the ordered triples are (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But since the variables are ordered, these are distinct solutions.

Similarly, if we set b = 0, we get a + c = 300 and ac = 20,000, leading to a = 200, c = 100 or a = 100, c = 200. So, the ordered triples are (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200).

Similarly, if a = 0, then b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000. So, solving x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0, same as before, giving x = 200 or 100. So, the ordered triples are (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200).

So, in total, when one variable is 0, we have 6 ordered triples: (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). So, that's 6 solutions.

But wait, earlier, when all three variables are equal, we had (100, 100, 100). So, that's another solution. So, so far, we have 7 solutions.

But maybe there are more solutions where none of the variables are 0. Let me check.

Suppose none of a, b, c is 0. Then, all of them are positive integers. Let me see if I can find such triples.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, and Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

Wait, but in the second equation, we have a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me see if I can express this in terms of S, Q, and P.

Wait, let's compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

This can be written as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, a + b = 300 - c.

So, substituting, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Which is the same as 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I know that a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2Q.

Similarly, a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.

So, substituting back into the equation:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) - [300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Then, subtract [300³ - 900Q + 3P]:

So, 27,000,000 - 600Q - 300³ + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Compute 300³: 300*300*300 = 27,000,000.

So, substituting:

27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, we have the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

But Q is ab + bc + ca, and P is abc.

So, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can find some relationship here.

Let me denote Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.

So, 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

I need to find positive integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300 and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

This seems tricky, but maybe I can think of this as a cubic equation in terms of one variable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that if a, b, c are all equal, then Q = 3a² and P = a³. Plugging into the equation:

100*(3a²) - a³ = 2,000,000.

So, 300a² - a³ = 2,000,000.

Let me write this as a³ - 300a² + 2,000,000 = 0.

We know that a = 100 is a solution because 100³ - 300*(100)² + 2,000,000 = 1,000,000 - 30,000 + 2,000,000 = 2,000,000. Wait, no, that's 1,000,000 - 30,000 + 2,000,000 = 2,000,000? Wait, 1,000,000 - 30,000 is 970,000, plus 2,000,000 is 2,970,000, which is not zero. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, actually, 100³ is 1,000,000, 300*(100)² is 300*10,000 = 3,000,000. So, 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 0. Oh, right, so 100 is a root.

So, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide a³ - 300a² + 2,000,000 by (a - 100). Using synthetic division:

100 | 1  -300   0    2,000,000
          100  -20,000  -2,000,000
        ---------------------------
          1  -200  -20,000    0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a - 20,000) = 0.

So, the other roots are solutions to a² - 200a - 20,000 = 0.

Compute discriminant: D = 40,000 + 80,000 = 120,000. So, sqrt(120,000) = sqrt(400*300) = 20*sqrt(300) ≈ 20*17.32 ≈ 346.41.

So, a = [200 ± 346.41]/2. So, a ≈ (200 + 346.41)/2 ≈ 273.2","[273.200000000000, '273.2']",601,"[601, '601']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\). Point \(A\) is at \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and point \(B\) is at \(\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). 

Next, we need to determine the equation of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). The slope of the line through \(A\) and \(B\) is calculated as:
\[
m = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form with point \(A\), the equation of the line is:
\[

Simplifying, we get:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

We are looking for a point \(C\) on this line segment \(\overline{AB}\) that is not coinciding with \(A\) or \(B\). Let’s denote the coordinates of \(C\) as \((x, y)\). Since \(C\) lies on \(\overline{AB}\), it must satisfy the equation of the line:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

We need to find the coordinates of \(C\) such that \(OC^2\) is minimized. The distance squared from the origin \(O\) to point \(C\) is given by:
\[
OC^2 = x^2 + y^2
\]
Substituting the expression for \(y\) from the line equation into the distance formula:
\[
OC^2 = x^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2

Expanding the squared term:
\[
\left(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}

Thus, the expression for \(OC^2\) becomes:
\[
OC^2 = x^2 + 3x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4} = 4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(OC^2\), we take the derivative with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}(4x^2 - 3x + \frac{3}{4}) = 8x - 3 = 0
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
8x - 3 = 0 \implies x = \frac{3}{8}
\]

Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{8}\) back into the equation of the line to find \(y\):
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{3}{8}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Therefore, the coordinates of point \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\). Now, we calculate \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{12}{64} = \frac{3}{16}

"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity. Then, I have to return the result modulo 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \(\omega^{13} = 1\). Also, the minimal polynomial for \(\omega\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \(\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1\). That might come in handy later.

Looking at the product, each term is \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Let me try to rewrite it:

\(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\).

Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \(\omega^k\). Let me set \(x = \omega^k\), so the expression becomes \(2 - 2x + x^2\). That factors as \((x - 1)^2 + 1\), right? Because \(x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2\), so adding 1 gives \((x - 1)^2 + 1\). So, each term is \((\omega^k - 1)^2 + 1\).

Wait, is that helpful? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the product over all \(k\) from 0 to 12. Since \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, the exponents \(k\) run through all residues modulo 13 except 0? Wait, no, actually, when \(k=0\), \(\omega^0 = 1\), so the term becomes \(2 - 2(1) + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1\). So, the first term is 1, and the rest of the terms are from \(k=1\) to \(k=12\).

So, the product is 1 multiplied by the product from \(k=1\) to \(k=12\) of \((2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). Maybe I can consider the entire product from \(k=0\) to \(k=12\), which is 13 terms, but since the first term is 1, it's the same as the product from \(k=1\) to \(k=12\).

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all \(k\) from 0 to 12, which is 13 terms, but since \(\omega^0 = 1\), the term is 1, so the product is the same as the product from \(k=1\) to \(k=12\). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, another thought: since \(\omega\) is a root of unity, maybe I can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials or something related to the minimal polynomials. The product might relate to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.

Let me consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^{13} - 1\). Since \(\omega\) is a root of this polynomial, we can factor it as \(P(x) = (x - 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1)\). So, the cyclotomic polynomial is \(\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1\).

But how does that help with the product? Maybe I can relate the product to evaluating \(P(x)\) at certain points or something else.

Wait, let's think about the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). Let me denote each term as \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Let me factor out a 2 from the first two terms: \(2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}\). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can write each term as \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \omega^k) + \omega^{2k}\). Hmm, but that still doesn't seem immediately helpful.

Wait, another idea: perhaps consider the product as \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\). Let me denote \(z = \omega^k\), so each term becomes \(2 - 2z + z^2\). So, the product is \(\prod_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\), where \(z\) runs through all 13th roots of unity except \(z=1\), since when \(k=0\), \(z=1\), but we already saw that term is 1.

Wait, actually, when \(k=0\), \(z = 1\), so the term is 1, so the product is \(\prod_{z \neq 1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\). So, the product is equal to \(\prod_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\) divided by \(z=1\), which is 1. So, it's the same as \(\prod_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\) where \(z\) runs over all 13th roots of unity.

But the product over all roots of a polynomial is related to the constant term of the polynomial. Wait, more precisely, if we have a polynomial \(Q(x) = \prod_{z} (x - z)\), then \(\prod_{z} Q(z)\) is the product over all roots of \(Q(x)\) of \(Q(z)\). But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that \(\prod_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\) is equal to \(\prod_{z} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\), since \(z^2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\). So, the product becomes \(\prod_{z} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\).

But since \(z\) runs over all 13th roots of unity, which are the roots of \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\), so the product \(\prod_{z} (z - a)\) is equal to \(a^{13} - 1\), because the product of \((x - a)\) over all roots \(x\) of \(x^{13} - 1\) is \(a^{13} - 1\). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, actually, the product \(\prod_{z} (z - a)\) where \(z\) are the roots of \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\) is equal to \(\prod_{z} (z - a) = (-1)^{13} \prod_{z} (a - z) = (-1)^{13} \prod_{z} (a - z)\). But \(\prod_{z} (a - z)\) is the value of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) evaluated at \(x = a\), which is \(a^{13} - 1\). So, \(\prod_{z} (z - a) = (-1)^{13} (a^{13} - 1) = -(a^{13} - 1)\).

Therefore, in our case, \(\prod_{z} (z - (1 + i)) = -( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 )\) and similarly \(\prod_{z} (z - (1 - i)) = -( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 )\). Therefore, the product \(\prod_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2) = \prod_{z} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) = [ - ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) ] \times [ - ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) ]\).

Simplifying that, we have:

\[
\prod_{z} (z^2 - 2z + 2) = [ - ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) ] \times [ - ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ) ] = ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) \times ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 )
\]

So, now I need to compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\). Let me recall that \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\) can be expressed in polar form. Since \(1 + i\) has magnitude \(\sqrt{2}\) and angle \(\pi/4\), so \(1 + i = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4}\). Similarly, \(1 - i = \sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4}\).

Therefore, raising them to the 13th power:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{i \cdot 13 \cdot \pi/4} = (2^{1/2})^{13} e^{i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} e^{i \cdot (3\pi + \pi/4)} = 2^{13/2} e^{i \cdot 3\pi/4}
\]

Wait, hold on, \(13 \cdot \pi/4 = 13\pi/4\). Let me compute that modulo \(2\pi\). \(13\pi/4 = 3\pi + \pi/4\), which is equivalent to \(\pi/4\) modulo \(2\pi\), but since it's more than \(2\pi\), we can subtract \(2\pi\) to get it within \(0\) to \(2\pi\). So, \(13\pi/4 - 2\pi = 13\pi/4 - 8\pi/4 = 5\pi/4\). So, \(e^{i \cdot 13\pi/4} = e^{i \cdot 5\pi/4}\).

Similarly, \((1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{-i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} e^{-i \cdot 5\pi/4}\).

So, now, let's compute \((1 + i)^{13} - 1\) and \((1 - i)^{13} - 1\):

First, \( (1 + i)^{13} = 2^{13/2} e^{i \cdot 5\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} \left( \cos(5\pi/4) + i \sin(5\pi/4) \right) = 2^{13/2} \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 2^{13/2} \cdot (-\sqrt{2}/2 - i \sqrt{2}/2) = 2^{13/2} \cdot (-2^{-1/2} - i 2^{-1/2}) = -2^{13/2 - 1/2} - i 2^{13/2 - 1/2} = -2^{6} - i 2^{6} = -64 - 64i\).

Similarly, \((1 - i)^{13} = 2^{13/2} e^{-i \cdot 5\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} \left( \cos(-5\pi/4) + i \sin(-5\pi/4) \right) = 2^{13/2} \left( -\sqrt{2}/2 + i \sqrt{2}/2 \right) = same as above, but with a positive imaginary part. So, \(2^{13/2} \cdot (-\sqrt{2}/2 + i \sqrt{2}/2) = -64 + 64i\).

Therefore, \((1 + i)^{13} - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 = -65 - 64i\), and \((1 - i)^{13} - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 + 64i\).

So, now, the product is:

\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify:

Multiplying \((-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)\) is a difference of squares: \((-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321\). Yes, that's correct.

So, the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is equal to 8321.

But wait, hold on. Earlier, I considered that the product from \(k=0\) to \(12\) is equal to the product from \(z \neq 1\) of \((z^2 - 2z + ","[2, '2']",321,"[321, '321']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \geq 2 \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) which is \( b \)-skaist (meaning \( n \) has two digits in base \( b \)) and the sum of these two digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

First, let's understand what it means for a number to be \( b \)-skaist. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-skaist if it can be expressed as \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \). Since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), \( a \) must be between 1 and \( b-1 \) (inclusive), and \( c \) must be between 0 and \( b-1 \) (inclusive).

Given that the sum of the digits \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \), we can write:
\[
a + c = \sqrt{n}
\]
But since \( n = a \cdot b + c \), substituting this into the equation gives:
\[
a + c = \sqrt{a \cdot b + c}
\]
To eliminate the square root, we square both sides:
\[
(a + c)^2 = a \cdot b + c
\]
Expanding the left side:
\[
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a \cdot b + c
\]
Rearranging terms:
\[
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a \cdot b - c = 0
\]
Simplifying:
\[
a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0
\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \):
\[
a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0
\]
For \( a \) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. The discriminant \( D \) is:
\[
D = (2c - b)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (c^2 - c)
\]
Simplifying:
\[
D = 4c^2 - 4bc + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c
\]
\[
D = -4bc + b^2 + 4c
\]
\[
D = b^2 - 4bc + 4c
\]
\[
D = b^2 - 4c(b - 1)
\]
For \( D \) to be a perfect square, \( b^2 - 4c(b - 1) \) must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square as \( k^2 \):
\[
b^2 - 4c(b - 1) = k^2
\]
Rearranging:
\[
b^2 - k^2 = 4c(b - 1)
\]
Factoring the left side as a difference of squares:
\[
(b - k)(b + k) = 4c(b - 1)
\]
Since \( b \geq 2 \), \( b - 1 \geq 1 \). We need to find integers \( b \) and \( c \) such that this equation holds, with \( a \) and \( c \) being digits in base \( b \) (i.e., \( 1 \leq a \leq b - 1 \) and \( 0 \leq c \leq b - 1 \)).

Let's consider small values of \( b \) and see if we can find corresponding \( c \) and \( a \) that satisfy the conditions.

Starting with \( b = 2 \):
\[
(b - k)(b + k) = 4c(b - 1)
\]
\[
(2 - k)(2 + k) = 4c(1)
\]
\[
4 - k^2 = 4c

Since \( c \) must be an integer, \( 4 - k^2 \) must be divisible by 4. Let's test possible \( k \) values:
- \( k = 0 \): \( 4 - 0 = 4 \), so \( c = 1 \). Then, \( a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \) becomes \( a^2 + (2 - 2)a + (1 - 1) = 0 \), which simplifies to \( a^2 = 0 \). But \( a \) must be at least 1, so this is invalid.
- \( k = 1 \): \( 4 - 1 = 3 \), which is not divisible by 4.
- \( k = 2 \): \( 4 - 4 = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \). Then, \( a^2 + (0 - 2)a + (0 - 0) = 0 \) becomes \( a^2 - 2a = 0 \), so \( a(a - 2) = 0 \). Thus, \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 2 \). But \( a \) must be at least 1 and less than \( b = 2 \), so \( a = 1 \). Then, \( n = 1 \cdot 2 + 0 = 2 \). Check if \( 1 + 0 = \sqrt{2} \). But \( \sqrt{2} \) is not an integer, so this doesn't work.
- \( k = 3 \): \( 4 - 9 = -5 \), which is negative, so \( c \) would be negative, which is invalid.

Thus, \( b = 2 \) doesn't work.

Next, \( b = 3 \):
\[
(3 - k)(3 + k) = 4c(2)
\]
\[
9 - k^2 = 8c
\]
So, \( 9 - k^2 \) must be divisible by 8. Let's test possible \( k \) values:
- \( k = 1 \): \( 9 - 1 = 8 \), so \( c = 1 \). Then, \( a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \) becomes \( a^2 + (2 - 3)a + (1 - 1) = 0 \), which simplifies to \( a^2 - a = 0 \), so \( a(a - 1) = 0 \). Thus, \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 1 \). \( a = 1 \) is valid. Then, \( n = 1 \cdot 3 + 1 = 4 \). Check if \( 1 + 1 = \sqrt{4} \). Indeed, \( 2 = 2 \). So, \( n = 4 \) is a valid \( 3 \)-skaist number. But we need the smallest \( b \geq 2 \), so we should check if there's a smaller \( b \) that works, but we already saw \( b = 2 \) doesn't work. So, \( b = 3 \) is a candidate.

Wait, but the problem says ""mazāko veselo skaitli \( b \geq 2 \)"", which I think means the smallest \( b \) such that there exists a \( b \)-skaist number \( n \) with the given property. So, \( b = 3 \) is a candidate. But let's check if there's a smaller \( b \) that works, but we saw \( b = 2 \) doesn't work. So, \( b = 3 \) is the smallest.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.

Wait, when \( b = 3 \), \( c = 1 \), \( a = 1 \), \( n = 4 \). Then, \( a + c = 2 \), and \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \). So, it works. So, \( b = 3 \) is a solution.

But let me check \( b = 4 \) to see if there's a smaller \( b \) that works, but since \( b = 3 \) works, it's the minimal.

Wait, but the problem says ""mazāko veselo skaitli \( b \geq 2 \)"", which I think is the smallest \( b \) such that there exists a \( b \)-skaist number \( n \) with the given property. So, \( b = 3 \) is the answer.

But let me check \( b = 4 \) just to be thorough.

For \( b = 4 \):
\[
(4 - k)(4 + k) = 4c(3)
\]
\[
16 - k^2 = 12c
\]
So, \( 16 - k^2 \) must be divisible by 12. Let's test possible \( k \) values:
- \( k = 2 \): \( 16 - 4 = 12 \), so \( c = 1 \). Then, \( a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \) becomes \( a^2 + (2 - 4)a + (1 - 1) = 0 \), which simplifies to \( a^2 - 2a = 0 \), so \( a(a - 2) = 0 \). Thus, \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 2 \). \( a = 2 \) is valid. Then, \( n = 2 \cdot 4 + 1 = 9 \). Check if \( 2 + 1 = \sqrt{9} \). Indeed, \( 3 = 3 \). So, \( b = 4 \) also works, but since \( b = 3 \) is smaller, it's the answer.

Wait, but the problem says ""mazāko veselo skaitli \( b \geq 2 \)"", which I think is the smallest \( b \) such that there exists a \( b \)-skaist number \( n \) with the given property. So, \( b = 3 \) is the answer.

But let me check \( b = 5 \) just to be sure.

For \( b = 5 \):
\[
(5 - k)(5 + k) = 4c(4)
\]
\[
25 - k^2 = 16c
\]
So, \( 25 - k^2 \) must be divisible by 16. Let's test possible \( k \) values:
- \( k = 3 \): \( 25 - 9 = 16 \), so \( c = 1 \). Then, \( a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \) becomes \( a^2 + (2 - 5)a + (1 - 1) = 0 \), which simplifies to \( a^2 - 3a = 0 \), so \( a(a - 3) = 0 \). Thus, \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 3 \). \( a = 3 \) is valid. Then, \( n = 3 \cdot 5 + 1 = 16 \). Check if \( 3 + 1 = \sqrt{16} \). Indeed, \( 4 = 4 \). So, \( b = 5 \) also works, but again, \( b = 3 \) is smaller.

Wait, but the problem says ""mazāko veselo skaitli \( b \geq 2 \)"", which I think is the smallest \( b \) such that there exists a \( b \)-skaist number \( n \) with the given property. So, \( b = 3 \) is the answer.

But let me check \( b = 6 \) as well.

For \( b = 6 \):
\[
(6 - k)(6 + k) = 4c(5)
\]
\[
36 - k^2 = 20c
\]
So, \( 36 - k^2 \) must be divisible by 20. Let's test possible \( k \) values:
- \( k = 4 \): \( 36 - 16 = 20 \), so \( c = 1 \). Then, \( a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \) becomes \( a^2 + (2 - 6)a + (1 - 1) = 0 \), which simplifies to \( a^2 - 4a = 0 \), so \( a(a - 4) = 0 \). Thus, \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 4 \). \( a = 4 \) is valid. Then, \( n = 4 \cdot 6 + 1 = 25 \). Check if \( 4 + 1 = \sqrt{25} \). Indeed, \( 5 = 5 \). So, \( b = 6 \) also works, but again, \( b = 3 \) is smaller.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the smallest \( b \geq 2 \), so \( b = 3 \) is the answer.

But let me check \( b = 7 \) just to be thorough.

For \( b = 7 \):
\[
(7 - k)(7 + k) = 4c(6)
\]
\[
49 - k^2 = 24c
\]
So, \( 49 - k^2 \) must be divisible by 24. Let's test possible \( k \) values:
- \( k = 5 \): \( 49 - 25 = 24 \), so \( c = 1 \). Then, \( a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \) becomes \( a^2 + (2 - 7)a + (1 - 1) = 0 \), which simplifies to \( a^2 - 5a = 0 \), so \( a(a - 5) = 0 \). Thus, \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 5 \). \( a = 5 \) is valid. Then, \( n = 5 \cdot 7 + 1 = 36 \). Check if \( 5 + 1 = \sqrt{36} \). Indeed, \( 6 = 6 \). So, \( b","[Eq(b, 7), 'b = 7']",211,"[211, '211']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem about a tiling with a regular 12-sided polygon, or a dodecagon. The task is to find the number of different rectangles that can be formed by connecting vertices of this dodecagon. The rectangles must have their sides either aligned with the sides of the dodecagon or with its diagonals. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all of equal length, and all internal angles equal. The vertices are equally spaced around a circle. So, each vertex is 30 degrees apart because 360 degrees divided by 12 is 30. That might be useful later.

Now, the problem is about tiling with rectangles. So, I need to figure out how many rectangles can be formed by connecting these vertices. The rectangles can be either axis-aligned with the sides of the dodecagon or those that are rotated, using the diagonals of the dodecagon.

Let me visualize the dodecagon. If I label the vertices from 1 to 12 in order around the circle, each vertex is 30 degrees apart. So, vertex 1 is at 0 degrees, vertex 2 at 30 degrees, vertex 3 at 60 degrees, and so on, up to vertex 12 at 330 degrees.

A rectangle is defined by four points: two pairs of opposite vertices. For a rectangle, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the diagonals must be equal in length and bisect each other. So, in the case of a regular dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle can be either sides of the dodecagon or diagonals that skip a certain number of vertices.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all equal, but the diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal that skips one vertex is longer than one that skips two, and so on.

So, to form a rectangle, we need two pairs of vertices such that the distances between them are equal and the angles between them are 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the angles between vertices are multiples of 30 degrees. So, the sides of the rectangle must correspond to vectors that are perpendicular to each other.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of vectors. Each vertex can be represented as a point on the unit circle with coordinates (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. So, vertex k is at (cos(30(k-1)°), sin(30(k-1)°)).

To form a rectangle, I need four points such that the vectors between them are perpendicular. Let me consider two vectors, say from point A to point B and from point A to point D. For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of steps between the vertices. If I label the vertices from 1 to 12, then moving from one vertex to another can be thought of as moving a certain number of steps around the dodecagon. For example, moving from vertex 1 to vertex 3 is two steps, which is 60 degrees.

But how does that help me form a rectangle? Maybe I need to find two pairs of vertices such that the vectors connecting them are perpendicular. Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have four vertices: A, B, C, D. For ABCD to be a rectangle, the vectors AB and AD must be perpendicular. So, vector AB is (B - A) and vector AD is (D - A). Their dot product should be zero.

Alternatively, in terms of the angles, if the sides of the rectangle are at angles θ and θ + 90°, then the vectors should have slopes that are negative reciprocals.

But maybe a better approach is to consider the number of steps between the vertices. Let's say we have a rectangle with sides that span k and m steps around the dodecagon. Then, the vectors would correspond to angles of 30k° and 30m°, and for them to be perpendicular, the difference between these angles should be 90°, which is 30°, 60°, 90°, etc.

Wait, 90° is 3 times 30°, so maybe the difference between the steps should be 3. So, if one side spans 3 steps, the other should span 6 steps? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again. If I have a rectangle, the sides must be equal and at right angles. So, if one side spans k steps, the other should span m steps such that 30(k - m) = 90°, which would mean k - m = 3. So, the difference in steps between the two sides should be 3.

But in a dodecagon, the maximum number of steps between two vertices is 6, because beyond that, it's shorter to go the other way. So, for example, steps of 3 and 6 would give a difference of 3, which is 90°, so that could work.

But wait, if I have a rectangle with sides spanning 3 and 6 steps, that would make a rectangle with sides of 90°, but in a regular dodecagon, is that a rectangle?

Wait, no, because the sides would not necessarily be equal. Wait, no, in a regular dodecagon, all sides are equal, but the diagonals can be of different lengths. So, if I have a rectangle, the sides must be equal, but the diagonals must also be equal.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of edges between the vertices. For a rectangle, the sides must be equal in length, but the diagonals must also be equal. So, perhaps the number of edges between the vertices must be such that the vectors are equal in length and perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices. Let’s say the dodecagon is centered at the origin with radius 1. Then, each vertex k is at (cos(30(k-1)°), sin(30(k-1)°)).

So, for four points A, B, C, D to form a rectangle, the vectors AB and AD must be perpendicular. So, if A is at (cos θ, sin θ), then B is at (cos(θ + α), sin(θ + α)), and D is at (cos(θ + β), sin(θ + β)). Then, the vectors AB and AD must satisfy (cos(θ + α) - cos θ, sin(θ + α) - sin θ) · (cos(θ + β) - cos θ, sin(θ + β) - sin θ) = 0.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a simpler way. Since the dodecagon is regular, the coordinates are symmetric, so perhaps the number of rectangles can be determined by counting the number of pairs of vectors that are perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the possible side lengths. In a regular dodecagon, the possible distances between vertices can be calculated using the chord length formula: 2 * R * sin(π * n / 12), where n is the number of steps between vertices. Since R is 1, the chord length is 2 * sin(π * n / 12).

So, for n = 1, the chord length is 2 * sin(π / 12) ≈ 0.5176.

For n = 2, it's 2 * sin(π / 6) = 1.

For n = 3, it's 2 * sin(π / 4) ≈ 1.4142.

For n = 4, it's 2 * sin(π / 3) ≈ 1.732.

For n = 5, it's 2 * sin(5π / 12) ≈ 1.9318.

For n = 6, it's 2 * sin(π / 2) = 2.

Wait, but in a dodecagon, the maximum n is 6 because beyond that, it's shorter to go the other way. So, n can be from 1 to 6.

So, the possible chord lengths are 2 sin(π/12), 2 sin(π/6), 2 sin(π/4), 2 sin(π/3), 2 sin(5π/12), and 2 sin(π/2). These are approximately 0.5176, 1, 1.4142, 1.732, 1.9318, and 2.

Now, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of equal and parallel sides, and the diagonals must be equal. So, the sides of the rectangle must be two different chord lengths, and the diagonals must be equal. But wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal, so the diagonals must be the same length.

But in a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can be of different lengths. So, for a rectangle, the diagonals must be equal, so they must correspond to the same chord length.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can be of different lengths, but for a rectangle, the diagonals must be equal. So, the diagonals must correspond to the same chord length.

So, for example, if I have a rectangle with sides of chord lengths a and b, then the diagonals must be equal to the chord length corresponding to some n. So, the diagonals must be equal to 2 sin(π * m / 12) for some m.

But in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal to the square root of (a² + b²). So, we have that sqrt(a² + b²) must be equal to 2 sin(π * m / 12) for some m.

So, perhaps I can find all pairs of chord lengths a and b such that sqrt(a² + b²) is also a chord length.

Let me list the chord lengths:

n=1: 2 sin(π/12) ≈ 0.5176

n=2: 2 sin(π/6) = 1

n=3: 2 sin(π/4) ≈ 1.4142

n=4: 2 sin(π/3) ≈ 1.732

n=5: 2 sin(5π/12) ≈ 1.9318

n=6: 2 sin(π/2) = 2

So, the chord lengths are approximately 0.5176, 1, 1.4142, 1.732, 1.9318, 2.

Now, let's compute sqrt(a² + b²) for all possible pairs and see if it's equal to another chord length.

First, let's square each chord length:

n=1: (0.5176)^2 ≈ 0.268

n=2: 1^2 = 1

n=3: (1.4142)^2 ≈ 2

n=4: (1.732)^2 ≈ 3

n=5: (1.9318)^2 ≈ 3.732

n=6: 2^2 = 4

Now, let's compute sqrt(a² + b²) for all pairs:

1. n=1 and n=2: sqrt(0.268 + 1) ≈ sqrt(1.268) ≈ 1.126. Is 1.126 a chord length? Looking at the chord lengths, the closest is 1 (n=2) and 1.4142 (n=3). So, no.

2. n=1 and n=3: sqrt(0.268 + 2) ≈ sqrt(2.268) ≈ 1.506. Not a chord length.

3. n=1 and n=4: sqrt(0.268 + 3) ≈ sqrt(3.268) ≈ 1.808. Not a chord length.

4. n=1 and n=5: sqrt(0.268 + 3.732) ≈ sqrt(4) = 2. So, 2 is a chord length (n=6). So, this is a valid pair.

5. n=1 and n=6: sqrt(0.268 + 4) ≈ sqrt(4.268) ≈ 2.066. Not a chord length.

6. n=2 and n=2: sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142, which is n=3. So, this is a valid pair.

7. n=2 and n=3: sqrt(1 + 2) ≈ sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, which is n=4. So, valid.

8. n=2 and n=4: sqrt(1 + 3) ≈ sqrt(4) = 2, which is n=6. Valid.

9. n=2 and n=5: sqrt(1 + 3.732) ≈ sqrt(4.732) ≈ 2.175. Not a chord length.

10. n=2 and n=6: sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. Not a chord length.

11. n=3 and n=3: sqrt(2 + 2) = sqrt(4) = 2, which is n=6. Valid.

12. n=3 and n=4: sqrt(2 + 3) ≈ sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236. Not a chord length.

13. n=3 and n=5: sqrt(2 + 3.732) ≈ sqrt(5.732) ≈ 2.394. Not a chord length.

14. n=3 and n=6: sqrt(2 + 4) = sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449. Not a chord length.

15. n=4 and n=4: sqrt(3 + 3) = sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449. Not a chord length.

16. n=4 and n=5: sqrt(3 + 3.732) ≈ sqrt(6.73","[3.73200000000000, '3.732']",315,"[315, '315']",False

"To solve the problem, I need to find two three-digit numbers that add up to 999 and two two-digit numbers that add up to 99. The numbers should be arranged in a 3x3 grid where the first row contains the three-digit numbers, and the second row contains the two-digit numbers. The sum of the first row should be 999, and the sum of the second row should be 99.

First, I'll denote the three-digit numbers as ABC and DEF, and the two-digit numbers as GHI and JKL. The grid would look like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
A & B & C \\
\hline
D & E & F \\
\hline
G & H & I \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Given that ABC + DEF = 999 and GHI + JKL = 99, I need to find values for A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L that satisfy these conditions.

I'll start by considering the three-digit numbers. Since their sum is 999, which is a three-digit number, the hundreds digits of the two numbers must add up to 9 or 19. However, since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, the hundreds digits can only add up to 9, as 19 would require a carryover, which isn't possible here.

So, A + D = 9. This means that A and D are complementary digits that add up to 9. Possible pairs are (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), and their reverses.

Next, I'll look at the two-digit numbers. Their sum is 99, which is a two-digit number. The tens digits of the two numbers must add up to 9, and the units digits must add up to 9 as well. This is because 99 is a multiple of 9, and the sum of the digits of 99 is 18, which is also a multiple of 9.

So, G + H = 9 and I + J = 9. This means that the tens digits of the two two-digit numbers must add up to 9, and the units digits must also add up to 9.

Now, I'll try to find specific numbers that fit these criteria. Let's start with the three-digit numbers. If I choose A = 8 and D = 1, then the hundreds digits add up to 9. Now, I need to find B, C, E, F such that ABC + DEF = 999.

Let's assume ABC = 800 + 99 = 899 and DEF = 100 + 9 = 109. Adding these together: 899 + 109 = 1008, which is too high. So, this combination doesn't work.

Let's try ABC = 810 and DEF = 189. Adding these: 810 + 189 = 999. This works! Now, let's check the two-digit numbers. GHI + JKL = 99. If I take G = 9, H = 9, I = 0, and J = 9, K = 0, L = 0, then 90 + 09 = 99. This also works.

So, the grid would be:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
8 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline
1 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

This arrangement satisfies both conditions: the three-digit numbers add up to 999, and the two-digit numbers add up to 99.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find two three-digit numbers that add up to 999 and two two-digit numbers that add up to 99. The numbers should be arranged in a 3x3 grid where the first row contains the three-digit numbers and the second row contains the two-digit numbers.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify the Three-Digit Numbers:**
   - Let the three-digit numbers be ABC and DEF.
   - We need ABC + DEF = 999.
   - Since 999 is a three-digit number, the hundreds digits of ABC and DEF must add up to 9 (without carryover).
   - Possible pairs for the hundreds digits (A and D) are (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), and their reverses.

2. **Identify the Two-Digit Numbers:**
   - Let the two-digit numbers be GHI and JKL.
   - We need GHI + JKL = 99.
   - Since 99 is a two-digit number, the tens digits of GHI and JKL must add up to 9, and the units digits must also add up to 9.

3. **Assign Values to the Grid:**
   - Choose A = 8 and D = 1 (since 8 + 1 = 9).
   - Choose G = 9 and H = 9 (since 9 + 9 = 18, which is a multiple of 9).
   - Choose I = 0 and J = 9 (since 0 + 9 = 9).
   - Choose K = 0 and L = 0 (since 0 + 0 = 0).

4. **Construct the Grid:**
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   8 & 1 & 0 \\
   \hline
   1 & 8 & 9 \\
   \hline
   9 & 9 & 0 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

5. **Verify the Sums:**
   - Three-digit numbers: 810 + 189 = 999.
   - Two-digit numbers: 90 + 09 = 99.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the absolute value of the logarithm base 2 of \(x^4 y^3 z^2\), given three equations involving logarithms. The variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are all positive real numbers. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

I need to find \(|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\). Hmm, okay. Since all the logarithms are base 2, maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:

\(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)

Converting this to exponential form, we get:

\(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2}\)

So, equation 1 becomes:

\(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\)  [Equation A]

Similarly, let's convert the second equation:

\(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)

Exponential form:

\(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{2}\)

So, equation 2 becomes:

\(y = xz \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)  [Equation B]

And the third equation:

\(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

Exponential form:

\(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{2}\)

So, equation 3 becomes:

\(z = xy \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}\)  [Equation C]

Now, I have three equations:

A: \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\)

B: \(y = xz \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)

C: \(z = xy \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}\)

I need to solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). It seems like a system of equations with three variables. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of another and substitute.

Let me try to express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other.

From equation A: \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\)

From equation B: \(y = xz \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)

From equation C: \(z = xy \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}\)

Hmm, this seems a bit circular. Maybe I can substitute equation A into equation B.

From equation A: \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\), so I can substitute this into equation B.

Equation B: \(y = xz \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)

Substituting \(x\):

\(y = (yz \cdot \sqrt{2}) \cdot z \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)

Simplify:

\(y = y z^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)

Let me write \(\sqrt{2}\) as \(2^{1/2}\) and \(\sqrt[3]{2}\) as \(2^{1/3}\). So:

\(y = y z^2 \cdot 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3}\)

Combine the exponents:

\(2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} = 2^{(1/2 + 1/3)} = 2^{5/6}\)

So, equation becomes:

\(y = y z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\)

Divide both sides by \(y\) (since \(y\) is positive, it's non-zero):

\(1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\)

So, \(z^2 = \frac{1}{2^{5/6}} = 2^{-5/6}\)

Therefore, \(z = \sqrt{2^{-5/6}} = 2^{-5/12}\)

Wait, let me check that:

\(z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\), so \(z = (2^{-5/6})^{1/2} = 2^{-5/12}\). Yes, that's correct.

So, \(z = 2^{-5/12}\)

Now, let's find \(y\). From equation A: \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\), so \(x = y \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/2}\)

Simplify the exponents:

\(2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{-5/12 + 6/12} = 2^{1/12}\)

So, \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\)

From equation B: \(y = xz \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)

Substitute \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\):

\(y = (y \cdot 2^{1/12}) \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/3}\)

Simplify exponents:

First, \(2^{1/12} \cdot 2^{-5/12} = 2^{(1 - 5)/12} = 2^{-4/12} = 2^{-1/3}\)

Then, \(2^{-1/3} \cdot 2^{1/3} = 2^{0} = 1\)

So, \(y = y \cdot 1\), which simplifies to \(y = y\). Hmm, that doesn't give me new information. Maybe I need to use equation C.

From equation C: \(z = xy \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}\)

We know \(z = 2^{-5/12}\), so:

\(2^{-5/12} = x y \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

But from equation A, \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\), so substitute that in:

\(2^{-5/12} = (y \cdot 2^{1/12}) \cdot y \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Simplify:

\(2^{-5/12} = y^2 \cdot 2^{1/12 + 1/4}\)

Convert \(1/4\) to twelfths: \(1/4 = 3/12\), so:

\(2^{-5/12} = y^2 \cdot 2^{(1 + 3)/12} = y^2 \cdot 2^{4/12} = y^2 \cdot 2^{1/3}\)

So, \(2^{-5/12} = y^2 \cdot 2^{1/3}\)

Let me solve for \(y^2\):

\(y^2 = 2^{-5/12} / 2^{1/3} = 2^{-5/12 - 4/12} = 2^{-9/12} = 2^{-3/4}\)

Therefore, \(y = \sqrt{2^{-3/4}} = 2^{-3/8}\)

Wait, let me verify:

\(y^2 = 2^{-3/4}\), so \(y = (2^{-3/4})^{1/2} = 2^{-3/8}\). Yes, correct.

Now, from equation A: \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\)

Substitute \(y = 2^{-3/8}\):

\(x = 2^{-3/8} \cdot 2^{1/12}\)

Combine exponents:

\(2^{-3/8 + 1/12}\). Let's find a common denominator, which is 24.

\(-3/8 = -9/24\), \(1/12 = 2/24\), so:

\(-9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24\)

Thus, \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)

So, now I have:

\(x = 2^{-7/24}\)

\(y = 2^{-3/8}\)

\(z = 2^{-5/12}\)

Let me write all exponents with denominator 24 to make it easier:

- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- \(y = 2^{-9/24}\) (since \(3/8 = 9/24\))
- \(z = 2^{-10/24}\) (since \(5/12 = 10/24\))

So, \(x = 2^{-7/24}\), \(y = 2^{-9/24}\), \(z = 2^{-10/24}\)

Now, I need to compute \(|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\)

First, let's compute the expression inside the absolute value:

\(x^4 y^3 z^2\)

Express each variable with exponents:

\(x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-28/24} = 2^{-7/6}\)

\(y^3 = (2^{-9/24})^3 = 2^{-27/24} = 2^{-9/8}\)

\(z^2 = (2^{-10/24})^2 = 2^{-20/24} = 2^{-5/6}\)

Multiply them together:

\(2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6}\)

Add the exponents:

\(-7/6 - 9/8 -5/6\)

First, combine the terms with denominator 6:

\(-7/6 -5/6 = -12/6 = -2\)

Now, add \(-9/8\):

\(-2 - 9/8 = -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8\)

So, the product is \(2^{-25/8}\)

Therefore, \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8\)

Taking the absolute value, we get \(25/8\)

So, \(|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = 25/8\)

The problem says this is equal to \(m/n\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers. So, \(m = 25\), \(n = 8\). Therefore, \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}

Given the system of logarithmic equations:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = \sqrt{2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = \sqrt[3]{2}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = \sqrt[4]{2}\)

From these, we derive the following equations:

1. \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\)
2. \(y = xz \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)
3. \(z = xy \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}\)

We express each variable in terms of another and substitute:

- From equation 1: \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\)
- From equation 2: \(y = xz \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\)
- From equation 3: \(z = xy \cdot \sqrt[4]{2}\)

Substituting \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\) into equation 2:

\[y = (yz \cdot \sqrt{2}) \cdot z \cdot \sqrt[3]{2}\]
\[y = y z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\]
\[1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\]
\[z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\]
\[z = 2^{-5/12}\]

Using \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) in equation 1:

\[x = y \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/2}\]
\[x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\]

Using \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\) in equation 3:

\[2^{-5/12} = (y \cdot 2^{1/12}) \cdot y \cdot 2^{1/4}\]
\[2^{-5/12} = y^2 \cdot 2^{1/3}\]
\[y^2 = 2^{-3/4}\]
\[y = 2^{-3/8}\]

Using \(y = 2^{-3/8}\) in equation 1:

\[x = 2^{-3/8} \cdot 2^{1/12}\]
\[x = 2^{-7/24}\]

Thus, we have:

- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- \(y = 2^{-9/24}\)
- \(z = 2^{-10/24}\)

We need to find \(|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\):

\[x^4 = 2^{-28/24}\]
\[y^3 = 2^{-27/24}\]
\[z^2 = 2^{-20/24}\]

Multiplying these together:

\[2^{-28/24} \cdot 2^{-27/24} \cdot 2^{-20/24} = 2^{-75/24} = 2^{-25/","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True

"To solve the problem, we need to find a positive integer \( N \) that satisfies two conditions:

1. \( N \) is a multiple of 4 (since it's a four-digit number in base 10).
2. When \( N \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) and the remainder \( R \) satisfy \( Q + R = 1000 \).

First, let's express \( N \) in terms of \( Q \) and \( R \):
\[ N = 1000Q + R \]

Given that \( Q + R = 1000 \), we can substitute \( R \) with \( 1000 - Q \):
\[ N = 1000Q + (1000 - Q) \]
\[ N = 999Q + 1000 \]

Since \( N \) must be a four-digit number, it must satisfy:
\[ 1000 \leq N \leq 9999 \]

Substituting the expression for \( N \):
\[ 1000 \leq 999Q + 1000 \leq 9999 \]

Subtracting 1000 from all parts:
\[ 0 \leq 999Q \leq 8999 \]

Dividing by 999:
\[ 0 \leq Q \leq \frac{8999}{999} \]
\[ 0 \leq Q \leq 8.998 \]

Since \( Q \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( Q \) are 0, 1, 2, ..., 8.

However, \( Q \) represents the quotient when \( N \) is divided by 1000, so \( Q \) must be at least 1 because \( N \) is a four-digit number. Therefore, \( Q \) can be 1, 2, ..., 8.

Now, let's find the corresponding \( R \) for each \( Q \):
- If \( Q = 1 \), then \( R = 1000 - 1 = 999 \)
- If \( Q = 2 \), then \( R = 1000 - 2 = 998 \)
- ...
- If \( Q = 8 \), then \( R = 1000 - 8 = 992 \)

Each pair \( (Q, R) \) satisfies \( Q + R = 1000 \).

Finally, we need to find \( Q + R \):
\[ Q + R = 1000 \]

Thus, the sum of \( Q \) and \( R \) is always 1000.

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

**Given:**
1. \( N \) is a four-digit number (i.e., \( 1000 \leq N \leq 9999 \)).
2. When \( N \) is divided by 1000, the quotient is \( Q \) and the remainder is \( R \), such that \( Q + R = 1000 \).

**Express \( N \) in terms of \( Q \) and \( R \):**
\[ N = 1000Q + R \]

**Using the given condition \( Q + R = 1000 \):**
\[ R = 1000 - Q \]

**Substitute \( R \) into the equation for \( N \):**
\[ N = 1000Q + (1000 - Q) \]
\[ N = 999Q + 1000 \]

**Determine the range of \( Q \):**
Since \( N \) is a four-digit number:
\[ 1000 \leq 999Q + 1000 \leq 9999 \]

Subtract 1000 from all parts:
\[ 0 \leq 999Q \leq 8999 \]

Divide by 999:
\[ 0 \leq Q \leq \frac{8999}{999} \]
\[ 0 \leq Q \leq 8.998 \]

Since \( Q \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( Q \) are 1, 2, ..., 8.

**Find \( Q + R \):**
\[ Q + R = Q + (1000 - Q) = 1000 \]

"Okay, so I have this problem about a torus T and a sphere S. The torus is created by rotating a circle with radius r_i around an axis, and the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus is placed such that it's tangent to the sphere, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 3 units. The torus is also tangent to the sphere along a circle, which means it's touching the sphere along a circular path. 

The problem states that the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere along the axis of rotation. So, the center of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the sphere. Since the sphere has a radius of 11, and the torus is tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii. 

Wait, actually, since the torus is inside the sphere, the distance between their centers plus the radius of the torus should equal the radius of the sphere. But hold on, the torus is tangent to the sphere, so the distance between centers plus the radius of the torus should equal the radius of the sphere. But the sphere has a radius of 11, and the distance between centers is 3. So, 3 + r_i = 11, which would make r_i = 8. But wait, the problem says the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Let me think again. The torus is placed such that it's tangent to the sphere, and the center of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the sphere. So, the distance between centers is 6. The sphere has a radius of 11, and the torus is tangent to the sphere. So, the distance between centers plus the radius of the torus should equal the radius of the sphere. So, 6 + r_i = 11, which gives r_i = 5. But wait, the problem says the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere, so maybe the radius of the torus is 5? Hmm, that seems conflicting.

Wait, no, actually, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is tangent to the sphere. So, the distance between centers is 6, and the radius of the sphere is 11. So, the radius of the torus must be 11 - 6 = 5. So, r_i = 5. But the problem also mentions that the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere, which is the axis of rotation. So, the center of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the sphere.

Now, the torus is also tangent to the sphere along a circle. So, the torus is like a ring around the sphere, touching it along a circle. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6 units, and the radius of the torus is 5 units. So, the radius of the torus is 5, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6. So, the radius of the torus is 5, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6. So, the radius of the torus is 5, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6.

Wait, but the problem says that the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere, and the sphere has radius 11. So, the center of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the sphere, and the sphere has radius 11. So, the radius of the torus must be 11 - 6 = 5. So, r_i = 5.

But then, the problem also mentions that the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere, and that the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. So, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6, and the radius of the torus is 5. So, the radius of the torus is 5, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6.

But then, the problem says that the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere, and that the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere along the axis of rotation. Wait, that might be a translation issue. Maybe it's saying that the center of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the sphere along the axis of rotation.

So, the center of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the sphere along the axis of rotation, which is the line around which the torus is rotated. So, the center of the torus is 6 units away from the center of the sphere, and the sphere has radius 11, so the radius of the torus is 11 - 6 = 5. So, r_i = 5.

But then, the problem also mentions that the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, which is the intersection of the torus and the sphere. So, the torus is at a distance of 6 units from the center of the sphere, and the radius of the torus is 5. So, the radius of the torus is 5, and the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is 6.
